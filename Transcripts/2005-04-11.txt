17 Q. Can you tell me a little bit about what that

18 title involves in terms of work?

19 A. Dealing with the media, and the community,

20 and various other assignments.

21 Q. Such as?

22 A. Whatever came up. Getting -- arranging to

23 get awards, arranging for coverage in newspapers,

24 magazines. Assisting in the -- with the fan clubs,

25 et cetera.

26 Q. All right. Would it be fair to say that you

8 “Thank you for your services. They’re no longer

9 needed.”

10 Q. Did you ever receive any explanation as to

11 why you were being terminated?

12 A. That, “We were restructuring” --

13 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; hearsay.

14 THE WITNESS: -- “and going in a different

15 direction.” That was in the letter.

16 THE COURT: Just a moment. Just a moment,

17 please.

18 THE WITNESS: I don’t know what you’re

19 saying.

20 THE COURT: All right. I’m going to overrule

21 the objection, but I’ll limit the examination in

22 that area.

23 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: All right. As far as

24 your understanding as to why you were being

25 terminated, can you tell us what you believe to be

26 the reason why you were being terminated?

27 A. Well, I can only cite the letter that I

28 received. 5523



1 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. No foundation;

2 and irrelevant opinion.

3 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I’ll rephrase it.

4 THE COURT: All right.

5 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Were you informed as to

6 the reason for your termination with Michael Jackson

7 as his man in charge of public relations?

8 A. No, because at all times --

9 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; nonresponsive.

10 THE COURT: I’ll allow the answer, “No.”

11 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: All right. So you were

12 never given an explanation as to why you were being

13 terminated?

14 A. At all times --

15 Q. That’s a yes or no, question, sir.

16 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; nonresponsive.

17 THE COURT: Overruled. The question was,

18 “All right. So you were never given an explanation

19 as to why you were being terminated?” Is that true?

20 THE WITNESS: The letter, yes. The letter.

21 That’s all I can say.

22 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Okay. Now, one thing

23 we have to be careful about in the question and

24 answer of your examination is we have to be careful

25 we don’t talk over each other, so the reporter can

26 get everything down.

27 A. Okay.

28 Q. And you have to be careful just to answer 5524



1 the question that’s asked. All right?

2 A. Okay.

3 Q. Thank you.

4 So I believe you testified you were

5 terminated late in 2004; is that correct?

6 A. Yes.

7 Q. And since that time have you had any

8 employment?

9 A. No.

10 Q. Have you been involved in any activity at

11 this time concerning -- during that period of time

12 since your termination that concerns your years of

13 employment with Michael Jackson?

14 A. Yes.

15 Q. What is that?

16 A. I went to the State of California and filed

17 a complaint for my vacation pay.

18 Q. All right. Other than that, have you been

19 involved in the writing of any memoirs of your years

20 with Michael Jackson?

21 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; leading.

22 THE COURT: Overruled.

23 THE WITNESS: Is it --

24 THE COURT: You may answer.

25 THE WITNESS: Yes.

26 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: And can you

7 Q. During your years of working with Michael

8 Jackson, did you have occasion to spend time with

9 him personally?

10 A. Seldom.

11 Q. Who was it that hired you?

12 A. Michael Jackson.

1 A. I would say approximately ‘92.

2 Q. How long did that trip take?

3 A. The trip probably lasted about ten days.

4 Q. And did you travel with Mr. Jackson to

5 Monaco?

7 Q. Did Mr. Jackson bring any guests with him on

8 that trip?

15 A. Of course.

16 Q. How often?

17 A. We -- well, whenever I saw one, I saw the

18 other.

19 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: If I may approach, Your

9 when you were watching Mr. Jackson and Jordie

13 Q. Have you been interviewed by police officers

15 A. Not that I recall.

16 Q. Didn’t you have an interview with Steve

17 Robel and your attorney and myself last week in the

18 victim/witness room --

19 A. Yes.

20 Q. -- concerning this incident?

21 A. Yes, yes, yes.

22 Q. At that meeting, didn’t you tell Mr. Robel

23 and myself and your attorney that you weren’t sure

24 if that happened?

25 A. I was very --

26 MR. MESEREAU: Objection.

27 THE WITNESS: I was adamant in saying I was

28 not sure that that happened. I could -- I could 5530



1 definitely say that they were embraced in one

2 another’s arms on the flight, but I don’t recall

3 anything about head licking.

4 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: My question is, didn’t

5 you say that you didn’t remember that, but you

6 weren’t sure whether or not Mr. Jackson licked

7 Jordie Chandler’s head?

8 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Leading, and

9 argumentative, and misstates the evidence.

10 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: This is impeachment, Your

11 Honor.

12 THE COURT: The objection is overruled.

13 You may answer.

14 THE WITNESS: I might have said that. But I

15 don’t recall.

16 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: You don’t recall

17 whether you said that?

18 A. No, I don’t recall ever seeing any head

19 licking, and I made that as adamant as I could.

20 Q. All right. So is it your testimony today

21 that you don’t have a recollection of the head

22 licking --

23 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Argumentative,

24 and asked and answered, and leading.

25 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I don’t think I’ve gotten

26 an answer yet.

27 THE COURT: Well, you haven’t got the

28 question out, so go ahead and state your question. 5531



1 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I’m trying to clarify

2 the state of your memory, sir.

3 A. Sure.

4 Q. Is it your testimony today that you do not

5 remember whether or not you saw any head licking?

6 A. No. I don’t remember having seen any head

7 licking.

8 Q. Okay. So is it fair to say you were not

9 saying it couldn’t have happened?

10 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; argumentative.

11 THE COURT: Sustained.

12 MR. MESEREAU: Calls for speculation.

13 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Are you saying you just

14 simply do not have a recollection of it?

15 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Asked and

16 answered; argumentative; and leading.

17 THE COURT: Sustained.

18 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Mr. Jones, you said

19 you’re writing a book in this case?

20 A. Sure.

21 Q. What is the title of that book?

22 A. “The Man Behind the Mask.”

23 Q. What is the complete title of that book?

24 A. “The Man” --

25 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Objection.

26 Hearsay; relevance.

27 THE COURT: Overruled.

28 You may answer. 5532



1 THE WITNESS: Oh. “The Man Behind the

2 Mask.” In all honesty, I don’t -- I can’t tell you

3 the subtitle.

4 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: You don’t recall the

5 name of your book?

6 A. No, I don’t recall the subtitle. I do know

7 “An Insider’s View of the Rise and Fall of the King

8 of Pop.” Maybe that’s it.

9 Q. Is the name of your book, “Michael Jackson,

10 The Man in the Mirror, An Insider’s Account of the

11 King of Pop’s Spectacular and Catastrophic Fall from

12 Grace”?

13 THE WITNESS: No.

14 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Leading; hearsay.

15 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: That is not the title

16 of your book?

17 A. The “Catastrophic” --

18 THE COURT: Just a moment. There’s an

19 objection.

20 It’s overruled.

21 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: All right.

22 THE WITNESS: “Catastrophic Fall” was taken

23 out. It was a suggested title and I took that

24 “Catastrophic” out. And it isn’t “The Man Behind

25 the Mirror.” It’s “The Man Behind the Mask.” Maybe

26 one of the suggested titles was that other that I

27 did not approve of.

28 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Is your book presently 5533



1 at the publisher?

2 A. It is being edited, but the book is not

3 complete. It is far from complete.

4 Q. Is your book presently at the publisher?

5 A. Yes, sir.

6 Q. What’s the name of that publisher?

7 A. System, I think. My co-writer handled that

8 end of it.

9 Q. And your book is currently being edited?

10 A. Yes.

11 Q. Has it been accepted by the publisher as a

12 prospect for publication?

13 A. It has been, but it has not been approved by

14 me.

15 Q. The manuscript that is at the publisher --

16 well, let me strike that.

17 Is the book that is being reviewed by your

18 publisher currently an honest account of your years

19 working with Michael Jackson?

20 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Calls for

21 speculation; irrelevant opinion.

22 THE COURT: Sustained.

23 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Have you reviewed the

24 manuscript that is at the publisher’s?

25 A. I have looked at a manuscript that has not

26 been approved by me.

27 Q. How many times have you looked at this

28 manuscript? 5534



1 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; relevance.

2 THE COURT: I’m not sure where you’re going

3 with this. Are you -- is it your intent to impeach

4 him with his manuscript, is that what you’re --

5 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Yes.

6 THE COURT: All right. The objection is

7 overruled.

8 THE WITNESS: Perhaps I’ve looked at it twice

9 and I have -- I have a co-writer.

10 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Okay. This manuscript

11 that you’ve looked at, is it fact or fiction?

12 A. It’s part --

13 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; no foundation.

14 There’s a co-writer. It’s not been approved. It’s

15 being edited by some other people.

16 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I’m talking about the

17 manuscript he’s looked at.

18 THE COURT: Objection’s overruled.

19 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Is this a factual

20 manuscript or is it a fictional manuscript?

21 A. It is factual to a degree.

22 Q. To what degree is it factual?

23 A. It’s to a degree, because I -- my co-writer

24 also has included things that I didn’t approve of.

25 Q. I’m going to read to you a quote from that

26 manuscript and ask you whether it’s factual or

27 fiction.

28 A. Sure. 5535



1 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Can we approach

2 the bench, Your Honor?

3 THE COURT: Just a moment.

4 Before you can impeach him with the

5 manuscript, you have to establish a foundation that

6 he, in fact, wrote this part that you want to

7 impeach him with.

8 I’ll allow you to approach the witness and

9 show it to him, but I’m not going to allow you to

10 read in open court something that may have been

11 written by somebody else.

12 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: That’s fine, Your Honor.

13 Q. Mr. Jones, I show you People’s Exhibit No.

14 803. It appears to be one page of typed -- this is

15 a word-processed document.

16 A. Okay.

17 Q. And it’s dated March 7th, 2005. There are

18 two paragraphs below the exhibit number. If you’d

19 read those two paragraphs, I’m going to ask you a

20 couple of questions about it.

21 A. Sure. “He’s one of the young” --

22 Q. Just a moment. Just read them silently.

23 A. Oh. Okay.

24 I did not write this. This I did write.

25 Q. All right.

26 THE COURT: So did he show you one he wrote

27 and one he didn’t write?

28 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Yes. And for the record, 5536



1 he indicated --

2 Q. If I’m accurate, Mr. Jones, you indicated

3 the first paragraph in the lower portion of the page

4 you didn’t write, but the second paragraph you did

5 write?

6 A. Yes.

7 THE COURT: Is that clear to you which he

8 indicated, Counsel?

9 MR. MESEREAU: I think so, but I’d like to

10 talk to the prosecutor first. I think I understand.

11 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: All right. That second

12 paragraph -- Mr. Jones, that second paragraph is an

13 account of what you observed at the World Music

14 Awards; is that accurate?

15 A. That’s what I observed on the airplane.

16 Q. Okay. In that paragraph, it states --

17 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; hearsay.

18 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: It’s impeachment. And I

19 can show it to you, Your Honor.

20 THE COURT: The objection’s overruled.

21 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: It states, “I looked at

22 what was going on with the king and the boy.” Who

23 is “the king” in your --

24 A. The king of pop, Michael Jackson.

25 Q. All right. “Others looked at them rather

26 strange, too. They were holding each other tight,

27 almost in a romantic sense, cooing. There were

28 pecks on the cheeks and licks on the top of the 5537



1 head.”

2 Those are your words, sir, true?

3 A. Sir --

4 Q. That’s a “yes” or “no” question.

5 A. Yes, with reservations.

6 Q. Mr. Jones, did you see Michael Jackson lick

7 Jordie’s head?

8 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; asked and

9 answered.

10 THE COURT: Sustained.

11 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: If I may approach, Your

12 Honor.

13 THE COURT: Yes.

14 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Mr. Jones, I show you

15 People’s Exhibit 804. It appears to be an e-mail.

16 Can you identify that for me, please?

17 A. It’s from an e-mail that I sent to Stacy

18 Brown, my co-writer.

19 Q. The cite -- well, I won’t quote, but that is

20 your e-mail address at the top?

21 A. Yes, yes.

22 Q. And those are your words?

23 A. If they were sent by my e-mail, yes, they

24 have to be my words.

25 Q. You don’t dispute that those are your words?

26 A. No.

27 Q. And I show you People’s Exhibit No. 805. If

28 you’d identify that for me, please. Also appears to 5538



1 be an e-mail dated the same date, but the time on it

2 is 22:30:17 EDT.

3 The first one, for identification purposes,

4 804, is dated -- the time on it is 19:55:32 EDT.

5 Okay. So showing you Exhibit 805, is that

6 one of your e-mails, sir?

7 A. Well, they’re both from my e-mail.

8 Q. All right. You wrote them?

9 A. Yes.

10 Q. And in the first e-mail, 804 --

11 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; hearsay.

12 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Offered as impeachment.

13 THE COURT: All right. Overruled.

14 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: You wrote -- and

15 this -- first of all, let me ask you, is the date of

16 this e-mail accurate, October 30th, 2004?

17 A. I would imagine it is, sir.

18 Q. In that e-mail, you wrote, “Stacy: The

19 licking is going to be important because he did it

20 in this case, too.” Are those your words, sir?

21 A. Apparently so.

22 Q. And in the e-mail that was dated the same

23 day just a few hours later, did you write, “Stacy:

24 The stuff with Jordie will bite him big”?

25 A. If it’s -- if it came from my e-mail, I

26 wrote it. But I don’t -- that sounds a little

27 strange from my writing.

28 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Thank you. I have no 5539



1 further questions.

2 THE COURT: Cross-examine?

3 MR. MESEREAU: Yes, please, Your Honor.

4

5 CROSS-EXAMINATION

6 BY MR. MESEREAU:

7 Q. Good morning, Mr. Jones.

8 A. Good morning.

9 Q. My name is Tom Mesereau and I speak for

10 Michael Jackson.

11 A. Sure.

12 Q. We haven’t met before, right?

13 A. No.

14 Q. Okay. The prosecutor referred to an

15 interview that you had with Sergeant Steve Robel and

16 another officer on April 7th, 2005.

17 A. Uh-huh.

18 Q. Do you remember that?

19 A. Yes.

20 Q. And do you remember you were asked by an

21 officer, “Um, did you see Mr Jackson engage in any

22 head licking in the World Music Awards?” And your

23 answer was, “No, no, no,” right?

24 A. Uh-huh.

25 Q. And then you were asked, “Um, did you see

26 Mr. Jackson engage in any head licking of anybody?”

27 And your answer was, “Never.” Remember that?

28 A. I recall. 5540



1 Q. Okay. And what you were not -- when you

2 were dealing with your co-writer and publisher, you

3 were not under oath, were you?

4 A. No.

5 Q. And of course today you are, right?

6 A. Yes.

7 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection; argumentative.

8 THE COURT: Overruled. Next question. He

9 answered that.

10 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: The reality is, Mr. Jones,

11 you have repeatedly said you don’t recall seeing

12 head licking on the plane, right?

13 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection; misstates the

14 evidence.

15 THE COURT: Sustained.

16 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: You don’t recall seeing

17 head licking by Michael on the plane with Jordie, do

18 you?

19 A. I said it, but it was in the -- it appeared

20 in an e-mail. I said I did not recall seeing it,

21 but it -- apparently so, because it appeared in an

22 e-mail that came from my machine.

23 Q. Well, in response to the prosecutor’s

24 questions, you said you had reservations about that

25 statement --

26 A. Yes.

27 Q. -- correct?

28 And what are your reservations about that 5541



1 statement?

2 A. That I just don’t recall exactly seeing

3 that. I truly don’t.

4 Q. And would you agree when you’re working with

5 a co-writer and a publisher to prepare a book about

6 Michael Jackson, there’s pressure to make things

7 sensational when you can, right?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. And your publisher and others want a book

10 that can sell, correct?

11 A. My co-writer. The publisher wasn’t involved

12 in that particular end of it.

13 Q. Okay. And certainly, having worked with

14 Michael all those years, you’ve seen numerous

15 attempts by numerous people to sensationalize

16 aspects of Michael’s life, right?

17 A. Correct.

18 Q. And if you’re writing a book about Michael,

19 there certainly is always a temptation to

20 sensationalize if you don’t watch yourself, right?

21 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection; argumentative.

22 THE COURT: Sustained.

23 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: How is the book being

24 written?

25 A. Well, I don’t quite understand what

26 you’re --

27 Q. Let me rephrase it. It’s probably a poor

28 question. 5542



1 You have a co-writer?

2 A. That’s correct.

3 Q. Did your co-writer ever work for Michael

4 Jackson?

5 A. No, but my co-writer knows the family.

6 Q. Okay. And you’re both trying to prepare a

7 book about your observations and experiences in the

8 past, right?

9 A. Yes.

10 Q. And the prosecutor asked you some questions

11 about what stage it’s in, right?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. And is there considerably more editing

14 required?

15 A. Most definitely.

16 Q. And is it a long ways from being published

17 as far as you’re concerned?

18 A. As far as I am concerned, and I’m supposed

19 to have final approval.

20 Q. And when you have a co-writer on a book like

21 that -- actually, let me make it more direct.

22 Does your co-writer have responsibility for

23 preparing drafts that you have to then review for

24 accuracy?

25 A. That is correct.

26 Q. Okay. And is it -- would it be appropriate

27 to say that what the prosecutor showed you has not

28 been approved for accuracy? 5543



1 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I’m going to object to any

2 further leading of this particular witness, Your

3 Honor.

4 THE COURT: Overruled.

5 You may answer. Do you want the question

6 read back?

7 THE WITNESS: Would you repeat the question,

8 please?

9 THE COURT: I’ll have the court reporter read

10 it back.

11 (Record read.)

12 THE COURT: Are you talking about Exhibit

13 803, Counsel, or not?

14 MR. MESEREAU: Yes, Your Honor.

15 THE COURT: You need to show it to him,

16 because he’s been shown three exhibits.

17 MR. MESEREAU: I don’t know -- are the

18 exhibits in front of you, Mr. Jones?

19 THE WITNESS: Exhibits? I don’t have

20 anything.

21 THE COURT: They’re not up there.

22 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor?

23 THE COURT: You may.

24 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Mr. Jones, I’m showing you

25 what has been marked as Exhibit No. 803, okay? Do

26 you see that?

27 A. Uh-huh.

28 Q. That starts off with a title that you said 5544



1 is not accurate and has not been approved, correct?

2 A. That is correct.

3 Q. And you told the prosecutor you had written

4 the words at the bottom of the page that refer to

5 licking, right?

6 A. Uh-huh.

7 Q. And is it your testimony that you have not

8 approved the accuracy of that statement?

9 A. That is correct.

10 Q. Okay. Now, the prosecutor showed you an

11 e-mail that you indicated you think you sent; is

12 that correct?

13 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection; misstates the

14 evidence.

15 THE COURT: Overruled.

16 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Do you see that?

17 A. Personally I don’t think this is in the

18 book, this statement.

19 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I’ll object as

20 nonresponsive.

21 THE COURT: I guess it’s without -- his

22 answer shows me it’s without foundation. So do you

23 want to ask a foundational question on that?

24 MR. MESEREAU: Yes.

25 Q. Mr. -- well, let me just show you. I’m

26 looking now at Exhibit 805, okay? And that’s the

27 e-mail the prosecutor referred to.

28 A. Uh-huh. 5545



1 Q. And I think you said you believe you sent

2 the e-mail; is that right?

3 A. Uh-huh.

4 Q. And are the words in that e-mail accurate as

5 far as you’re concerned?

6 A. Perhaps they are.

7 Q. You don’t know?

8 A. Because I wrote -- if it came from my e-mail

9 address, I had to write it.

10 Q. Okay. And -- but you don’t know for sure?

11 A. No.

12 Q. And are the words on that e-mail words you

13 intend to include in your book?

14 A. Not like that. My -- my co-writer is

15 handling that, and I have tried to change certain

16 things in the way things were said on numerous

17 occasions with him.

18 Q. Would it be accurate to say that neither

19 Exhibit 803 nor Exhibit 805 are accurate as far as

20 you’re concerned?

21 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection; misstates the

22 evidence --

23 THE COURT: Overruled.

24 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: -- as far as to 803.

25 THE COURT: Overruled.

26 You may answer.

27 THE WITNESS: Well, I don’t know which

28 one -- you got three different things there, don’t 5546



1 you?

2 MR. MESEREAU: Sure.

3 May I approach, Your Honor?

4 THE COURT: Yeah.

5 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Showing you Exhibit 803

6 and Exhibit 805, okay?

7 A. This is three. This is five.

8 Q. Yes. Okay? Let’s talk about 803. You’ve

9 already indicated the title -- what purports to be

10 the title is not going to be the title of your book,

11 right?

12 A. That’s correct.

13 Q. And you’ve already indicated that the bottom

14 paragraph that you say you wrote is not accurate; is

15 that correct?

16 A. Uh-huh. This I wrote.

17 Q. Yes.

18 A. Yes.

19 Q. But you’re indicating it’s not accurate,

20 true?

21 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection; misstates the

22 evidence.

23 THE COURT: Overruled.

24 You may answer.

25 THE WITNESS: Not completely true as far as

26 I’m concerned.

27 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Okay. Let’s look at the

28 next exhibit, which is Exhibit No. 805. Do you see 5547



1 that?

2 A. Yes. This -- this one is true. I’m sorry.

3 Yes. I’m sorry.

4 Q. And you wrote that e-mail, correct?

5 A. Yes. Yes.

6 Q. And what you said in the e-mail was, in

7 summary, that you might -- and correct me if I’m

8 wrong, that you thought your knowledge of the

9 Chandlers might be an insurance policy for you?

10 A. Uh-huh.

11 Q. Correct?

12 A. Uh-huh.

13 Q. An insurance policy of employment, right?

14 A. Uh-huh.

15 Q. And what that means is, “I might try and

16 hold over Michael’s head what I could say about the

17 Chandlers,” right?

18 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I’m going to object to

19 counsel ascribing any meaning to those words.

20 THE COURT: Sustained.

21 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: What did you mean by

22 “insurance policy of employment”?

23 A. Well, I was not -- I did not have a

24 confidentiality agreement.

25 Q. Okay.

26 A. That’s what I -- that’s what I basically

27 meant.

28 Q. And did you also mean that, “Because I’ve 5548



1 spent all these years with Michael, that I could

2 almost use as a threat writing an expose of him if

3 I’m not employed by him”?

4 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Same objection. And

5 argumentative.

6 THE COURT: Overruled.

7 You may answer.

8 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Is that sort of what it

9 means?

10 A. No, not really, because I have never -- I

11 have never sued, I have never sold stories. I have

12 never -- in the 16 and a half years, I’ve never

13 attempted to extort in any manner.

14 Q. And I’m not saying you did. I’m just asking

15 you --

16 A. No, no, I did not mean it in that respect.

17 Q. Okay. Now, when did you say your work was

18 terminated?

19 A. June 9th, 2004.

20 Q. Okay. And where was your office at the

21 time?

22 A. In my home.

23 Q. You indicated in response to the

24 prosecutor’s question that you didn’t see Michael

25 very often, right?

26 A. No.

27 Q. And why was that?

28 A. This was -- this was Michael Jackson’s modus 5549



1 operandi from the very beginning. I saw Michael

2 mostly if we were on a tour that my presence -- if I

3 may explain. I have worked in the entertainment

4 industry prior to working with Michael Jackson for

5 17 and a half years, and I know familiarity breeds

6 contempt. And the further you stay away from

7 artists, the better off you are.

8 Q. And for that reason, did you not go to

9 Neverland very much?

10 A. I went to Neverland when I brought groups

11 up, such as the Challengers Boys & Girls Club. Such

12 as the First AME Church, et cetera. I was not a

13 regular visitor at Neverland at all.

14 Q. Now, who was the first group that you

15 mentioned that you brought?

16 A. The Challengers Boys --

17 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection. Relevance;

18 beyond the scope.

19 THE COURT: Sustained.

20 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: In a typical year, while

21 you were employed, how often would you visit

22 Neverland?

23 A. I haven’t been to Neverland in years. My

24 visits to Neverland were on a more frequent basis

25 about five years ago when I was able to get groups

26 approved to go to Neverland.

27 Q. Okay. And you had an office located where?

28 A. Before we closed the offices, we were at 5550



1 9255 Sunset Boulevard.

2 Q. Okay. And how many years did you spend in

3 that office?

4 A. I think we were there approximately ten

5 years, I think. I cannot be for certain.

6 Q. Okay. Now, you indicated at the music

7 awards, the World Music Awards, that at one point

8 you saw Jordie on Michael Jackson’s lap and his

9 sister on Michael Jackson’s lap together, right?

10 A. That is correct.

11 Q. Okay. And where was Michael Jackson sitting

12 in that event?

13 A. He was seated on the front row next to

14 Prince Albert of Monaco, and -- on one side, and

15 Linda Evans, the actress, on the other side.

16 And I attempted to get -- I had arranged for

17 the Chandlers to sit directly behind Mr. Jackson,

18 because I did not feel that the royalty wanted to be

19 bothered with those guests. But he insisted that

20 they sit with him, so I left it alone.

21 Q. Did the mother sit with Michael Jackson as

22 well?

23 A. Behind.

24 Q. Okay. So when you saw the brother and

25 sister sitting on Michael Jackson’s lap in the first

26 row, the mother was right behind, correct?

27 A. Correct.

28 Q. So this is the first row in full view of 5551



1 everyone at the awards show, correct?

2 A. That is correct.

3 Q. There was no effort to hide anything at any

4 time?

5 A. No.

6 Q. At some point, did you see the children with

7 their mother behind where Michael Jackson was

8 sitting?

9 A. When I brought them in to their seats, they

10 were seated behind Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson moved

11 them up front.

12 Q. Okay. Did -- when you say he moved them up

13 front, did he move them into seats up front?

14 A. He moved them into his seat.

15 Q. Okay. Okay. So the children moved into his

16 seat to sit with him?

17 A. With him.

18 Q. And the mother still stayed sitting behind?

19 A. That is correct.

20 Q. And at some point did you see the children

21 go back with their mother or did they always stay

22 with Michael?

23 A. No, they stayed up there.

24 Q. And I think at one point you saw Jordie

25 still sitting on Michael’s lap, and Jordie’s sister

26 sitting on Linda Evans’ lap?

27 A. That is correct.

28 Q. Please tell the jury what the World Music 5552



1 Awards show is.

2 A. The World Music Awards show is a show that’s

3 given annually in Monte Carlo for the best record

4 sales in -- the best worldwide record sales.

5 I had arranged for Mr. Jackson to be honored

6 by the World Music Awards, and -- because of his

7 record sales. And we had gone there for that

8 particular purpose, for him to be honored by the

9 World Music Awards. And to be seen around the

10 world. And I attempted, because perception is 90

11 percent of what the public thinks, to get those

12 people off of his lap.

13 Q. Did the Chandler family seem to remain

14 during the entire show sitting with Michael?

15 A. Oh, of course. Yes.

16 Q. Okay. Now, you -- how did you get to

17 Monaco?

18 A. We flew.

19 Q. Did you -- fly from where?

20 A. Los Angeles.

21 Q. Okay. And were there other stops on that

22 trip?

23 A. To Paris. We flew from Los Angeles to

24 Paris, and Paris to Nice, and we helicoptered to

25 Monte Carlo.

26 Q. Okay. Do you recall attending any other

27 events with Mr. Jackson on the trip to Monaco?

28 A. Of course, His Royal Highness Prince Albert 5553



1 hosted a reception for visiting dignitaries, and I

2 was -- he had an event -- when you go there, they

3 have an event each night for visiting dignitaries.

4 And there was only one event that Mr. Jackson

5 attended.

6 Q. And do you recall whether or not the

7 Chandler family were at that event?

8 A. They were with him.

9 Q. And that was because Michael insisted that

10 the Chandler family go?

11 A. I don’t know whether he insisted whether

12 they attend or not.

13 Q. Okay.

14 A. But all of his guests were invited.

15 Q. Okay. Were there any other guests of

16 Michael Jackson that you haven’t named?

17 A. No, just the Chandler family.

18 Q. Okay. Now, did you begin writing your book

19 after your employment ended?

20 A. I had made notes on certain things. Yes,

21 the actual beginning of the writing of the book

22 started after my employment ended, yes.

23 Q. And has there been an effort by you or your

24 co-writer to market the book overseas?

25 A. Well, I would imagine that the publisher

26 has.

27 Q. Has there been an attempt to market it in

28 the United States? 5554



1 A. I would imagine that the publisher has.

2 Q. Okay. And who is in charge of that issue?

3 A. My co-writer.

4 Q. Okay. Now, do you typically meet with your

5 co-writer periodically?

6 A. We talk on the phone. That’s -- that’s

7 perhaps one of the reasons there is some confusion,

8 because our -- he’s based in New York and I’m based

9 in Los Angeles.

10 Q. Okay. And do you sort of fax or e-mail

11 manuscripts to one another?

12 A. We e-mail.

13 Q. Okay. And do you then typically correct or

14 change what you think is either inaccurate or

15 inappropriate?

16 A. Oh, I’ve changed millions of things that

17 were inaccurate that I didn’t say.

18 Q. And how far away from having a product that

19 you think is accurate and complete are you?

20 A. I would say six to eight weeks.

21 Q. Okay. Have you come up with a date during

22 which you intend to announce the availability of the

23 book?

24 A. No.

25 Q. Okay. Do you remember in your interview on

26 April 7th, 2005, a police officer asking you about

27 whether or not there was any licking on the plane by

28 Michael, and you said, “I just don’t remember and I 5555



1 would be lying to say that I did”?

2 A. Of course I recall saying that.

3 Q. And that was the truth, right?

4 A. Yes.

5 Q. Now, on the plane coming back, do you

6 remember where Jordie’s mother June was seated?

7 A. Sure.

8 Q. Where was she seated?

9 A. We were all in first class, and on one side

10 of the rear of first class was Michael and Jordie

11 Chandler. On the total opposite side was June

12 Chandler and her daughter.

13 Q. Certainly June and her daughter were in a

14 position to observe Michael and Jordie, correct?

15 A. That is correct.

16 Q. So they were seated parallel to one another?

17 A. Yes.

18 Q. Nothing that went on was hidden from

19 anybody, correct?

20 A. No.

21 Q. And where were you seated in relation --

22 A. I was seated at least two front -- two rows

23 ahead of them.

24 Q. How many times have you been contacted by

25 any representative of the sheriffs or police

26 department in this case?

27 A. Well, I was contacted prior to my

28 registration -- I mean, my being served with a 5556



1 subpoena. And at one point, a Richard Steingard, I

2 approached him about representation because he had

3 represented me before in this case, and then he came

4 back and said that he could not represent me any

5 longer. And that’s when Attorney Sachs was

6 contacted. So I had been -- they attempted to serve

7 a subpoena to me, and at that time I did accept the

8 subpoena at Richard Steingard’s office, and

9 following which he informed me that he could no

10 longer represent me.

11 Q. Have you ever spoken to any prosecutor for

12 the government in this case directly?

13 A. Who do you mean, the government?

14 Q. These people. The prosecutors.

15 A. Certainly. I’ve -- Mr. Auchincloss and

16 Steve Robel.

17 Q. When did you last meet with Mr. Auchincloss?

18 A. I met with him on Friday when I was told to

19 go home and come back.

20 Q. Okay. And did you meet with him before

21 that?

22 A. Of course. You mentioned an April date that

23 Mr. Auchincloss had me to come up.

24 Q. Okay. Was that April 7th?

25 A. I guess, sir. I don’t -- I’m not good with

26 dates, so --

27 Q. You had an interview with Sergeant Steve

28 Robel, right? 5557



1 A. And Mr. Auchincloss.

2 Q. Okay. How many meetings did you have with

3 Sergeant Robel, if you know?

4 A. I only met Sergeant Robel when I was with

5 Mr. Auchincloss. I met them both at the same time.

6 Q. Okay. So when you said, “I just don’t

7 remember and I would be lying to say that I did,”

8 about head licking, Mr. Auchincloss was right there,

9 right?

10 A. We were -- we were there, yes, we were --

11 the three of us were in the room.

12 Q. So he clearly heard you say that, correct?

13 A. Mr. Auchincloss was in the room with Mr.

14 Robel.

15 Q. And he tried to misquote you in court today,

16 correct?

17 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection. This is

18 argumentative; improper.

19 THE COURT: Sustained.

20 MR. MESEREAU: No further questions, Your

21 Honor.

22

23 REDIRECT EXAMINATION

24 BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

25 Q. Mr. Jones, you told Stacy Brown about this

26 head licking incident, true?

27 A. Apparently I did, sir.

28 Q. And you have previously stated that the 5558



1 words on the second paragraph of People’s Exhibit

2 803, which I’ve shown you - that’s the quotes from

3 the book --

4 A. Uh-huh.

5 Q. -- the second paragraph - those are your

6 words?

7 A. Yes.

8 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: All right. Your Honor, if

9 I may, I’d like to admit --

10 THE WITNESS: With -- with -- may I see

11 that, sir, again?

12 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Yes, you may.

13 A. Because -- it may be with exception.

14 Oh, yes, those are my words.

15 Q. All right. So you agree that those are your

16 words.

17 Your Honor, I’d like to admit People’s

18 Exhibit 803 into evidence at this time.

19 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Hearsay;

20 foundation; relevance.

21 THE COURT: Let me see the exhibit.

22 All right. The objection’s sustained. It’s

23 not going into evidence.

24 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: All right. May I see

25 that?

26 Q. But so that we’re clear today about your

27 testimony, is it true that you looked at what was

28 going on with the king and the boy, they were 5559



1 holding each other tightly, almost in a romantic

2 sense --

3 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Asked and

4 answered; move to strike.

5 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I believe there’s been --

6 THE COURT: Overruled. Go ahead.

7 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: “Holding each other

8 tightly almost in a romantic sense, cooing. There

9 were pecks on the cheeks and licks on the top of the

10 head”; is that true, those are your words?

11 A. I -- I -- with reservation. I know about

12 the -- as I told you --

13 Q. I’m asking you are those your words, sir?

14 A. They apparently are my words. If you have

15 them in an e-mail from me.

16 Q. Today your testimony is that, “The licking

17 is going to be important,” you told Stacy that,

18 “because it happened in this case, too.” Those are

19 your words as well?

20 A. I don’t recall saying anything about this

21 case. But if it was in an e-mail, I said it.

22 Q. You acknowledge that those words -- that

23 this is your e-mail address?

24 A. B7436@aol --

25 Q. And this is -- you acknowledged this is one

26 of your e-mails to Stacy Brown?

27 A. Nobody else could have done it but me.

28 Q. So do you acknowledge, based upon all the 5560



1 information that you have today, that you did, in

2 fact, see Michael Jackson lick Jordie Chandler on

3 the top of the head, sir? Yes or no.

4 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; asked and

5 answered.

6 THE WITNESS: I guess -- yes.

7 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: All right.

8 THE COURT: Just a moment. There was an

9 objection.

10 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Sorry.

11 THE COURT: The objection is overruled. The

12 answer was, “Yes.”

13 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: And your testimony is

14 that this incident happened on a plane flying back

15 from Europe?

16 A. On flying back from Paris to Los Angeles.

17 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Thank you. I have no

18 further questions.

19

20 RECROSS-EXAMINATION

21 BY MR. MESEREAU:

22 Q. Mr. Jones, on April 7th, you told the police

23 and Mr. Auchincloss you’d be lying if you said you

24 saw Mr. Jackson licking Mr. Chandler, right?

25 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection. Misstates the

26 evidence and argumentative.

27 THE COURT: Overruled.

28 You may answer. Do you want the question 5561



1 read back?

2 THE WITNESS: I would say since he -- I have

3 to say it has to be true if it came in my e-mail.

4 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: But, sir, you just told

5 the police the other day that you’d be lying if you

6 said he did that, right?

7 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Same objections.

8 THE COURT: Overruled.

9 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Right?

10 A. I -- I, again, have to say what I said. If

11 it’s in my e-mail, it’s true.

12 Q. But you just told the jury you don’t recall

13 seeing something like that, correct?

14 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection. Asked and

15 answered; argumentative.

16 THE COURT: Overruled.

17 THE WITNESS: I go back with the same

18 answer. It was in my e-mail. So if it was in my

19 e-mail, I’m taking responsibility for the e-mail.

20 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Well, but you’ve also

21 indicated a number of the things you wrote are not

22 accurate, true?

23 A. I didn’t write anything. My co-writer wrote

24 those things. But he is -- he has shown me an

25 e-mail that I wrote and sent to my co-writer.

26 Q. But, sir, you just told the jury what you

27 told the police last week, which is that you’d be

28 lying if you said you saw that, right? 5562



1 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I believe that misstates

2 the evidence.

3 THE COURT: Overruled.

4 Is that what -- he’s really asking you, “Is

5 that what you told the police?” Did you tell the

6 police --

7 THE WITNESS: Yes, that is what I told the

8 police.

9 MR. MESEREAU: No further questions.

10

11 FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION

12 BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

13 Q. Mr. Jones, you didn’t say, “I would be lying

14 if I said that.” You said, “I would be lying if I

15 said I remembered that”; isn’t that true?

16 A. Yes, I did.

17 Q. And is it fair to say that based on

18 everything you have before you today, you now

19 remember the incidents that you’ve testified

20 concerning the licking?

21 A. I don’t remember. But there is an e-mail

22 which provides explicit evidence that the e-mail

23 came from me.

24 Q. And you believe your e-mails are true;

25 you’ve testified to that?

26 A. I would not have just made it up.

27 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Thank you.

28 THE WITNESS: Okay. 5563



1 MR. MESEREAU: No further questions.

2 THE COURT: All right. Thank you. You may

3 step down.

4 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Thank you, Your Honor.

5 Subject to re-call.

6 THE COURT: All right. I haven’t excused

7 him.

8 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I’m sorry.

9 THE COURT: Call your next witness.

10 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Call Stacy Brown.

11 THE COURT: When you get to the witness

12 stand, please remain standing.

13 Face the clerk, over here, and raise your

14 right hand.

15

16 STACY BROWN

17 Having been sworn, testified as follows:

18

19 THE WITNESS: Yes.

20 THE CLERK: Please be seated. State and

21 spell your name for the record.

22 THE WITNESS: Stacy Brown. S-t-a-c-y;

23 Brown, B-r-o-w-n.

24 THE CLERK: Thank you.

25

26 DIRECT EXAMINATION

27 BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

28 Q. Good morning, Mr. Brown. 5564



1 A. Good morning.

2 Q. What is your occupation, sir?

3 A. I’m -- currently I’m an analyst for MS-NBC

4 and I’m also an author.

5 Q. All right. As an author, have you had

6 occasion to collaborate with writers in the creation

7 of books?

8 A. Oh, yes, several.

9 Q. Can you give me an example?

10 A. Well, in 2002, published by Simon &

11 Schuster, I co-authored the book Blind Faith, a

12 biography of Stevie Wonder and his mom, Lula

13 Hardaway.

14 Q. Have you worked in the past to --

15 collaborated in the past with any members of the

16 family of Michael Jackson in the creation of books?

17 A. Yes, I have.

18 Q. Who would that be?

19 A. That would be his older sister, Rebbie

20 Jackson, and his brother Jermaine Jackson.

21 Q. And when I say “Mr. Jackson,” is he the man

22 seated to my right with the long black hair?

23 A. Yes.

24 Q. Were those -- was there ever any attempt to

25 publish those two books that you just described?

26 A. The latter two, Rebbie and Jermaine?

27 Q. Yes.

28 A. That I -- there was -- 5565



1 Q. Were they published?

2 A. No, they was not published.

3 Q. Do you know why not?

4 A. Well, the last one with --

5 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; calls for

6 speculation.

7 THE COURT: Sustained.

8 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Were those books,

9 either of them, pulled from the publisher by you?

10 A. Yes.

11 Q. Why?

12 A. At the direction of --

13 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Relevance;

14 foundation.

15 THE COURT: Sustained.

16 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: May I ask foundation or

17 relevance, Your Honor?

18 THE COURT: The relevance.

19 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: All right.

20 Q. Mr. Brown, did you collaborate with Bob

21 Jones or are you collaborating with Bob Jones in the

22 writing of a book concerning his experiences as an

23 employee of Michael Jackson?

24 A. That’s correct.

25 Q. How long have you been doing that?

26 A. Since last summer.

27 Q. How did you meet Bob Jones?

28 A. I met Bob years ago. He was, of course, 5566



1 working for Michael. I was a reporter for the L.A.

2 Daily News at the time, and we were covering a story

3 about Michael’s -- the birth of Michael’s first

4 child. And I had talked about -- everyone had

5 talked about, everyone in the media, when they want

6 information or comments from Michael on things

7 that -- like having a baby.

8 Q. Who approached whom concerning the writing

9 of this book?

10 A. Last January during the arraignment here,

11 Bob Jones approached me -- we were both standing

12 outside that day, and he approached me about writing

13 that book.

14 Q. And you’ve worked together to prepare a

15 manuscript?

16 A. Yeah, we did. And we didn’t -- you know, I

17 didn’t initially agree to write the book.

18 Q. Okay.

19 A. There was some concerns that I had. I

20 didn’t want to --

21 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; nonresponsive.

22 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: That’s fine.

23 THE COURT: Sustained.

24 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: So did you originally

25 want to write this book?

26 A. Not originally, no.

27 Q. Why not?

28 A. Well, I knew -- 5567



1 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Relevance; calls

2 for speculation.

3 THE COURT: Sustained.

4 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: It goes to -- offered as

5 credibility.

6 THE COURT: The objection is sustained.

7 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Tell me about the

8 collaboration process with Mr. Jones. How has this

9 book come together?

10 A. Well, I interviewed Bob, another writer also

11 interviewed Bob as well, about his experience, not

12 only with Michael. We have to remember Bob worked

13 with a lot of people including Lionel Ritchie, Rick

14 James, Barry Gordy, the Jacksons as a family.

15 Q. Uh-huh.

16 A. So Michael was -- and Bob’s mind was seen as

17 just a small part of his story, but obviously the

18 publisher wanted more about Michael because he is

19 Michael.

20 Q. When you’re collaborating with an individual

21 in the preparation of a manuscript, are there -- is

22 there a dialogue with publishers to see what kind of

23 book the publisher will be interested in?

24 A. Oh, absolutely.

25 Q. And do you employ a literary agent to try --

26 A. Yes.

27 Q. -- and market the book?

28 A. Yes. And in this particular case, we 5568



1 employed quite a few.

2 Q. Why is that?

3 A. Well, Bob has problems trusting people.

4 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; relevance.

5 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I can withdraw that.

6 THE COURT: All right. I’ll strike his

7 answer. You can rephrase the question.

8 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: That’s fine.

9 Q. How many agents did you work with?

10 A. Gosh. It’s now -- five now.

11 Q. And you currently -- are you currently

12 employing an agent?

13 A. Yes, we are. We are currently employing

14 two.

15 Q. And what are their names?

16 A. Neil Gudovitz and Bill Gladstone.

17 Q. In working with Mr. Jones, how did you

18 communicate with one another?

19 A. We spoke a lot over the phone. We met in

20 person. And a lot of times, because of the

21 distance, we e-mailed each other.

22 Q. And so how would it work in terms of his

23 working with you?

24 A. What would happen is he would send me an

25 e-mail of a lot of his notes that he had kept over

26 the years. We would talk about them, and then I’d

27 start writing. And I would send him what I write,

28 and he would have to approve it, and then he would 5569



1 send it back with any type of changes that needed to

2 be made, and the changes would be -- then be made.

3 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: If I may approach, Your

4 Honor.

5 THE COURT: Yes.

6 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Mr. Jones -- or Mr.

7 Brown, I show you People’s Exhibit 803. Could you

8 identify those two passages for me?

9 MR. MESEREAU: Objection to the extent it

10 calls for hearsay.

11 THE COURT: Overruled. I’ll allow him to

12 identify them.

13 THE WITNESS: By “identify,” read them?

14 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: No, just identify them.

15 Are those two passages that came from the book that

16 you’re working on with Mr. Jones?

17 A. That’s correct, yes.

18 Q. And while I’m up here, I’m going to show you

19 People’s Exhibit 804. Can you identify that for me?

20 A. An e-mail Bob Jones sent to me.

21 Q. You personally received that from Mr. Jones?

22 A. That’s correct.

23 Q. And an e-mail --

24 A. That’s correct. Another e-mail.

25 Q. That’s Exhibit 805. That’s one he sent you

26 as well?

27 A. That’s correct.

28 Q. Now, for the record, are these complete 5570



1 e-mails or did they have some material?

2 A. Oh, they had a lot of material.

3 Q. But this is just a portion of them?

4 A. Yeah.

5 Q. All right. Did Bob Jones, during your

6 collaboration with him in the writing of this book,

7 tell you about an incident in which he observed the

8 defendant, Michael Jackson, lick a boy by the name

9 of Jordie Chandler on the head?

10 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Hearsay; and

11 leading.

12 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Offered under 1236.

13 THE COURT: The objection is overruled.

14 THE WITNESS: I’m sorry.

15 THE COURT: Just answer that “yes” or “no.”

16 THE WITNESS: Yeah. Yes, he did.

17 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: What did he tell you?

18 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; hearsay.

19 THE COURT: Overruled.

20 You may answer.

21 THE WITNESS: Well, he described an

22 incident, they were going to the World Music Awards

23 in Monaco, I believe it was. And he talked about

24 how strange it was, because Jordie had a head full

25 of hair, and he said, “I thought maybe it would be

26 more” -- you know, “It would be understandable if he

27 had a bald head.” But he just couldn’t understand

28 the licking of the head when he had a head full of 5571



1 hair.

2 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: He said he saw Michael

3 Jackson lick Jordie’s head?

4 A. Correct.

5 Q. Those two passages that I showed you in

6 Exhibit 803, did you ever share that manuscript that

7 contained those passages with Mr. Jones?

8 A. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Bob had to approve

9 everything that went to the publisher.

10 Q. So everything that went to the publisher was

11 approved by Mr. Jones?

12 A. That’s correct.

13 Q. And did this -- did those two passages that

14 I just showed you go to the publisher?

15 A. Oh, yeah.

16 Q. Did you discuss this issue of the licking

17 incident on more than one occasion?

18 A. Oh, yes, we did. Do you want me to --

19 Q. Go ahead.

20 A. Yeah, we did. Beginning in, I would say,

21 maybe August or September, he and I discussed it.

22 And we discussed it with another writer, Dennis

23 love, and also our agent and the publisher.

24 Q. Okay. You previously mentioned Neil

25 Gudovitz and Bill Gladstone. Was it discussed with

26 those two gentlemen?

27 A. Yes.

28 Q. And your publisher, who would that be? 5572



1 A. That would be Select Books.

2 Q. Okay. Specifically who was this issue

3 discussed with?

4 A. Well, it was discussed not only with --

5 well, specifically at Select Books?

6 Q. Yes. And I mean by Mr. Jones himself.

7 A. We had -- well, I don’t know that Bob

8 discussed it with Select. But we discussed it with

9 Simon & Schuster and Harper Collins in a conference

10 call that we had. Bob discussed it with them. They

11 discussed the entire -- the entire proposal that we

12 put before them, and that included that.

13 Q. All right. This e-mail that I showed you,

14 804 - I’ll show it to you again just so you’re

15 familiar with what I’m talking about - references

16 that, “The licking is going to be important because

17 he did it in this case, too.”

18 Can you tell me, what was the context of

19 that remark?

20 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Relevance;

21 foundation; and calls for hearsay.

22 THE COURT: Sustained.

23 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: What did you understand

24 he was referring to when he said, “this case, too”?

25 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Foundation;

26 relevance.

27 THE COURT: Overruled.

28 Excuse me. Sustained. 5573



1 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Did you stay abreast of

2 the information in the media during the writing of

3 this book?

4 A. Yeah, I had to. It’s my job.

5 Q. Okay. Did you -- did you check the Internet

6 sources of news media?

7 A. Yeah. I look at different newspapers and

8 news outlets throughout the country, and their take

9 on what’s going on as well.

10 Q. And on October 30th, 2004, had you ever

11 heard of any kind of licking that had gone on in the

12 case of People v. Michael Jackson that’s presently

13 before the Court?

14 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Relevance;

15 foundation; hearsay.

16 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: In the media outlets.

17 MR. MESEREAU: Improper hearsay.

18 THE COURT: I guess I’m not sure where you’re

19 going with what his knowledge is of this case, how

20 that relates to what Mr. Jones has said.

21 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Whether it had been

22 reported in the media from another source - he says

23 he kept abreast of all the media sources - or

24 whether this was the first time he’d heard it.

25 THE COURT: All right. If you’ll rephrase

26 the question to relate to the relevance that you’re

27 describing.

28 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Okay. 5574



1 Q. My question is this, Mr. Brown: When Mr.

2 Jones wrote you this e-mail on October 30th, were

3 you aware at that time that there was an allegation

4 of licking in the case involving Gavin Arvizo and

5 Mr. Jackson?

6 A. I can’t say that --

7 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; foundation.

8 THE COURT: The objection is overruled.

9 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: All right. Go ahead.

10 A. I can’t say that I was, because I -- when

11 Bob told me, it was the first that I’d heard of the

12 incident. He had actually heard it first as it

13 pertains to this case, and that’s when -- that

14 prompted him to share with me that it was going to

15 be important.

16 Q. Now, he says in that e-mail, “The licking is

17 going to be important because he did it in this

18 case, too.” Was that the first time you heard of

19 the connection between the two --

20 A. Yes.

21 Q. -- cases?

22 Had he talked to you about the licking

23 before that?

24 A. We had started discussing --

25 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Relevance;

26 foundation; hearsay.

27 THE COURT: I’ll overrule the objection.

28 But the question is simply whether or not he 5575



1 discussed this with you before that e-mail.

2 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: So that’s a “yes” or

3 “no.”

4 A. That particular e-mail?

5 Q. Yeah, before that e-mail.

6 A. The e-mail, no. The incident, yeah.

7 Q. Okay, the incident. He discussed it before

8 that e-mail?

9 A. Yeah.

10 Q. Has Mr. Jones ever indicated to you a fear

11 of testifying in this case?

12 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Foundation;

13 relevance; calls for speculation; move to strike.

14 THE COURT: Sustained. The objection is

15 sustained. Stricken.

16 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Was there a period of

17 time when Mr. Jones all of a sudden began to have a

18 loss of recollection or something of that nature

19 regarding this licking incident?

20 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Leading; calls

21 for speculation.

22 THE COURT: I’ll sustain the objection as the

23 question is too broad.

24 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Okay. At some time

25 during your collaboration with Mr. Jones, did he

26 ever try to deny his recollections about this

27 licking incident?

28 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Leading; calls 5576



1 for speculation; relevance; foundation.

2 THE COURT: I’ll overrule the objection. The

3 question should be read back to the witness.

4 (Record read.)

5 THE WITNESS: Yeah. He had fuzzy

6 recollections about it, yes.

7 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Was there --

8 THE COURT: Just a moment. We’re going to

9 take our break.

1 THE COURT: All right. Go ahead.

2 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Thank you, Your Honor.

3 Q. Mr. Brown, where we left off, I was asking

4 you about this period of time when Mr. Jones started

5 to have some failure of recollection on the issue of

6 head licking.

7 When did that -- do you recall when that

8 began or when that started?

9 A. It’s been about a month or so now.

10 Q. Before that time, how many times had you

11 been involved in a conversation where Mr. Jones

12 talked about the head-licking incident?

13 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; relevance.

14 THE COURT: Overruled.

15 THE WITNESS: I can’t tell you exact number

16 of times, but it was more than a couple.

17 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Okay. And how would

18 you describe this change in his recollection, if you

19 can?

20 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; vague.

21 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I can be more specific.

22 MR. MESEREAU: Relevance.

23 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: My question goes to,

24 was it an abrupt change, or was it something that

25 occurred over a period of time, or something in

26 between?

27 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Vague; relevance;

28 foundation. 5582



1 THE COURT: Overruled.

2 You may answer.

3 THE WITNESS: I would say it was more abrupt

4 than anything else.

5 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Thank you, Mr. Brown. I

6 have no further questions.

7 THE COURT: Cross-examine?

8 MR. MESEREAU: Yes, please, Your Honor.

9

10 CROSS-EXAMINATION

11 BY MR. MESEREAU:

12 Q. Good morning, Mr. Brown.

13 A. Good morning.

14 Q. How long have you known Bob Jones?

15 A. The year Princess Diana died. I think it

16 was ‘97.

17 Q. Okay. And approximately when did he tell

18 you he intended to write a book?

19 A. It was about January, a few months before he

20 was terminated.

21 Q. And you’ve been interviewed by the sheriffs

22 in this case, right?

23 A. That’s correct.

24 Q. And you told the sheriffs that Bob Jones

25 told you he’s broke and he needs to make some money,

26 right?

27 A. That’s what --

28 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection; hearsay. 5583



1 THE COURT: Sustained.

2 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Have you gone through

3 different drafts with Mr. Jones?

4 A. Yes, I have.

5 Q. On the issue of head licking, did Mr. Jones

6 tell you at one point he had to make money on this

7 book because he had financial problems?

8 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection. Hearsay;

9 argumentative.

10 THE COURT: Overruled.

11 You may answer.

12 THE WITNESS: He didn’t -- Mr. Mesereau, he

13 didn’t tell me that in relation to the head licking.

14 That never came up in discussions of money.

15 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: But he told you he’s broke

16 and has to get paid for this book, correct?

17 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection. Hearsay;

18 argumentative.

19 THE COURT: Overruled.

20 You may answer.

21 THE WITNESS: When we first started the book,

22 he said he needs the money. He was just fired.

23 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: And he said he was broke,

24 right?

25 A. Yes. That’s correct.

26 Q. You told the police you said he was broke,

27 right?

28 A. That’s correct. 5584



1 Q. Okay. Now, how did -- how did the -- let me

2 rephrase that.

3 Obviously at some point you met with Bob

4 Jones about writing a book, correct?

5 A. That’s correct.

6 Q. And where did you meet with him?

7 A. Well, as I said earlier, he first approached

8 me here at the court, back during the arraignment.

9 Q. And did he tell you then he wanted to write

10 something?

11 A. That’s correct.

12 Q. And that’s before he --

13 A. That’s before his termination.

14 Q. Okay. And how long before his termination

15 was that, do you think?

16 A. Well, it was January, so -- the termination

17 was in June. So four, five months.

18 Q. And did he tell you he was doing it

19 secretly?

20 A. Well, he didn’t say secretly, but he said --

21 obviously any process with a book, you don’t want

22 everyone to know this is what you are doing.

23 I did, however, myself, tell members of the

24 family, to get their thoughts on it, because that

25 was my concern, what their thoughts may be with me

26 doing a book with Bob Jones with -- chiefly it had

27 to be about Michael Jackson.

28 Q. Okay. Now, did Mr. Jones tell you he was 5585



1 talking to anyone from the sheriff’s department?

2 A. Not at that time, no.

3 Q. When did you first learn that he had spoken

4 to anyone from the sheriff’s department?

5 A. I believe they first contacted him in

6 December of last year.

7 Q. And based on the prosecutor’s questions to

8 you, you must have learned at some point that Bob

9 Jones was saying he couldn’t really remember seeing

10 any head licking, right?

11 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection; hearsay.

12 THE COURT: I’m sorry, I can’t read the --

13 THE REPORTER: “Learned” instead of

14 “render.”

15 THE COURT: All right. The objection is

16 Overruled.

17 You may answer.

18 THE WITNESS: Could you repeat it, sir?

19 MR. MESEREAU: I’ll have it read back. May

20 it be read back, Your Honor?

21 THE COURT: Yes.

22 (Record read.)

23 THE WITNESS: Oh, I wouldn’t say it was

24 based on the prosecutor’s -- that. I think it was

25 simply when I spoke with him, he got a little

26 nervous about that particular vein. I think he

27 realized that it was going to become a part of this

28 -- 5586



1 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Well, did you and Mr.

2 Jones discuss the fact that the Arvizos went to

3 Larry Feldman, the same lawyer who represented the

4 Chandlers?

5 A. The --

6 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection. Relevance;

7 beyond the scope; and argumentative.

8 THE COURT: Sustained.

9 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Has the name Larry Feldman

10 come up in the book you’re writing?

11 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Same objection.

12 THE COURT: Overruled.

13 You may answer.

14 THE WITNESS: Not by name, but certainly by

15 title and by inference. Bob did say, based on his

16 notes back in --

17 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Well, just -- you just

18 have to answer the question, okay? I’ll get into

19 that --

20 A. Okay.

21 Q. -- okay?

22 Does the book concern this case in any

23 respect?

24 A. I would think in some respects.

25 Q. And is it your plan to market the book while

26 this trial is going on?

27 A. Well, it all depends on when it’s finished.

28 Q. Has he ever talked to you about when he 5587



1 plans to complete the book?

2 A. Well, I have a lot of say in that, so we’ve

3 talked about that, and we’ve always said we don’t

4 want it to be a rush job, and a lot of people want

5 it to be a rush job. The publisher wants it to be a

6 rush job.

7 Q. The publisher wants it to be a rough job --

8 A. Rush job.

9 Q. -- rush job because you can sell it better

10 while the trial is going on, right?

11 A. Obviously, if it comes out now, it would

12 probably pique some interest because it’s Bob Jones,

13 who, you know, has worked for Michael for so long,

14 and it’s Michael.

15 Q. Now, have you discussed the amount of money

16 he might make on the book?

17 A. No, you know, we -- we’ve been made promises

18 in the past. We don’t listen to that. We don’t

19 even speculate on what can be made.

20 Personally, I just enjoy writing, so, you

21 know, the money aspect -- I think I do pretty well.

22 It’s not a big deal to me.

23 Q. Do you remember you were interviewed by a

24 Santa Barbara sheriff on December 7th, 2004?

25 A. Around about, yeah.

26 Q. And you were approached by Sergeant Robel,

27 right?

28 A. Uh-huh. Yes, that’s correct. I’m sorry. 5588



1 Q. And the purpose of the interview was to talk

2 to you about this alleged head-licking event, right?

3 A. I’m not sure if that was the purpose of the

4 interview. We talked about various things back in

5 December, but I’m not sure that was the purpose of

6 it.

7 Q. And do you remember Sergeant Robel wanted to

8 know why you had said that Mr. Jones told you he saw

9 Michael Jackson kiss Jordie, not lick his head?

10 A. Well, that’s not exactly what -- that I

11 remember Sergeant Robel putting to me. There was a

12 question another investigator had had about whether

13 I said he -- Bob said he licked or kissed him, and

14 he wanted me to clarify that.

15 Q. And you had told the investigator that based

16 on your discussions with Bob Jones, he had said that

17 Michael Jackson kissed Jordie one time, didn’t lick

18 his head, right?

19 A. No, I didn’t say that.

20 Q. Do you remember you apologized?

21 A. No, no. What happened -- I apologized if it

22 was confused. But what happened was, I think the

23 investigator had misunderstood and that’s what he

24 was calling to clarify. That’s one of the reasons

25 why he called, to clarify exactly what I said. He

26 said he didn’t remember if I said “licking” or

27 “kissing.”

28 Q. Let me ask you if this is correct. 5589



1 A. Sure.

2 Q. “Brown apologized for the mistake. Said he

3 had not realized that he told me he was kissing as

4 opposed to licking.” Does that sound accurate to

5 you?

6 A. It’s probably accurate. But again, as I’m

7 explaining to you, I explained to Sergeant Robel

8 when he asked the question, when he asked me about

9 that, I had told the other investigator, I think it

10 was Zelis, I’m -- I’m not sure, but I think it was

11 Paul Zelis, the investigator’s name, and I think he

12 was the one who had actually made the mistake or --

13 I won’t even say “mistake.” He wanted to clarify,

14 is that what I said.

15 Q. Why did you apologize to him?

16 A. Well, I apologized for being polite. I

17 mean, it’s just a polite thing to do, you know. If

18 I was wrong, I have no problems apologizing.

19 Q. Now, you’re aware that Mr. Jones has

20 indicated he doesn’t remember head licking and has

21 said he’d be lying to say that he did. Are you

22 aware of that?

23 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection; misstates the

24 evidence.

25 THE COURT: Sustained.

26 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: You’re in the process of

27 writing the section of the book that deals with this

28 trip to Monaco, aren’t you? 5590



1 A. No. No, we’re long since past that.

2 Q. Well, Mr. Jones has indicated that he has

3 not approved --

4 A. Everything that has --

5 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection. Argumentative;

6 hearsay as to what Mr. Jones said; and misstates the

7 evidence.

8 THE COURT: It’s an incomplete question, too.

9 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Mr. Jones has final

10 approval over what’s in that book, doesn’t he?

11 A. Absolutely.

12 Q. Would you agree that the more sensational

13 the book, the better the chance of making money on

14 it?

15 A. Well, obviously. I mean, we’ve been told

16 things that nothing surprises them about Michael

17 Jackson, so -- but it’s not our intentions to write

18 a book of scandal, if that’s what you’re inferring.

19 It’s certainly not mine, and I have to write it.

20 And I have people in his family who I happen to love

21 very much who I’m not going to disappoint.

22 Q. They’re not getting any money from the book,

23 are they?

24 A. The family?

25 Q. Yes.

26 A. Why should they?

27 Q. They’re not getting any money from the book,

28 are they? 5591



1 A. I’m sorry to respond in that way. No.

2 Q. The one who is going to make money is Bob

3 Jones, who’s broke, right?

4 A. We both will.

5 Q. You’re aware that Bob Jones was very upset

6 when he was terminated, aren’t you?

7 A. You know what? To be honest with you, he

8 wasn’t upset that he was terminated. He was upset

9 in which the way Randy terminated him.

10 Q. I’m not sure what that means.

11 A. Well, Bob had --

12 Q. Referring to Randy Jackson, right?

13 A. Randy Jackson, I’m sorry.

14 Bob had felt he’d been loyal to Michael for

15 basically half of Michael’s life, or most of

16 Michael’s life, I should say. And to get fired by a

17 messenger, you know, I felt bad, too. In fact, I

18 had spoke to someone in Michael’s family about that.

19 I said, “That’s horrible.”

20 But he was just upset in the method. He

21 knew that eventually his time was going to be up

22 just like everyone else’s.

23 Q. In the draft that you and Mr. Jones have

24 written, Mr. Jones says on at least two occasions

25 that he’s never seen Michael Jackson act

26 inappropriately with children, right?

27 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection; hearsay.

28 THE COURT: Overruled. 5592



1 You may answer.

2 THE WITNESS: Well, if it was the exact --

3 well, I don’t remember the exact wording, but to say

4 that he saw him molest anybody, no, it does not say

5 he saw him molest anybody.

6 MR. MESEREAU: I have no further questions,

7 Your Honor.

9 REDIRECT EXAMINATION

10 BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

11 Q. Mr. Jones (sic), I previously showed you

12 People’s Exhibit 803. Did Mr. Jones approve those

13 two passages?

14 A. Yes.

15 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Ask to move 803 into

16 evidence.

17 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Hearsay;

18 foundation.

19 THE COURT: Sustained.

20 MR. MESEREAU: Relevance.

21 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Offered as a prior

22 inconsistent statement as to the first passage and a

23 prior consistent statement as to the second.

24 MR. MESEREAU: Same objection.

25 THE COURT: The ruling remains the same.

26 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: All right. Ask at this

27 time to admit the two e-mails, Your Honor, Exhibits

28 804 and 805, into evidence at this time. 5593



1 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Hearsay;

2 foundation; authenticity; relevance.

3 THE COURT: I’ll take that up later.

4 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Okay.

5 Q. Mr. Brown, you said that Mr. Jones was

6 complaining about his finances on cross-examination.

7 A. Uh-huh. Yes.

8 Q. Is this a frequent complaint?

9 A. Yeah, he’s -- well, yeah, he’s made a few

10 complaints about that.

11 Q. Was there a time when he stopped complaining

12 about his finances during this period of

13 collaboration?

14 A. Yes.

15 Q. Was what -- when -- when he stopped

16 complaining about finances, tell me, was there any

17 relationship in time to that point and the time in

18 which he started to have this failure of

19 recollection?

20 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Relevance; vague;

21 foundation.

22 THE COURT: I’ll sustain vague.

23 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Can you tell me

24 approximately when in time Mr. Jones stopped

25 complaining about his finances?

26 A. It’s been about a month or so.

27 Q. And when in time did he start to have his

28 failure of recollection? 5594



1 A. About a month or so.

2 Q. Did they -- did both of those coincide in

3 time?

4 A. I would say so, yes.

5 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Thank you. I have no

6 further questions.

7

8 RECROSS-EXAMINATION

9 BY MR. MESEREAU:

10 Q. Mr. Brown, what I think the prosecutor just

11 elicited is the following: When he was broke, he

12 said there was licking. And when he didn’t have

13 financial problems, he said there wasn’t any, right?

14 A. Well, if that’s how you --

15 Q. Right?

16 A. -- break it down, yeah, I guess.

17 MR. MESEREAU: Thank you.

18 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: No further questions.

19 THE COURT: Thank you. You may step down.

20 Would you give me Exhibits 804 and 805?

21 Call your next witness.

22 MR. SNEDDON: June Chandler, Your Honor.

23 THE BAILIFF: She’s on her way, Your Honor.

24 THE COURT: 804 and 805 are not admitted.

25 Come forward, please. When you get to the

26 witness stand here, remain standing.

19 A. As best as I can recall, seven and four.

20 Q. And who is the oldest?

21 A. Nicky Chandler, the son.

22 Q. Okay. Now, I want to show you some

23 photographs. The first photograph we have that’s

24 marked is 793, the next one is 794, and the next one

25 is 795, okay?

26 The first one, 793, I’ll ask you if you

27 recognize the person depicted in that photograph?

28 A. No, I do not. 5598



1 Q. Have you ever seen that person before?

2 A. Not that I recall.

3 Q. And I want to show you a photograph marked

4 as 794, or Exhibit 794. Do you recognize the people

5 depicted in that photograph?

6 A. Not that I recall.

11 Q. And with regard to Exhibit No. 795, do you

12 recognize any of the people depicted in that

13 photograph?

14 A. I recall this boy and Michael Jackson.

15 Q. All right. “This boy” meaning the person on

16 the far left-hand side of the Exhibit 795?

17 A. Correct.

18 Q. And do you recall the boy’s name?

19 A. Brett Barnes.

20 Q. Do you recall where you saw Mr. Barnes, or

21 the child Barnes?

22 A. At Neverland.

23 Q. Okay. So with regard to the Photographs

24 793, 794 and 795, none of those photographs are

25 pictures of your son, correct?

26 A. No. No.

27 Q. I want to show you 776; ask you if you

28 recognize that photograph? 5599



1 A. Yes, I do.

2 Q. And who is that?

3 A. That’s my son.

4 Q. Your son?

5 A. Jordan.

6 Q. All right. Thank you.

7 Your Honor, with the Court’s permission, I’d

8 like to publish these just so the jury knows what

9 the witness has testified to.

10 THE COURT: Yes.

11 MR. SNEDDON: And we’re going to do it on

12 the Elmo, Your Honor. So if we could have that.

13 All right, Gordon?

14 Q. All right. The photograph that’s on the

15 board that’s 793 is an exhibit of the child with the

16 long black hair. And that is not your son, Jordan

17 Chandler?

18 A. No, it’s not.

19 Q. All right. And the next exhibit would be

20 794. And specifically I’m going to direct your

21 attention to the child sitting on the floor with the

22 arrow drawn up to him. Do you recognize that child?

23 A. Barely.

24 Q. Who do you think that -- when you say

25 “barely,” who do you recognize --

26 A. I would say it’s probably a younger photo of

27 the boy above.

28 Q. And do you recognize who the boy above in 5600



1 that photograph is?

2 A. I think that’s Brett Barnes.

3 Q. Okay. And the last photo is 795. And you

4 indicated the child on the far left-hand side of the

5 photograph; is that correct?

6 A. Correct.

7 Q. The child with the hat next to Mr. Jackson?

8 A. Correct. That’s Brett Barnes.

9 Q. That’s Brett Barnes. All right. Thank you.

10 And lastly, the photograph marked as 776,

11 you’ve identified that as your child, Jordan,

12 correct?

13 A. My son Jordan.

14 Q. Your son Jordan?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. All right. Thank you.

17 We can have the lights again, Your Honor.

18 Now, Mrs. Chandler, do you recognize the

19 defendant in this case, Michael Jackson?

20 A. I do.

21 Q. And have you been in Mr. Jackson’s presence

22 before?

23 A. Yes.

24 Q. Now, your son Jordan, did you have -- let me

25 go back in time. Did you have an occasion where you

26 actually met Michael Jackson?

27 A. Yes, I had an occasion.

28 Q. For the first time? 5601



1 A. Yes.

2 Q. Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of

3 the jury, where did that occur?

4 A. That occurred at my ex-husband’s employment,

5 Rent-A-Wreck.

6 Q. And where is that located?

7 A. In West L.A.

8 Q. And was -- do you remember about

9 approximately when that occurred?

10 A. It was in the summer of ‘92. Late summer.

11 Q. And were you actually at the -- your

12 husband’s place of business when Mr. Jackson showed

13 up?

14 A. After he showed up, yes.

15 Q. Okay. You received a telephone call from

16 someone?

17 A. Yes, from my ex-husband.

18 Q. And by the way, your ex-husband’s name is

19 what?

20 A. David Schwartz.

21 Q. Did you ever take Mr. Schwartz’s last name?

22 A. No, I did not.

23 Q. So you’ve always been June Chandler?

24 A. I’ve always been June Chandler.

25 Q. So you received a telephone call and then

26 you went down to his place of business?

27 A. Yes, I did.

28 Q. With regard to your son Jordan, did Jordan 5602



1 go with you?

2 A. Yes, he did.

3 Q. Was Mr. Jackson there?

4 A. Yes, he was.

5 Q. And do you recall how long you were with Mr.

6 Jackson and Jordan that day?

7 A. Briefly. Five minutes. Ten minutes.

8 Q. And did -- was there any information

9 exchanged between you and Mr. Jackson that day?

10 A. Yes.

11 Q. And what was that?

12 A. I said, “If you would like to see Jordie or

13 if he could call you or if you’d like to speak to

14 him, here is our number, and you can give him a

15 call.”

16 Q. And you gave that to Mr. Jackson?

17 A. Yes, I did.

18 Q. Now, let me go back in time. Before this

19 meeting that you had at your husband’s place of

20 business in 1992, had Jordan ever expressed, to your

21 knowledge, some admiration for Mr. Jackson?

22 A. Oh, very much so, yes.

23 Q. How did he display that admiration?

24 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; hearsay.

25 MR. SNEDDON: I didn’t ask for a statement,

26 Your Honor. I asked for a display.

27 THE COURT: All right.

28 He’s not asking for anything that was said. 5603



1 Do you understand the question?

2 THE WITNESS: Would you repeat the question,

3 please?

4 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Yes.

5 How did your son Jordan, prior to this

6 meeting that occurred at David Schwartz’s place of

7 business, express -- display his admiration for Mr.

8 Jackson?

9 A. He had a little sparkly jacket that he would

10 wear to parties. He would have a glove like Michael

11 Jackson, and dance around like Michael Jackson.

12 Q. And this was all before he met Mr. Jackson?

13 A. Before he met Michael Jackson, yes.

14 Q. Now, after the incident occurred where there

15 was an exchange where you gave Mr. Jackson your

16 telephone number -- and let me go back and ask you a

17 question about that. Was the telephone number you

18 gave him your home number?

19 A. Yes, it was.

20 Q. Did -- to your knowledge, did Mr. Jackson

21 ever call your son Jordan?

22 A. Yes, he did.

23 Q. And do you recall, for the ladies and

24 gentlemen of the jury, approximately what the time

25 span was from the incident that occurred at your

26 ex-husband’s place of business to the time that Mr.

27 Jackson actually called your son?

28 A. To the best of my recollection, it could 5604



1 have been a month or two after our first meeting

2 with Michael Jackson at Rent-A-Wreck.

3 Q. Were you actually in the room when Mr.

4 Jackson called?

5 A. I don’t recall being in the room, but I

6 might have been.

7 Q. Do you recall at some time visiting

8 Neverland Ranch?

9 A. Yes, I do.

10 Q. Do you recall approximately when that

11 occurred?

12 A. I recall around February.

13 Q. Of?

14 A. 1993.

15 Q. 1993?

16 A. Yes.

17 Q. So what I want to ask you is, between the

18 time that Mr. Jackson started calling your son to

19 the time that you went to Neverland Ranch, can you

20 give the jury some idea of the number of times Mr.

21 Jackson called your son Jordan?

22 A. To the best of my recollection --

23 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; foundation.

24 THE COURT: Sustained.

25 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Were you present in the

26 house when these conversations occurred?

27 A. Yes, I was.

28 Q. Did you sometimes answer the phone? 5605



1 A. Yes.

2 Q. And Mr. Jackson was on the line?

3 A. Yes, he was.

4 Q. And were you also present in the house

5 during the time to observe the length of the

6 conversations between your son and Mr. Jackson?

7 A. Yes, I was.

8 Q. On more than one occasion?

9 A. Absolutely.

10 Q. All right. So based upon your observations

11 and the things that you saw and the things that you

12 heard, give us an estimate of the number of times,

13 that you know of, that Mr. Jackson called your son

14 Jordan.

15 A. I would say eight to ten times.

16 Q. And with regard to those conversations in

17 which you have personal knowledge of the length of

18 time, could you give the jury some idea of how long

8 “Would you like to come to visit? When I am

9 finished touring,” he was doing a European tour, I

10 think, he said we can come and visit. And my son

20 Q. And at this point in time, how old was Lily?

21 A. Was seven, I think. Seven or eight.

6 Michael were playing video games. I was watching.

7 Lily was playing. We looked at his animals that he

17 Q. And could you tell us about that?

18 A. I guess it was after hours, after Toys-R-Us

10 with him?

15 strike.

16 THE COURT: Sustained. Stricken.

17 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: As a result of the

18 conversation that you had with your son Jordan, did

19 he eventually call his father?

20 A. I think he did, yes.

21 Q. All right. At some point in time, did you

22 receive a message of some sort from your ex-husband

23 Evan about Mr. Jackson?

24 A. Yes.

25 Q. And don’t tell us what was said, okay? I

26 just want to get the facts and the background to it.

27 Where were you when you first heard the message?

15 message for Mr. Jackson?

16 A. I don’t recall.

17 Q. Are you familiar with a person by the name

18 of Anthony Pellicano?

23 Q. And was Mr. Pellicano introduced to you by

24 somebody?

25 A. By Bert Fields and Michael Jackson.

26 Q. In relationship to this voice message that

27 you received on your message machine at your house,

28 do you recall how many days after that particular 5644



1 message, you received that message, that you were

2 introduced to Mr. Pellicano and Mr. Fields by Mr.

3 Jackson?

4 A. It could be a week later.

9 Pellicano through the defendant, Michael Jackson?

21 had been left on your message machine by your

22 ex-husband Evan Chandler?

23 A. Yes, sir.

24 Q. Now, did the defendant, Michael Jackson,

25 tell you who Anthony Pellicano was?

26 A. Yes, he did.

27 Q. What did he say about Mr. Pellicano?

28 A. “He can find out anything. He’s really good 5645



1 at this. He’s really good at investigating. If

2 you’re having a problem, he’ll get to the bottom of

3 it.”

5 know him by name. What occupation is he?

1 Q. At that particular location, was your son

2 Jordan Chandler there, can you tell us?

3 A. Yes, he might have been there, too.

4 Q. Do you recall whether or not or do you

5 recall an incident -- doesn’t have to be on that

6 particular occasion, but do you recall an occasion

7 whether or not your son Jordan Chandler was ever

8 interviewed by Anthony Pellicano?

26 Q. And were you -- were you presented with some

27 papers to sign?

28 A. Yes, I was. 5647



1 Q. And those papers did what?

2 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Hearsay;

3 foundation; relevance.

4 THE COURT: Foundation; sustained.

5 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: The papers were presented

6 to you by whom?

7 A. By Pellicano.

8 Q. And was Mr. Fields present?

1 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Leading; hearsay;

2 move to strike.

3 MR. SNEDDON: It’s foundational, or to

4 refresh her recollection.

5 THE COURT: If you want to refresh her

6 recollection with something, you can approach her

7 and show the item.

8 MR. SNEDDON: All right. Counsel, page 95,

9 lines 15 to 19.

10 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Foundation, Your

11 Honor.

12 THE COURT: You have to ask her if it will

13 help refresh her recollection, or it might.

14 MR. SNEDDON: Can I show it to her first?

15 That’s the way counsel’s been doing it.

16 MR. MESEREAU: No, I haven’t at all.

17 THE COURT: Actually, he’s been asking them

18 if it would refresh their recollection if he showed

19 them something.

20 MR. SNEDDON: All right.

21 Q. Do you recall that conversation?

22 A. Yes, I do.

23 Q. And -- and it occurred at a point in time

24 when things were a lot fresher in your mind than

25 they are now?

26 A. Yes.

27 Q. Would it help, perhaps, if you looked at the

28 statement, that it might help refresh your 5649



1 recollection?

2 A. Yes.

3 MR. SNEDDON: May I approach the witness,

4 Your Honor?

5 THE COURT: Yes.

6 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Just read it to yourself.

7 Start here and right down to here. How’s that?

8 Counsel, I’m having her read lines 11 to

9 line 25.

10 MR. MESEREAU: I’m going to object to that.

11 That’s improper refreshing of recollection and it’s

12 hearsay, foundational, to have her just read it.

13 MR. SNEDDON: That’s all I’m asking her to

14 do. I’m just trying to help you try to find out

15 where it is.

16 THE COURT: All right. Just let her look at

17 it. Counsel knows you can refresh a person’s

18 recollection with anything.

19 MR. MESEREAU: Your Honor, I thought she was

20 reading it out loud. That was my mistake. I

21 withdraw the objection.

22 THE COURT: That would have been improper.

23 MR. SNEDDON: We’ve been down that road

24 before.

25 THE COURT: All right, I’m sorry. Did we --

26 where are we?

27 (Laughter.)

28 MR. SNEDDON: I know where we are. 5650



1 THE COURT: Is it break time yet? No.

2 (Laughter.)

3 MR. SNEDDON: I’m sorry, Judge. You’re

4 going to have to suffer for six more minutes and

5 you’re not getting out of here a minute early.

6 Payback is you-know-what.

7 Q. All right. Mrs. Chandler, with regard to

8 whether or not the defendant was present, did that

9 refresh your recollection?

10 A. Yes, it does.

11 Q. And do you recall whether the defendant was

12 present?

13 A. He was present.

14 Q. And does it refresh -- did the defendant,

15 Michael Jackson, make statements to you with regard

16 to the particular documents that you were being

17 asked to sign?

18 A. Yes, he did.

19 Q. And do you recall what he told you?

20 A. He was frantic. He was begging me to, “Come

21 over and sign this so there won’t be any lawsuits or

22 anything. Just sign it, sign it.”

23 Q. And, in effect, what you signed did what to

24 you personally?

25 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Hearsay;

26 foundation.

27 MR. SNEDDON: Let me go back, Judge. I

28 think I can correct this. 5651



1 Q. I am assuming you read the document before

2 you signed it?

3 A. Briefly.

4 Q. And you understood what it meant when you

5 were signing it?

6 A. Not really.

7 Q. Okay. You understood -- well, let me ask

8 you this: Did you understand -- if you didn’t

9 understand all of it, you understood some of it,

10 correct?

11 A. Yes, I did.

12 Q. Did you understand a part of it that had to

13 do with who was going to have custody for the

14 children temporarily?

15 A. Exactly, yes.

16 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; leading.

17 THE COURT: Overruled.

18 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: I’m sorry?

19 A. Yes.

20 Q. And it wasn’t going to be you anymore?

21 A. Exactly.

22 Q. Did you sign that paper?

23 A. I did.

24 Q. Mrs. Chandler, I neglected to ask you about

25 one other incident that occurred at Neverland Ranch,

26 okay?

27 A. Yes.

28 Q. So pardon me if we can go back in time from 5652



1 where we are presently. And then we’re almost done,

2 okay?

3 A. Okay.

4 Q. Do you recall whether there was ever any

5 occasion where your brother and your sister-in-law

24 A. Before eight o’clock.

25 Q. Eight o’clock --

26 A. P.m.

27 Q. P.m. Now, do you recall seeing Mr. Jackson

28 and Jordan before you left? 5653



1 A. Yes.

2 Q. And where did you see them?

3 A. They were in Michael Jackson’s bedroom.

4 Q. And do you recall -- did you go into the

5 bedroom?

6 A. Yes.

7 Q. Did you go in there with your brother and

8 sister-in-law?

9 A. Yes, we did.

10 Q. And when you went into the bedroom, where

11 was Mr. Jackson?

19 A. On the bed, too.

20 Q. Now, at some point in time, Mrs. Chandler,

21 your son Jordan Chandler was involved in a lawsuit,

22 Chandler versus Jackson, a civil lawsuit. Do you

23 recall that?

24 A. Yes, I do.

25 Q. And were you a participant in that lawsuit

26 as a representative of your son?

27 A. Yes, I was.

28 Q. And who was the lawyer who represented your 5654



1 son during the majority of that litigation?

2 A. Larry Feldman.

3 Q. And to your knowledge, was a lawsuit filed

4 on behalf of your son against the defendant, Michael

5 Jackson?

6 A. Yes.

7 Q. And did you assist or help Mr. Feldman in

8 the preparation of that lawsuit?

9 A. Yes.

10 Q. And did you support your son during that

11 lawsuit?

12 A. I did.

13 Q. Now, as a result of the lawsuit, did your

26 THE COURT: All right. Overruled.

27 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: You did not?

28 A. No. 5655



1 Q. And where did the idea for you receiving

3 MR. MESEREAU: Objection, to the extent it

4 calls for hearsay.

5 THE COURT: Sustained.

20 a couple of questions.

21 I want to go back to something we talked

22 about before. You told the jury that the defendant,

7 A. Correct.

8 Q. In exchange for that, you were given some

9 money?

13 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; hearsay.

14 THE COURT: Sustained.

15 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: What did you give up in

16 return for receiving money?

17 MR. MESEREAU: Same objection. Hearsay and

18 foundation.

21 A. No.

22 MR. SNEDDON: Nothing further.

23 THE COURT: Cross-examine?

24 MR. MESEREAU: Yes, please, Your Honor.

25

26 CROSS-EXAMINATION

27 BY MR. MESEREAU:

28 Q. Mrs. Chandler, my name is Tom Mesereau and I 5658



1 speak for Michael Jackson, okay?

2 A. Yes.

3 Q. If anything I ask you is not clear, please

4 don’t answer. Just say you don’t understand it, and

5 I’ll try to rephrase it, okay?

6 A. Okay.

7 Q. Now, in response to the prosecutor’s

8 questions, you said you entered into a stipulation

9 regarding custody of your son Jordie, correct?

10 A. Correct.

11 Q. And in response to the prosecutor’s

12 questions, you said you did it because Michael

13 Jackson told you to do it, right?

14 A. One of the people. He was one.

15 Q. Well, do you remember signing a sworn

16 declaration regarding that stipulation?

17 A. I remember signing something about custody

18 of Jordie.

19 Q. Do you remember signing a sworn declaration

20 in which you said the only reason you signed the

21 stipulation was because your ex-husband wouldn’t

22 return Jordie to you if you didn’t, right?

23 A. Correct.

24 Q. And you said further, you thought the

25 stipulation was merely for a one-week visitation

26 period, right?

27 A. Correct.

28 Q. Nowhere in that declaration did you say 5659



1 anything about Michael Jackson telling you to sign

2 anything, right?

3 A. That’s not correct.

4 Q. Would it refresh your recollection to look

5 at your declaration?

6 A. I’d be happy to.

7 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor?

8 THE COURT: Yes.

9 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Miss Chandler, have you

10 had a chance to look at that sworn declaration?

11 A. Yes, I have.

12 Q. Does it refresh your recollection about what

13 you said in the declaration?

14 A. Sort of.

15 Q. Isn’t it true you said the only reason you

16 signed it was because your ex-husband told you that

17 if you didn’t sign the stipulation, you would not

18 have Jordan returned to you, right?

19 A. That’s correct.

20 Q. You said that was the only reason, correct?

21 A. That’s not the only reason.

22 Q. Well, you signed it under penalty of

23 perjury, did you not?

24 A. I wasn’t asked who else was asking me to

25 sign it.

26 Q. Who prepared the declaration for you to

27 sign?

28 A. Evan Chandler’s attorney. 5660



1 Q. Were you represented by counsel when you

2 signed this declaration?

3 A. Oooh. I might have been.

4 Q. You actually were, weren’t you?

5 A. I -- I don’t recall.

6 Q. You were represented by counsel because you

7 were trying to set aside the stipulation in court,

8 right?

9 MR. SNEDDON: Well, Your Honor, I’m going to

10 object to that. That’s misleading as to point and

11 time, and vague.

12 MR. MESEREAU: It’s not misleading at all.

13 MR. SNEDDON: Wait a minute, Counsel.

14 Judge, I object as vague as to time as to

15 when she was represented.

16 THE COURT: All right. I’ll sustain the

17 objection. It’s an argumentative question.

18 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Miss Chandler, at some

19 point you hired a lawyer to help you set aside that

20 stipulation, right?

21 A. I don’t know if that was the reason why an

22 attorney was hired, if it was for that reason.

23 Q. And your attorney prepared your declaration,

24 true?

25 A. I don’t recall.

17 Michael Jackson?

20 A. Not at all.

21 Q. Okay. When you sued Michael Jackson, you

22 sued through Larry Feldman, true?

23 A. I did not sue Michael Jackson. Jordan

24 Chandler and his family were -- that was his family.

25 We did not sue Michael Jackson.

26 Q. Okay. So you never sued him yourself,

27 you’re saying?

28 A. I don’t believe that’s how it was worded. 5662



1 Q. Okay. Do you recall meetings with your

2 attorney about that lawsuit?

3 A. Yes, I do.

4 Q. Now, you -- you and Jordan’s father Evan

16 Q. Now, is it correct that he became Jordan’s

17 stepfather?

19 Q. And for how long was he Jordie’s stepfather?

20 A. For approximately six to eight years.

21 Q. What year did he cease to be Jordie’s

1 A. 11 years ago.

2 Q. At one point, David Schwartz sued Michael

3 Jackson, correct?

4 A. I don’t recall.

5 Q. Do you recall him suing Michael Jackson

6 claiming that Michael had interfered with his

7 business?

8 MR. SNEDDON: Your Honor, I’m going to

9 object as immaterial; irrelevant; calls for hearsay.

10 THE WITNESS: I don’t recall.

11 THE COURT: It’s vague as to time.

12 MR. MESEREAU: Okay. I’ll rephrase it, Your

13 Honor.

14 Q. Around the time you and Evan and Jordie sued

15 Michael Jackson with Attorney Larry Feldman, do you

16 recall your ex-husband, David Schwartz, also suing

17 Michael Jackson?

18 MR. SNEDDON: Same objection, Your Honor.

19 THE WITNESS: I don’t recall.

20 THE COURT: Overruled.

21 You may answer.

22 THE WITNESS: I don’t recall.

23 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Okay. Do you recall, in

24 response to your lawsuit, Mr. Jackson suing for

25 extortion?

26 MR. SNEDDON: Your Honor, I’m going to

27 object to that question.

28 THE COURT: Sustained. Foundation. 5664

7 from Sony. Sony recorders. We flew on the Sony

8 jet. That’s what I remember.

10 associating with Michael Jackson, that Michael

11 Jackson had an endorsement deal with PepsiCo?

14 lucrative endorsement deal anyone in the music

15 business had ever entered into with PepsiCo,

16 correct?

17 A. I didn’t know that.

18 MR. SNEDDON: Your Honor, that’s immaterial

19 and irrelevant.

24 was the last time before that you had spoken to

25 Larry Feldman?

26 A. Oh, um, maybe two months before that.

25 having to worry for the rest of his life?

10 thought, not what your ex-husband thought.

11 A. Well, I’m speculating also. I would be

12 speculating if I answered.

13 Q. Well, if someone says to you, “This is a

14 wonderful way not to have to worry for the rest of

15 our life,” doesn’t that suggest that maybe someone

16 is thinking about Michael Jackson supporting you?

19 Q. Okay. And what kind of -- stand-in work,

20 what does that --

21 A. Stand in for stars. It’s called second

22 team. They don’t use the stars to get the lights

23 bright. They use stand-ins.

24 Q. I see. During the year 2003, at some point

25 during that year, did you -- were you employed by

26 Michael Jackson?

27 A. Yes, sir.

28 Q. Is he the man seated to my right with the 5736



1 long black hair?

2 A. Yes, sir.

3 Q. Thank you.

4 When did you begin working for Mr. Jackson?

5 A. In June of 2003. Early June of 2003.

6 Q. And what was your -- what was your

7 assignment for Mr. Jackson?

8 A. Supervisor of Neverland.

9 Q. How did you come to get that position?

10 A. I met Michael at a studio, Marvin Gaye’s

11 studio in Hollywood.

12 Q. What were you doing at the studio?

13 A. My cousin was engineering Michael’s music

14 session, and Michael needed someone to whistle on a

15 track, so my cousin called me and said, “Would you

16 like to come down and whistle on Michael’s track?”

17 And I said, “I can’t whistle that well, but I would

18 love to come down and meet Michael Jackson.”

19 Q. Okay. Are you yourself a musician?

20 A. Yes, I am.

21 Q. And you met Mr. Jackson on that date?

22 A. Yes, sir.

23 Q. Can you tell me about -- was that in 2003?

24 A. Yes, it was.

25 Q. About what month was it, if you recall?

26 A. That was probably early -- sometime in

27 April.

28 Q. And how did it come about that you were 5737



1 offered employment?

2 A. I hung out at the studio with Michael and

3 his kids, and Chris Carter, maybe four, five days in

4 a row, three, four days in a row, while they were

5 working on the session.

6 Q. Who did you understand Chris Carter to be?

7 A. Michael’s personal security.

8 Q. And so somebody offered you employment?

9 A. On the last day there, Chris Carter asked me

10 to come outside. So I walked outside with him, and

11 at that time he told me that, you know, “Michael

12 likes you. He would love to bring you aboard. What

13 are you currently doing right now”?

14 Q. Were you available?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. Did they tell you what type of job they

17 wanted to hire you for?

18 A. Initially they hired me to be security,

19 along with Chris Carter, to travel with Michael.

20 Q. And how did that work out?

21 A. Well, that didn’t work for me because I had

22 triplets. I got three-year-old triplet boys, so....

23 Q. All right. So traveling wasn’t an option?

24 A. No. Actually, Michael was the one who said,

25 “If he has triplet boys, then I don’t want him to be

26 traveling with me all the time.”

27 Q. So you said you became ranch manager?

28 A. Yes. 5738



1 Q. How did that come about?

2 A. I guess Michael suggested to Chris, “If he

3 has triplets, he’ll be away from his kids a lot. So

4 maybe we should offer him another job,” and that’s

5 when supervisor of Neverland came up.

6 Q. So who offered you that position, I guess is

7 my question?

8 A. I guess Michael. But Chris Carter’s the one

9 who told me about the position.

10 Q. At some time did you discuss with Mr.

11 Jackson personally your employment?

12 A. I don’t understand the question.

13 Q. Did you ever have a discussion with Mr.

14 Jackson about your employment as ranch manager?

15 A. Yes, I did.

16 Q. Did he ever discuss with you the terms by

17 which you could be terminated if he was dissatisfied

18 with your work?

19 A. He didn’t discuss with me personally. But

20 Chris Carter and Joe Marcus did.

21 Q. And did you have an understanding about how

22 you could be terminated?

23 A. Yes.

24 Q. And what was that?

25 A. Grounds of giving up information of where

26 Michael Jackson’s whereabouts are, and, you know,

27 there was a rule on the ranch -- I don’t know if it

28 came directly from Michael, but, you know, Chris 5739



1 told me and Joe Marcus told me as well, that you can

2 never say no --

3 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; hearsay.

4 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Okay, let’s just back up a

5 minute.

6 Q. I think what my question is, did you know --

7 did you have some indication from Mr. Jackson as to

8 who had authority to terminate you?

9 A. Yes.

10 Q. And who was that?

11 A. From my understanding, it was only supposed

12 to be Michael Jackson.

13 Q. Okay. At some point during 2003, were you

14 terminated?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. Tell me about that. How did that come

17 about?

18 A. I had --

19 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; vague as to time.

20 THE COURT: I’ll ask you to clarify the time.

21 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Okay.

22 Q. When were you terminated?

23 A. Early August 2003.

24 Q. And how long had you been working at that

25 point for Mr. Jackson?

26 A. Maybe five, six weeks.

27 Q. When did you start work?

28 A. I was hired in the end of April, early May. 5740



1 But I had to go back to Michigan for a couple of

2 weeks, so the hiring process took awhile. You know,

3 background checks, physicals.

4 Q. When did you start going to Neverland?

5 A. In May.

6 Q. In May?

7 A. Yeah.

8 Q. And when did you start getting a paycheck?

9 A. In June.

10 Q. Okay. And what were you doing there in May?

11 A. I just came out to the ranch to check things

12 out to see the position that I would be, you know,

13 filling.

14 Q. In May, was it understood that you would be

15 the ranch manager?

16 A. Yes.

17 Q. And did you go up there and receive some

18 instruction from anybody as to what the duties were,

19 in May?

20 A. I received, well, sort of from Joe Marcus,

21 some instruction, but not as much as I did once I

22 started in June.

23 Q. What was Mr. Marcus’s assignment at that

24 time?

25 A. Ranch manager.

26 Q. So he was ranch manager and you were going

27 to take it over?

28 A. No. Ranch manager, you deal with the 5741



1 majority of the workers outside, the garden, the

2 landscapers, things like that. The carnival, the

3 festival, whatever.

4 Q. What was Joe Marcus doing?

5 A. What do you mean?

6 Q. Well, you said Joe Marcus was ranch manager.

7 A. Right, that was his position. Ranch

8 manager, you deal with all the employees basically

9 outside of the house.

10 Q. And your position was going to be?

11 A. Supervisor. Deal with the employees and

12 Michael and the kids in the house.

13 Q. Oh, in the house?

14 A. Yes.

15 Q. So house manager?

16 A. House manager.

17 Q. All right. Good.

18 So you began work in June, but you went up

19 there for how many weeks to get some training?

20 A. Not really training, just sort of to come

21 check things out, and to see who -- you know, what

22 position I would be taking and where the office was,

23 and things like that.

24 Q. And when was it you were terminated?

25 A. In early August.

26 Q. And how did that come about?

27 A. I had had a meeting with Michael about

28 transferring my position. And I liked working for 5742



1 him. I wanted to work for him somewhere in Los

2 Angeles, because my triplets were only one years old

3 at the time. So I was missing them, them being in

4 Los Angeles and me being here, and me staying the

5 night at Neverland often. Wasn’t working for me.

6 So I had a one-on-one meeting with him to be

7 transferred.

8 Q. And how did your termination come about?

9 A. I --

10 Q. Let me ask you this: Were you terminated?

11 A. Yes, I was.

12 Q. And how were you terminated?

13 A. I was terminated by Joe Marcus. He -- I

14 arrived at Neverland one morning for work and he

15 told me -- he had changed the locks on me. And then

16 I went into -- I mean, some -- one of the

17 employees -- one of my employees in the house told

18 me Joe came to change the locks. And I said, “Why?”

19 And they said, “I don’t know.” And I had already

20 been told by the guard at the gate that Joe --

21 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; hearsay.

22 THE COURT: Sustained.

23 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: So the locks were

26 Q. What did he tell you?

27 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; hearsay.

28 THE WITNESS: He told -- 5743



1 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I can go back to my last

2 question, I guess. I’ll withdraw that question,

3 Your Honor.

4 THE COURT: All right.

5 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: And how specifically --

6 I want you to go directly to the answer on this

7 question. How specifically did you learn that you

8 were terminated?

9 A. I --

10 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; asked and

11 answered.

12 THE COURT: Overruled.

13 You may answer.

14 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Go ahead.

15 A. I learned directly from Joe Marcus that my

16 services would no longer be needed at Neverland, and

17 that he didn’t have to give me a reason. Because

18 I --

19 Q. You asked him for a reason?

20 A. Yes, I did. I didn’t think I had done

21 anything wrong. Well, I know I hadn’t done anything

22 wrong.

23 Q. Okay. So you’d been at Neverland for a

24 little over a month, and you’d worked there for a

25 few weeks before that time as well?

26 A. Well, not worked. But like -- I wasn’t

27 getting paid for that time. That was just to come

28 out there and check the ranch out. 5744



1 Q. During the time that you were at Neverland,

2 did you have personal interaction with Michael

8 Q. More than once a day?

9 A. Yes.

10 Q. And who was responsible for handling Mr.

11 Jackson’s appointments while he was on the ranch?

12 A. At Neverland, I would take the -- all the

13 phone calls. It didn’t matter who it was calling;

14 mother, father, business person.

15 Q. So if he had an appointment for a day, would

16 you take that -- would that be part of your duties?

17 A. Yes.

18 Q. To schedule those appointments?

19 A. Yes.

20 with cleaning rooms and suites. And basically to,

21 you know, take care of whatever Michael and the kids

22 needed.

23 Q. And in terms of the day-to-day issues in

24 terms of running the ranch, can you characterize

27 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Vague; and

28 relevance. 5746



1 THE COURT: Overruled.

2 You may answer.

3 THE WITNESS: Mr. Jackson is in total charge

4 of the ranch.

5 Q. BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Why do you say that?

6 A. Well, when I was terminated, because of my

7 previous conversation with Chris Carter that only

8 Michael Jackson could terminate me, I called Evvy,

9 which is Michael’s personal assistant --

10 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Nonresponsive;

8 Q. Do you really know how many meetings there

9 were?

10 A. Around, I’m guessing, three to four.

11 MR. MESEREAU: Okay. Move to strike the

12 testimony, Your Honor.

13 THE COURT: Denied.

14 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: You’re guessing three to

15 four, but you don’t really know, right?

16 A. No, I couldn’t say. I couldn’t pinpoint it.

17 I wasn’t --

18 Q. You weren’t in the meetings, right?

19 A. No.

20 Q. You don’t remember what they looked like,

21 right?

22 A. I do remember what they looked like if I saw

23 a picture of them, yes.

24 Q. Well, the picture the prosecutor showed you,

25 you couldn’t identify, right?

26 A. Yes, sir.

27 Q. Okay. Now, you wanted to be transferred to

28 Los Angeles; is that correct? 5755



1 A. Yes. Yes, sir.

2 Q. And did you tell -- excuse me, who did you

3 talk to about the transfer?

4 A. Mr. Jackson.

5 Q. Okay. And you explained that the commute

6 and the hours were just too much to raise your

7 family?

8 A. I just wasn’t seeing my kids, and they were

9 one years old.

10 Q. And did you ask Mr. Jackson to be

11 transferred somewhere in Los Angeles?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. Okay. And where was that?

14 A. I just asked him to be transferred to any

15 business in Los Angeles that he had.

16 Q. But you really didn’t even know if there was

17 a job available in Los Angeles, right?

18 A. No, that’s why I was asking.

19 Q. Okay. Right. Okay. And approximately when

20 did you ask him; do you know?

22 Q. Okay. And Mr. Jackson was always nice to

23 you, wasn’t he?

4 Q. Pardon me?

5 A. A&R of his record label.

6 Q. Had you ever worked at a record label

7 before?

8 A. No, I hadn’t.

9 Q. All right. But at some point you learned

10 that you weren’t being hired, right?

11 A. No. As a matter of fact, I saw Michael

12 again at his birthday party in Los Angeles and he

13 told me I was still hired.

14 Q. Okay. But it never came through, right?

15 A. No, I’m still waiting for my paycheck now.

16 Q. Okay. You’re trying to write a book about

17 your experiences at Neverland, correct?

18 A. Well, no, I’m not trying to write a book

19 about my experiences at Neverland.

20 Q. Well, didn’t you -- excuse me. Did you say

21 Michael Jackson has a record label?

22 A. He told me he had a record label.

23 Q. Okay. Do you know that he doesn’t have one?

24 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection; assumes facts.

25 THE COURT: Sustained.

26 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Do you know whether or not

27 he really has a record label?

28 A. I was just told by him he had a record 5757



1 label.

2 Q. Okay. All right. Now, you prepared notes

3 for a book called “Entering Neverland, Secrets

4 Behind the Gate,” right?

5 A. Does it have my signature on it? Because I

6 know that within the last month or two, I started

7 jotting down information to myself and somehow my

8 information come up missing out of my house, but

9 whatever.

10 Q. Did you prepare notes for a book titled

11 “Entering Neverland, Secrets Behind the Gate” --

12 A. No.

13 Q. -- “By Dwayne Swingler, Head Supervisor of

14 Neverland Ranch, Summer of 2003,” did you prepare

15 that?

16 A. No.

17 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Objection; asked and

18 answered.

19 THE COURT: Overruled. The answer is, “No.”

20 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Are you aware of anything

21 like that?

22 A. No.

23 Q. You didn’t --

24 A. Am I aware of it? What do you mean?

25 Q. Yeah. Have you written out anything for a

26 book called “Entering Neverland, Secrets Behind the

27 Gate, by Dwayne Swingler”?

28 A. No, I haven’t written anything, or titled 5758



1 anything, or signed anything, or spoke to anybody

2 about, “This is my deal.”

3 Q. Have you talked to a group called News of

4 the World?

5 A. Have I?

6 Q. Yes.

7 A. Yeah, I spoke with one lady one time, yes.

8 Q. And to your knowledge, who is News of the

9 World?

10 A. To my knowledge, it’s a news media overseas.

11 Q. And why were you speaking to them?

12 A. Because I was interested in maybe possibly

13 writing down some information to -- to cash in on

14 something like everybody else was, because Michael

15 wasn’t -- I hadn’t received the paycheck from A&R at

16 the time.

17 Q. Okay. Did you enter into a nondisclosure

18 agreement with News of the World?

19 A. No, I did not.

20 Q. Have you ever seen one?

21 A. No, I did not.

22 Q. Did you ever talk to someone named David

23 Han-Schmidt?

24 A. The same time I spoke with the News of the

25 World lady, he’s the one that contacted her and

26 contacted me.

27 Q. And to your knowledge, who is David

28 Han-Schmidt? 5759



1 A. He said that he was a media agent. I don’t

2 even know how he got my phone number.

3 Q. When did you last talk to David Han-Schmidt?

4 A. He -- as a matter of fact, he called me

5 today.

6 Q. And to your knowledge, is he with a public

7 relations company?

8 A. I really don’t know what he did. He never

9 clarified that with me. He said he was an agent, he

10 was a producer, he was in public relations. I

11 basically ended the situation.

12 Q. To your knowledge, did anyone ever send you

13 a nondisclosure agreement regarding News of the

14 World?

15 A. No. I haven’t signed any nondisclosure

16 agreements, and I haven’t taken any money from

17 anyone.

18 Q. How many discussions have you had with David

19 Han-Schmidt?

20 A. Three. Four. Can’t remember.

21 Q. And when was the last one with him? Today?

22 A. He called me today, because he said he heard

23 that I was coming to testify.

24 Q. Okay. Have you ever put together any notes

25 for a possible book on the computer?

26 A. Excuse me?

27 Q. Have you ever put any notes for a possible

28 book on your computer? 5760



1 A. No, I haven’t.

2 Q. Have you ever written any notes out for a

3 possible book?

4 A. I told you I jotted down some information on

5 a piece of paper, and that’s all I’ve done.

6 Q. Did you ever ask any public relations person

7 to put together a proposal for you?

8 A. No, I haven’t.

9 Q. But you’re thinking of doing it, right, like

10 everybody else?

11 A. Yes, I was thinking about doing it.

12 Q. Okay. Okay. Have you ever seen -- excuse

13 me. Has anyone ever brought to your attention that

14 somebody has prepared notes for a possible book in

15 your name?

16 A. David.

17 Q. David Han-Schmidt?

18 A. Yes.

19 Q. Did he prepare them, to your knowledge?

20 A. He just said he received papers. I don’t

21 know -- like I told you, I don’t even know how he

22 got my phone number.

23 Q. Okay. If I showed you these papers, might

24 it refresh your recollection about where they came

25 from?

26 A. No, it probably wouldn’t, because I never

27 typed any papers or wrote out -- the only thing I

28 did was write down notes, jotted down notes on a 5761



1 piece of paper.

2 Q. Okay. And that was about your experience

3 during the five weeks at Neverland?

4 A. That was about my experience totally, not

5 just the five weeks at Neverland. That was my

6 experience with Michael’s manager and everything.

7 Q. Okay. Did you ever write down on those

8 notes the words “Secrets Behind the Gate”?

9 A. No, I did not.

10 Q. Okay. Did David Han-Schmidt tell you how he

11 got your name?

12 A. No, he did not.

13 Q. Okay. Did you ever ask him, “Why did you

14 call me?”

15 A. Well, actually, he started the conversation

16 off, and he just, whew, went straight to talking

17 about a lot of money, so I was listening to him

18 about a lot of money first.

19 Q. Did he promise you a lot of money?

20 A. That’s what he promised, yes.

21 Q. Okay. How much money did he promise?

22 A. He never said figures. He just said, you

23 know, “You can make a lot of money.” You know, “Why

24 aren’t you telling anyone your story?” That’s what

25 he said to me.

26 Q. It’s your understanding that he’s located in

27 Phoenix, Arizona?

28 A. Yes. That’s where he said he’s from. 5762



1 Q. Okay. Did he ever tell you he was going to

2 prepare a possible manuscript for you?

3 A. He asked me would I like him to, and I said

4 no. Like I told you, I terminated the conversation

5 when he told me what he wanted to do.

6 Q. Okay. And did he want some scandal sheet

7 about Michael, something like that?

8 A. Actually, he’s for Michael. He’s pro

9 Michael.

10 Q. Did he want you to write something about

11 Michael?

12 A. He wanted to speak on Michael’s behalf, yes.

13 Q. Okay. And how often -- in those three

14 conversations, did you talk about money each time?

15 A. No, I did not.

16 Q. Okay. Have you ever spoken to Miss Carol

17 Maung, M-a-u-n-g, who is the U.S. editor of News of

18 the World?

19 A. I spoke with her. I spoke with her when she

20 was with David when I got there.

21 Q. And did she fax you anything or e-mail you

22 anything?

23 A. Fax me anything or e-mail me anything?

24 Q. Yes.

25 A. No, sir.

26 Q. Okay. All right. When you were at

27 Neverland working --

28 A. Yes. 5763



1 Q. -- you had no direct contact with any member

2 of the Arvizo family, right?

3 A. The Arvizo family?

4 Q. Yes.

5 A. No, sir.

6 Q. That means you didn’t have any contact with

7 the Arvizos?

10 Cascio at Neverland?

11 A. Yes, sir.

13 A. Often.

14 Q. Okay. And to your knowledge, he’s a father?

15 A. He’s a father?

16 Q. Yes.

17 A. I didn’t know he was a father.

18 Q. Okay. Did he ever talk to you about work he

19 did?

20 A. Did Dominick ever talk to me about work he

21 did?

22 Q. Yeah.

23 A. Some work at the restaurant that his family

24 owned.

25 MR. MESEREAU: Okay. I have no further

26 questions, Your Honor.

27 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Counsel?

28 (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel 5764



1 table.)

2 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Maybe we should approach.

3 Your Honor, may we approach?

4 THE COURT: For what?

5 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Concerning the materials

6 that counsel is using to cross-examine the witness

7 on.

8 THE COURT: All right.

9 (Discussion held off the record at sidebar.)

10 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: If I could just have a

11 moment, Your Honor.

12 THE COURT: Yes.

13 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: I think I can finish with

14 this witness, Your Honor. Just one question.

15

16 REDIRECT EXAMINATION

17 BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

18 Q. Mr. Swingler, do you know if David Schmidt

19 has any affiliation with Michael Jackson?

20 A. I just know that he has a website; that

21 he’s, you know, pro Michael Jackson.

22 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: All right. Thank you.

23 I have no further questions.

24 MR. MESEREAU: No further questions, Your

25 Honor.

26 THE COURT: All right. Thank you. You may

27 step down.

28 THE WITNESS: Thank you, sir. 5765



1 THE COURT: Do you have another witness?

2 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: (To Mr. Sneddon) Go

3 ahead.

4 MR. SNEDDON: You.

5 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: Do you want me to do it?

6 (Laughter.)

7 MR. SNEDDON: We’re trying to figure out

8 which one of us should take responsibility for

9 telling you “No.”

10 (Laughter.)

11 MR. SNEDDON: And being the great delegator

12 I am, I’m leaving it up to Gordon.

13 MR. AUCHINCLOSS: We have no further

14 witnesses, Your Honor. We just anticipated that

15 there would be -- it would take a little longer to

16 get through these witnesses today.

17 THE COURT: All right. There’s a couple of

18 items that we can take up. I’ll go ahead and excuse

19 the jury.

20 (To the jury) Remember the admonitions I’ve

21 given you and I’ll see you tomorrow morning at 8:30.

22 But it’s a half day tomorrow, remember. How could

23 you forget, right?

24

25 (The following proceedings were held in

26 open court outside the presence and hearing of the

27 jury:)

28 5766



1 THE COURT: All right. First, there was --

2 my understanding is that the special master will

3 have the report available tomorrow morning for you

4 on the computer hard drives.

5 MR. SNEDDON: On both of them, Your Honor?

6 THE COURT: Yes. They’re working on some

7 last-minute details. So it will be available

8 tomorrow morning.

9 MR. SNEDDON: Now, at that point, then, Your

10 Honor, does it need to go to you for final decision,

11 or is that the decision?

12 THE COURT: I don’t know. I haven’t read

13 the report. I was handed a rough draft of one by my

14 research attorney this morning -- well, not this

15 morning, a few minutes ago. And I asked him to talk

16 to Mr. Sanger about an issue. So I can’t answer

17 your question.

18 MR. SNEDDON: Okay.

19 THE COURT: I suspect it doesn’t need to go

20 beyond what’s been done by the special master, so --

21 MR. SNEDDON: Okay.

22 THE COURT: But I won’t know till I’ve looked

23 at it.

24 The second thing is that both of you have

25 submitted points and authorities on Janet Arvizo.

26 The District Attorney’s I’ve read.

27 And I just received the defense, so I

28 haven’t had time to read yours. 5767



1 When do you expect to call Janet Arvizo?

2 MR. ZONEN: Either tomorrow or Wednesday.

3 Depending on if we finish the witnesses scheduled

4 before her tomorrow. If not --

5 THE COURT: They can’t hear behind you.

6 (To the audience) He said either tomorrow

7 or Wednesday.

8 MR. ZONEN: As early as tomorrow.

9 THE COURT: As early as tomorrow.

10 Okay. Well, I’m not really prepared to deal

11 with that issue. We’ll have to deal with it before

12 she’s called, but I’ll need to study the material

13 you’ve given me, the defense has given me.

14 MR. ZONEN: Thank you.

15 THE COURT: Was there anything else pending?

16 MR. SANGER: On that issue, Your Honor, as I

17 explained to you, as I explained to your clerk, we

18 were served with their papers this morning. We

19 thought they might call Ms. Arvizo today.

20 THE COURT: Right.

21 MR. SANGER: So we put something together

22 very quickly, and I would like to have an

23 opportunity to explain to the Court a little more,

24 in a little more organized fashion, where this goes,

25 now that we’ve had a few more minutes to think about

26 it.

27 THE COURT: I’ll make sure you have that

28 opportunity. 5768



1 MR. SANGER: Okay. Thank you.

2 THE COURT: All right. Then we’ll recess

3 until tomorrow morning.
