14 DIRECT EXAMINATION (Continued)
15 BY MR. SNEDDON:
16 Q. Good morning.
17 A. Good morning.
18 Q. I just have a few questions left. Okay.
19 You’ve indicated to the ladies and gentlemen
20 of the jury that an individual by the name of Aldo
21 was present during some of the events that you’ve
22 described; do you recall that.
23 A. Yes. Yes.
24 Q. Were there times when you were at the ranch
25 and Aldo was not there.
26 A. Yes.
27 Q. Were there times when you were at the ranch
28 when Mr. Jackson and Aldo was not there. 1189
 

 
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. With regard to your sister - okay. -
3 Davellin --
4 A. Okay.
5 Q. -- did Mr. Jackson ever make any statements
6 about Davellin to you.
7 A. He told us not to tell her anything because
8 he’s afraid we might tell our mom.
9 Q. About what.
10 A. About what we’re doing.
11 Q. What do you mean. What were you doing at
12 the time that Mr. Jackson was making those
13 statements to you.
14 A. Drinking.
15 Q. Now, I want to just show you two last
16 photographs.
17 Mr. Mesereau.
18 Just take a look at those for a second, and
19 I’m going to ask you some questions.
20 The first number on that is People’s No. 80
21 for identification; is that correct.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And with regard to the photograph,
24 People’s 80 for identification, do you recognize
25 that.
26 A. Yes.
27 Q. And is that an accurate depiction of what it
28 purports to represent. 1190
 

 
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. And with regard to People’s 81 for
3 identification --
4 A. 82.
5 Q. It’s 82.
6 A. Yeah.
7 Q. Okay. With regard to that, is that an
8 accurate depiction of what it purports to represent.
9 A. Yes.
10 MR. SNEDDON: Your Honor, I move that 80 and
11 82 be admitted into evidence.
12 THE COURT: They’re admitted.
13 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: All right. Now, would you
14 put 80 on the top, Star. Do you have 80 on top.
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Okay.
17 Now, Your Honor, with the Court’s
18 permission, could we activate the overhead.
19 All right. Now, with regard to No. 80,
20 would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury
21 what that is.
22 A. That’s the view of the bed from the
23 stairway.
24 Q. Now, with regard to this particular
25 photograph, People’s 80, is there anything different
26 about the photograph than the night that you went up
27 there and saw your brother on the bed with Mr.
28 Jackson with the events that you’ve described to the 1191
 

 
1 jury yesterday, late yesterday.
2 A. No.
3 Q. Now, with regard to the next photograph,
4 People’s 82 -- is that People’s 82.
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. All right. With regard to that view, what
7 is that.
8 A. That’s the view of the bed from the
9 stairway.
10 Q. Now, with regard to that particular
11 photograph, were the lighting conditions the same or
12 different than depicted in this photograph.
13 A. Different.
14 Q. And how were they different.
15 A. The lights above the bed were off.
16 Q. And what was the light -- the source of the
17 light when you made your observations on the two
18 occasions.
19 A. The lighting was from the stairs.
20 Q. Now, you see the -- the comforter, or the
21 cover of the bed there.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Can you tell us whether or not that was the
24 same comforter or bed covering that was on the bed
25 at the time that you were visiting the ranch back in
26 February and March of 2003.
27 A. It was.
28 Q. And on the night that you said that you saw 1192
 

 
1 your brother on the bed on the first occasion with
2 Mr. Jackson, was that comforter on the bed on that
3 occasion.
4 A. No. It was rolled down.
5 Q. Rolled down where.
6 A. On the floor.
7 Q. And so what was the surface of the bed at
8 that point.
9 A. Another blanket.
10 Q. Do you recall what color that blanket was.
11 A. No. It was like red. It was different
12 colors.
13 Q. All right. Now, with regard to the second
14 time that you saw your brother on the bed with Mr.
15 Jackson that you described to the jury yesterday,
16 where -- where -- what was the condition of that
17 comforter at that time, the blue comforter.
18 A. Rolled up and on the floor.
19 Q. So it was the same both times.
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Okay. You can put that down, if you like.
22 Do you remember whether or not on the night
23 that you saw Mr. Jackson -- on the first occasion
24 when you saw Mr. Jackson on the bed with your
25 brother, whether or not the screen, the movie
26 screen, was up or down.
27 A. It was down.
28 Q. So it was in the same condition that it is 1193
 

 
1 now.
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. And how about on the second occasion.
4 A. It was up.
5 Q. Now, at any time while you were at the ranch
6 from the time you got back from Miami till the time
7 that you left for the last time, did Mr. Jackson
8 ever make any statements to you about -- other
9 than -- about your sister, about not telling things.
10 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; leading.
11 THE COURT: Sustained.
12 MR. SNEDDON: What did he say. I didn’t
13 hear what he said.
14 I’m sorry. I didn’t hear the Court’s
15 ruling.
16 THE COURT: Sustained.
17 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: At any time while you were
18 at the ranch during the period of time from Miami
19 till the time that you left, did you have any other
20 conversations with Mr. Jackson that you haven’t told
21 us about. Just “Yes” or “No.”
22 A. Yes. Yes.
23 Q. Okay. And with regard to those
24 conversations, what topics have you not told us
25 about so far in your testimony that you had a
26 discussion with Mr. Jackson about.
27 A. There was one time Michael told me -- well,
28 it was me, my brother and Aldo were on the bed, and 1194
 

 
1 he was telling us not to tell anything that
2 happened, “Not even if they put a gun to your head.”
3 Q. Did he say why.
4 A. No.
5 MR. SNEDDON: No further questions, Your
6 Honor.
7 THE COURT: Cross-examine.
8 MR. MESEREAU: Yes, please, Your Honor.

13 Q. And have you heard it before.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. When did you hear the alarm that goes off
16 when you enter Michael Jackson’s hallway.

7 MR. SANGER: Your Honor, I’m sorry, it’s
8 hard to hear the witness here.
9 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: You say it’s not an alarm,
10 it’s just a bell.
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Is it an electric bell.
13 A. Yes.

20 Q. Have you ever tried to turn that alarm

23 Q. Did you ever ask anyone, “How do you turn
24 that alarm system off.”
25 A. No.

27 you’ve walked through that hallway, that bell has
28 gone off, right. 1200

2 Q. And your understanding is that the purpose

17 guards at Neverland.
18 A. The master code.
19 Q. And do you know what security guard gave
20 that to you.
21 A. No. I don’t remember.
22 Q. And what is the master code.
23 A. 1849.
24 Q. And what does it do.
25 A. It gets you into all the doors in Neverland.

10 bedrooms many times, right.
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. And you’ve been in other rooms in the main

14 A. Yes.
15 Q. You’ve been into what other rooms in the
16 main house.
17 A. His room, Michael’s room. Prince and
18 Paris’s room. I think that -- I think those are the
19 doors -- oh, and then the two doors to enter the
20 main house.
21 Q. Have you been into any other rooms in the
22 main house.
23 A. The kitchen room. The living room. The
24 kitchen. Those are the only rooms I’ve been in.
25 Q. When did you get the code that lets you into
26 every room in the house.
27 A. A little after the Miami trip.
28 Q. You had been into every room in the house 1202
 

 
1 before you went to Miami, hadn’t you.
2 A. No.
3 Q. You had not been into every room in the
4 house before you went to Miami.
5 A. Not every room.
6 Q. Didn’t you go into the main house when Chris
7 Tucker was there and Michael Jackson was absent.
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. And you went upstairs when Chris Tucker was
10 there and Michael Jackson was absent, didn’t you.
11 A. No.
12 MR. MESEREAU: Your Honor, I think we’re
13 having trouble hearing, hearing the witness. If he
14 could just talk a little louder.
15 THE COURT: Everyone seems to be hearing.
16 MR. SANGER: Sometimes you can’t.
17 THE COURT: The audience is all nodding
18 affirmatively.
19 THE JURY: (In unison) We’re not.
20 THE DEFENDANT: Thank you. We can’t hear.
21 We can’t hear.
22 MR. MESEREAU: I didn’t want to instruct the
23 witness. I didn’t think it was my -- it was
24 appropriate. If the Court would, I’d appreciate it,
25 Your Honor.
26 THE COURT: You need to speak up. People
27 right there can’t hear you.
28 THE WITNESS: Okay. 1203
 

 
1 MR. MESEREAU: Because some people didn’t
2 hear, I’m going to go over a little bit of this
3 again.
4 Q. How many times were you at Neverland before
5 the Miami trip.
6 A. I don’t know exactly.
7 Q. Approximately.
8 A. I don’t know exactly.
9 Q. I’m just asking if you can estimate.
10 A. Ten.
11 Q. Ten. And of those ten trips, how many do
12 you think Michael was present at. I’m talking about
13 the trips before you went to Miami.
14 A. I don’t know. I know it was more than
15 twice.
16 Q. Okay. When did you first learn there was an
17 alarm system when you entered the hallway to go to
18 Michael Jackson’s bedroom.
19 A. First time we entered his bedroom.
20 Q. And approximately when was that, if you
21 know.
22 A. I don’t know.
23 Q. And did you see Michael Jackson do anything
24 to the alarm system --
25 A. No.
26 Q. -- when you first entered his bedroom.
27 A. No.
28 Q. So it went off, didn’t it. 1204
 

 
1 A. What.
2 Q. When you first entered Michael Jackson’s
3 bedroom, the alarm system in the hallway went off,
4 right.
5 A. The bell.
6 Q. The bell that is an alarm system, right.
7 A. I didn’t think it was an alarm system.
8 Q. You didn’t think the bell that went off when
9 you entered the hallway was an alarm system.
10 A. Well, because I’m thinking, like, an alarm,
11 like.
12 Q. But you knew it was an electric bell,
13 correct.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. And you knew anytime you entered that
16 hallway it went off, right.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. When you first went into the hallway, you
19 heard that bell, didn’t you.
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. You never saw Michael Jackson dismantle that
22 system, did you.
23 A. No.
24 Q. In fact, every time you’ve walked into that
25 hallway to go into Michael Jackson’s bedroom, that
26 bell has rung, right.
27 MR. SNEDDON: I’m going to object, asked and
28 answered. 1205
 

 
1 MR. MESEREAU: I didn’t -- excuse me, Your
2 Honor, I don’t think I’ve ever asked that question.
3 THE COURT: Overruled.
4 THE WITNESS: Repeat the question.
5 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Sure. Every time you --
6 THE COURT: I’ll have the court reporter
7 repeat it.
8 MR. MESEREAU: I’m sorry.
9 (Record read.)
10 THE WITNESS: Yes.
11 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Now, during the two times
12 you claim you saw Michael Jackson touch your brother
13 in bed, that bell went off, didn’t it.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. When you walk into the hallway, Mr. Arvizo,
16 is there another alarm system.
17 A. Which hallway.
18 Q. The hallway going into Mr. Jackson’s
19 bedroom. Once you go through the hallway, the bell
20 goes off, right.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. And when you try to go into Michael
23 Jackson’s bedroom upstairs, is there any other
24 alarm.
25 A. No.
26 Q. Have you ever had heard of there being
27 another alarm that goes off as you try to enter
28 Michael Jackson’s bedroom. 1206
 

 
1 A. No.
2 Q. Okay. You’re aware that if you’re in
3 Michael Jackson’s bedroom upstairs, you can hear
4 that bell.
5 A. When the doors are open.
6 Q. Pardon me.

8 don’t tell me.” So I didn’t say nothing. I just
9 wanted to go over it by myself.
10 Q. You wanted to go over the diagram just by
11 yourself.
12 A. Oh, in my head.
13 Q. In your head.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Okay. So correct me if I’m wrong, you
16 looked at this diagram; everybody was silent, and
17 you thought about it in your head, right.
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. And then you gave it back to Prosecutor
20 Sneddon, right.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Never discussed anything about what’s on the
23 diagram, right.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Never discussed it at all, right.
26 A. Yes.
27 Q. Okay. Now, in one of your police
28 interviews, you were asked if you knew the 1250
 

 
1 difference between right and wrong, remember.
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. And you said you learned the difference
4 between right and wrong from your mom, right.
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And that was the truth, right.
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Okay. Your mom told you never to lie,
9 right.
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Did she tell you that before the J.C. Penney
12 deposition.
13 A. She told us that our whole life.
14 Q. Whole life.
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Okay. You actually told the police that you
17 think lying is a sin, right.
18 A. Yes, I think so.
19 Q. Do you remember if you did that.
20 A. Not really.
21 Q. Okay. Would it refresh your recollection if
22 I show you the transcript.
23 A. Sure.
24 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor.
25 THE COURT: Actually, he testified that, yes,
26 he told the police that.
27 MR. MESEREAU: Oh, I thought -- I didn’t --
28 THE COURT: Then you went on to his memory. 1251
 

 
1 So, denied.
2 MR. MESEREAU: Okay.
3 THE COURT: Move along.
4 MR. MESEREAU: All right.
5 Q. You know you’re not supposed to lie under
6 oath, right.
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Okay. Has anyone discussed that with you
9 before.
10 A. My whole family.
11 Q. Okay.
12 A. The D.A.
13 Q. They have all told you, “Don’t ever lie
14 under oath,” right.
15 A. Yes. They just told me to tell the truth.
16 Q. Okay. Now, you talked about driving golf
17 carts at Neverland, right.
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. And you and your brothers used to do that
20 during your visits to Neverland, right.
21 A. Yes.
22 THE COURT: Let’s take our break, Counsel.
23 MR. MESEREAU: Yes, Your Honor.

11 Q. Okay. I’m just trying to find out
12 approximately when -- excuse me.
13 Yesterday you told the jury that at one
14 point you left Neverland for the last time, right.
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. And you never came back again, right.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And that was before you went to see Attorney
19 Larry Feldman, wasn’t it.
20 A. Before we left Neverland.
21 Q. No. You left Neverland for the last time
22 before you first met Attorney Larry Feldman, right.
23 A. I don’t understand the question.
24 Q. Okay. At some point you met Attorney Larry
25 Feldman, right.
26 A. Yes.
27 Q. And you went to see Attorney Larry Feldman
28 with your mom, right. 1259

10 A. Yes.
11 Q. And you saw him after you first met Attorney
12 Larry Feldman, right.
13 A. Yes. Yes.
14 Q. And you met Attorney Larry Feldman after you
15 met Attorney William Dickerman, right.
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. And this all happened in the spring of 2003,
18 didn’t it.
19 A. I don’t -- I don’t remember.
20 Q. You don’t know. You were never at Neverland
21 in the summer of 2003, were you.
22 A. Correct.
23 Q. Pardon me.
24 A. Correct.
25 Q. And you discussed many times with the Santa
26 Barbara Sheriffs the fact that you left Neverland in
27 the spring of 2003 and never came back, right.
28 A. Wait. 1260
 

 
1 Q. Sure.
2 A. I was there in 2003.
3 Q. No, no. You were there in 2003, but you
4 left in the spring, didn’t you.
5 A. I don’t remember when I left.
6 Q. Okay. Have you ever discussed with the
7 sheriffs when you left.
8 A. I don’t remember.
9 Q. Okay. Do you know if you were there in July
10 of 2003.
11 A. Don’t remember.
12 Q. Okay. You could have been.
13 A. Probably.
14 Q. Pardon me.
15 A. Probably.
16 Q. Okay. You told the jury the first night you
17 spent at Neverland, you slept where.
18 A. First out of all the trips.
19 Q. Yes.
20 A. In the guest unit.
21 Q. And that was your first night, right.
22 A. Of the first time I ever went to Neverland.
23 Q. Okay. Now, the first time you went to
24 Neverland, do you recall having dinner with Michael
25 Jackson in the main dining room.
26 A. Yes.
27 Q. And who was there for that dinner.
28 A. My mom -- wait. I know it was my dad, my 1261
 

 
1 brother, me, my sister, Michael. I think my mom was
2 there also.
3 Q. Okay. Let me ask you this: You don’t
4 recall seeing Psychologist Sanely Katz in May of
5 2003, right.
6 A. I don’t -- I don’t know the dates.
7 Q. Okay. Would it refresh your recollection if
8 I just show you his testimony. Would that help you.
9 A. His.
10 Q. If I showed you what Psychologist Stanley
11 Katz told the grand jury.
12 A. Sure. But I don’t know the dates.
13 Q. Okay. If I showed you what he said, would
14 that remind you.
15 A. I never knew the dates.
16 Q. Okay. Okay. So even if you saw it, it
17 wouldn’t --
18 A. No.
19 Q. -- wouldn’t jog your memory.
20 Okay. Okay. And if I told you you saw
21 Stanley Katz again in June of 2003, that wouldn’t
22 jog your memory, would it.
23 A. No.
24 Q. All right. And if I told you when you first
25 saw Attorney Larry Feldman, that wouldn’t jog your
26 memory, would it.
27 A. No.
28 Q. Okay. But you never went back after you met 1262
 

 
1 Psychologist Katz, right.
2 MR. SNEDDON: Excuse me, Your Honor. Vague.
3 THE COURT: Sustained.
4 MR. MESEREAU: Okay.
5 Q. Do you know if you ever returned to
6 Neverland after you first met Psychologist Stanley
7 Katz.
8 A. We never returned after we met Stanley Katz.
9 Q. Okay. And would it be true -- excuse me.
10 It is true that you never returned to Neverland
11 after you met Attorney Larry Feldman, right.
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And you first spoke to the Santa Barbara
14 Sheriffs after you met Stanley Katz, right.
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. And you first went to the Santa Barbara
17 Sheriffs after you met Attorney Larry Feldman,
18 right.
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Is there anything I could show you that
21 would remind you --
22 A. I never knew the dates.
23 Q. Okay -- - of when you met Attorney Feldman.
24 Don’t know.
25 A. Never knew.
26 Q. All right. Okay. Do you have any idea what
27 month it was when you last went to Neverland.
28 A. No. 1263
 

 
1 Q. Okay. All right. But you never were there
2 in August of 2003, were you.
3 A. I don’t remember the dates.
4 Q. You don’t know, okay.
5 Now, you told the Santa Barbara Sheriffs
6 about the locks in Michael Jackson’s home, did you
7 not.
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. You said his bedroom has double doors,
10 right.
11 A. Yes. When you first enter the room.
12 Q. And you said there are several locks, right.
13 A. There’s seven locks.
14 Q. Seven locks.
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Including a combination lock, right.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. How did you know there were seven locks.
19 A. I don’t know. I just remember looking at
20 them.
21 Q. Did you know the combination to that
22 combination lock.
23 A. Do you mean the digit key pad.
24 Q. Well, you told the police there’s a
25 combination lock, didn’t you.
26 A. I said there was a key pad.
27 Q. Okay. Was that the code you were talking
28 about. 1264
 

 
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. All right. And did that code unlock the
3 seven locks.
4 A. No, it only unlocked one lock. The other
5 six locks were unlocked manually.
6 Q. Were what.
7 A. Were unlocked by hand.
8 Q. Okay. Have you ever unlocked any of those
9 several locks.
10 A. I really don’t remember.
11 Q. You don’t remember at all.
12 A. No.
13 Q. You were caught trying to unlock those locks
14 one time, weren’t you.
15 A. When.
16 Q. At Neverland.
17 A. I don’t remember that.
18 Q. Do you recall anyone from security ever
19 catching you trying to open those locks.
20 A. From the outside.
21 Q. Yes.
22 A. You -- it’s impossible to open them from the
23 outside.
24 Q. Did you ever try to do it.
25 A. No.
26 Q. Were you ever caught by any security person
27 trying to open those locks.
28 A. No. 1265
 

 
1 Q. Don’t recall that at all.
2 A. If -- if I ever went to the door and punched
3 in the -- the key code, if it didn’t open, I just
4 left. I never tried to force it open.
5 Q. So, you’re telling the jury that you did go,
6 on at least one occasion --
7 A. No, I’m saying if that ever happened.
8 Q. If it ever happened.
9 A. If those two doors were locked.
10 Q. Right. If they were locked and you didn’t
11 know the code, you couldn’t get in, right.
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And are you saying you tried a code one time
14 that didn’t work.
15 A. No, I’m just saying.
16 Q. Just saying what.
17 A. If the door was locked and you punch in the
18 key code, there’s no other way you could possibly
19 get in.
20 Q. All right. Because you tried it and it
21 didn’t work one time, right.
22 A. I never said I did.
23 Q. Did you.
24 A. I’m just saying if I tried, that would
25 happen.
26 Q. Did you ever try that.
27 A. No.
28 Q. Never once. 1266
 

 
1 A. No.
2 Q. And never were caught by anyone trying to
3 use the wrong code.
4 A. No.
5 Q. Okay. Do you know if your brother was ever
6 caught trying to use the wrong code to get in.
7 A. No.
8 Q. Okay. Now, you told the sheriffs that the
9 code was either 1960 or 1849, right.
10 A. It was 1960 and 1849.
11 Q. How did you know that.
12 A. Because 1849 was the master code. And 1960,
13 1960 got you into Michael’s room.
14 Q. Okay. You told the sheriffs that 1849 is a
15 general combination for Neverland, right.
16 A. Yes. It’s the master code.
17 Q. And 1960 is a combination for Michael’s
18 bedroom, right.
19 A. Yes. It’s the code for Michael’s bedroom.
20 Q. Which one are you telling the jury the
21 security guard gave you.
22 A. 1849.
23 Q. Do you know why the security guard gave it
24 to you and not Michael.
25 A. We never really asked Michael for that. He
26 just showed us one day.
27 Q. The security guard did.
28 A. Yes. 1267
 

 
1 Q. And you remember the codes to this day,
2 right.
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. How many times do you think you’ve used
5 those codes.
6 A. A lot of times.
7 Q. How many times; do you think.
8 A. Probably over a hundred.
9 Q. Over a hundred times you’ve been to Michael
10 Jackson’s bedroom.
11 A. No, it gets you in everywhere.
12 Q. So you’ve probably used these codes to see
13 every room in Neverland, right.
14 A. No, I just -- I just knew the codes.
15 Q. Huh.
16 A. I memorized them.
17 Q. Okay.
18 A. So I won’t get locked out.
19 Q. But you’ve used them about a hundred times
20 you said, right.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. You’ve been into every single room at
23 Neverland, haven’t you.
24 A. At one point, yes.
25 Q. You went in with your brothers, right. Or,
26 excuse me, your brother, right.
27 A. In every room.
28 Q. Yes. 1268
 

 
1 A. No.
2 Q. Did you go to every room by yourself.
3 A. No, I was either with -- I was with someone.
4 Q. Well, you weren’t always with Michael,
5 right.
6 A. I was probably in the toy room with Prince
7 and Paris and Grace.
8 Q. Okay. Did you let them into the room.
9 A. What.
10 Q. Did you use the code and let them into the
11 room.
12 A. No. Grace knew the code.
13 Q. I’m asking you if you remember how many
14 times you think you’ve used these codes --
15 A. A lot of times.
16 Q. -- to get into the rooms at Neverland. You
17 said about 100, right.
18 A. No, I’m guessing. I’m just saying I used
19 them a lot of times.
20 Q. Why did you pick the number 100.
21 A. I don’t know. I’m just trying to show that
22 I used them a lot of times.
23 Q. All right. And you used them many times
24 when Michael Jackson wasn’t even at Neverland,
25 right.
26 A. He was there. It got you into the house.
27 It got you into his bedroom. Got you into the front
28 door. 1269
 

 
1 Q. But you’ve used those codes many times when
2 Michael Jackson wasn’t even at Neverland, right.
3 A. When.
4 Q. I’m asking you.
5 A. I never used them. What did you say.
6 Q. No, let me rephrase it.
7 You personally, Star Arvizo, have used those
8 codes to get into rooms at Neverland when Michael
9 Jackson wasn’t even there, right.
10 A. No. No.
11 Q. You’re saying --
12 A. We barely learned those codes after the
13 Miami trip. I never knew them before.
14 Q. Do you recall ever being caught in the wine
15 cellar --
16 A. The wine cellar doesn’t have a combination
17 lock.
18 Q. Do you recall ever being caught in the wine
19 cellar drinking wine when Michael Jackson wasn’t
20 present.
21 A. Never.
22 Q. Never happened.
23 A. It -- it’s always locked, and it always --
24 it -- to unlock it you need a key. There’s no
25 combination to get in there.
26 Q. Let me repeat my question.
27 Do you recall ever being caught in the wine
28 cellar at Neverland with Gavin drinking wine when 1270
 

 
1 Michael Jackson wasn’t even there.
2 A. No.
3 Q. Are you saying that never happened.
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Do you ever recall being caught at any other
6 location in Neverland drinking wine when Michael
7 Jackson wasn’t there.
8 A. No.
9 Q. Okay. That never happened.
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Okay. Now, you just told the jury
12 voluntarily where the key is to get in the wine
13 cellar, right.
14 A. No, I said that the door, the wine cellar
15 needed a key to get in there.
16 Q. And you knew where the key was, correct.
17 A. I knew it was in the lounge.
18 Q. You knew where it was hanging in the lounge,
19 right.
20 A. Not exactly. I didn’t know where it was
21 hanging. I just knew it was in the lounge.
22 Q. Well, please describe the lounge for the
23 jury.
24 A. It has a closet, a couch, a rest room with a
25 shower. It was pretty small.
26 Q. You’ve been in the lounge many times,
27 haven’t you.
28 A. No. 1271
 

 
1 Q. How many times have you been in the lounge.
2 A. Once to put on a cooking shirt.
3 Q. You’ve been in the lounge once to put on a

26 you their report.
27 A. Sure.
28 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor. 1292
 

 
1 THE COURT: Yes.
2 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Have you had a chance to
3 look at that page.
4 A. Yes, but --
5 Q. “But” what.
6 A. I never said that. That’s just a paragraph
7 that somebody wrote.
8 Q. So you never said that to the Santa Barbara
9 Sheriffs --
10 A. I might have, but I don’t remember saying
11 it.
12 Q. Well, you are saying that if it appears in a
13 report, it’s wrong.
14 A. Well, I’m saying I never remember saying it.
15 Q. Okay. Star, you and your brother were
16 caught at Neverland looking at computer sites when
17 Michael wasn’t even there, right.
18 A. There’s no computers at Neverland.
19 Q. Your brother had one.
20 A. At the beginning. But then it broke, and
21 then we never had it again. And the only other
22 computer there was Frank’s computer, and Frank took
23 it everywhere he went.
24 Q. Okay. So you never were caught by
25 anybody --
26 A. No.
27 Q. -- looking at adult material sites on a
28 computer. 1293
 

 
1 A. No.
2 Q. Is that correct.
3 A. There’s no computers in Neverland.
4 Q. Okay. Now, did you tell the sheriffs that
5 Michael Jackson kept your family away from clocks.
6 A. Well, we never knew the time.
7 Q. Well, did you tell the Santa Barbara
8 Sheriffs that, “Michael Jackson would never let us
9 look at clocks,” or words to that effect.
10 A. Words -- could I see it.
11 Q. I’m just asking you.
12 A. No. Well, yes. Probably said it to an
13 extent like that.
14 Q. Well, just tell the jury, if you would, how
15 you remember saying it.
16 A. I just remember saying that -- I don’t
17 remember how exactly how I said it.
18 Q. Well, you said words to the effect, “Michael
19 Jackson kept my family away from clocks and time,”
20 right.
21 A. Were those my exact words.
22 Q. No, I’m saying, words to that effect. Do
23 you remember exactly how you said it to the sheriff.
24 A. No. I don’t know exactly.
25 Q. Do you remember roughly how you said it to
26 the sheriffs.
27 A. Not really.
28 Q. Did you say anything like that to the 1294
 

 
1 sheriffs.
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Please tell the jury what you told the
4 sheriffs.
5 A. I’m going to be guessing, because I don’t
6 know my exact words.
7 Q. Okay. I’m not asking for your exact words.
8 I’m just asking you for generally what you said.
9 A. They kept us away from the clocks. We
10 didn’t know the exact time or the date or nothing.
11 Q. Would you agree that overlooking Neverland
12 is a huge clock.
13 A. Yes. It’s a flower clock.
14 Q. Yes. And to the right of that big flower
15 clock is another clock, correct.
16 A. Probably.
17 Q. There are clocks all over Neverland,
18 correct.
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And you and your brothers used to run all
21 around Neverland, right.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. You wanted the sheriffs to think that you
24 and your family were imprisoned and kept away from
25 clocks.
26 A. No.
27 Q. That’s why you told them that lie, right.
28 A. No. 1295
 

 
1 Q. If there are clocks all over Neverland, if
2 there’s a big flower clock on a hill overlooking
3 Neverland, and if you and your brothers were running
4 freely around Neverland, why did you tell the Santa
5 Barbara Sheriffs “We were kept away from clocks and
6 time”.
7 A. Because they were wrong and we were kept
8 away from them. We weren’t able to know the time.
9 Q. Your mother told you to say that, didn’t
10 she.
11 A. No.
12 Q. It was a lie, wasn’t it.
13 A. No.
14 Q. It defies common sense, doesn’t it.
15 A. Can you explain that.
16 Q. You don’t know what that means.
17 A. I know what common sense is.
18 Q. Everywhere you go at Neverland, you can see
19 clocks, right.
20 A. Not everywhere.
21 Q. Most places, right.
22 A. Yes, most places.
23 Q. And you and your brother were up on a
24 hill --
25 A. They weren’t always correct. Yeah, they had
26 clocks there, but they weren’t always correct.
27 Q. Well, if you didn’t know what time it was,
28 how do you know they weren’t correct. 1296
 

 
1 A. Because the clocks were -- one clock was
2 saying five o’clock and another clock was saying
3 nine o’clock. That’s how I knew they were wrong.
4 Q. Star, you knew what time it was at
5 Neverland, didn’t you.
6 A. No.
7 MR. SNEDDON: Object as argumentative, Your
8 Honor.
9 THE COURT: Sustained.
10 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Did you ever send letters
11 or cards to Michael Jackson.
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Do you know when you did that.
14 A. When we first met Michael.
15 Q. And approximately when was that again.
16 A. When I was 10, 11.
17 Q. And do you know approximately when you first
18 met Michael.
19 A. While my brother was having cancer.
20 Q. Was that probably the fall of 2000.
21 A. I don’t know the date.
22 Q. Was it 2001.
23 A. I don’t know the date.
24 Q. Was it 2002.
25 A. I just know it was between when my brother
26 was having cancer.
27 Q. Did your mother help you write your letters
28 to Michael. 1297
 

 
1 A. Hmm, no.
2 Q. Did you write them yourself.
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. You wrote a letter to Michael, Star, where
5 you said -- you thanked him, “Because even when your
6 hearts get broken and shattered into tiny little
7 pieces, we always still love, need and care about
8 you with every tiny little piece of our hearts,”
9 right.
10 A. Are you reading that from a card.
11 Q. I’m asking you if you remember saying
12 anything like that.
13 A. No.
14 Q. Never said it.
15 A. No.
16 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I show
17 you a card --
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. -- that you sent to Michael.
20 A. Yes.
21 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor.
22 THE COURT: Yes.
23 MR. SNEDDON: Your Honor, could I see the
24 card before counsel shows him.
25 MR. MESEREAU: Sure. My mistake.
26 MR. SNEDDON: That’s okay. My mistake; I
27 just didn’t....
28 MR. MESEREAU: May I have this marked as the 1298
 

 
1 exhibit next in order, Your Honor.
2 THE COURT: Yes.
3 MR. SNEDDON: Excuse me, Your Honor. If
4 he’s going to refresh the individual’s recollection
5 first, and that --
6 MR. MESEREAU: Excuse me, Your Honor, I’m
7 doing it.
8 THE COURT: He’s changed his --
9 MR. SNEDDON: I object.
10 THE COURT: He’s changed his approach.
11 MR. MESEREAU: I’m doing it.
12 THE COURT: He was going to refresh. Now
13 he’s asking if the exhibit may be marked. He can
14 have the exhibit marked.
15 MR. MESEREAU: Thank you, Your Honor.
16 THE CLERK: It’s 5001.
17 MR. MESEREAU: 5001.
18 MR. SNEDDON: No objection that it come in.
19 MR. MESEREAU: Your Honor, that would be a
20 card and an envelope. Would you like them to be two
21 exhibits or can they be the same.
22 THE COURT: I think they can be the same.
23 MR. MESEREAU: Okay. Thank you.
24 Q. Star, I’m going to show you a card and
25 envelope that have been marked as Exhibit 5001.
26 Okay.
27 A. I think I wrote this off another card.
28 Q. Okay. But you did write it, right. 1299
 

 
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. Have you seen that before.
3 A. I haven’t seen this in a long time.
4 Q. But that’s your handwriting, isn’t it.
5 A. Yes, when I was really little. Yes.
6 Q. And how about the envelope. Have you seen
7 that envelope, the purple envelope. Have you seen
8 that before.
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. That’s the envelope the card came in.
11 A. I don’t remember if the envelope came with
12 this card.
13 Q. Okay. And you gave Michael Jackson your
14 phone number, right, at the bottom.
15 A. Looks like it.
16 Q. Okay.
17 A. Wait. I don’t remember that being my phone
18 number. But if it is, it was.
19 MR. MESEREAU: I would move this document
20 into evidence, Your Honor.
21 MR. SNEDDON: I already said no objection,
22 Your Honor.
23 THE COURT: It’s admitted.
24 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: You said to Michael
25 Jackson, “My super, super, best, best friend,”
26 right.
27 A. Yes.
28 Q. You said, “I love you, I love you,” 1300
 

 
1 repeatedly, right.
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. And you referred to Father’s Day, right.
4 A. I didn’t read the card.
5 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I show
6 you the envelope.
7 A. Sure.
8 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor.
9 THE COURT: Yes.
10 THE WITNESS: “Happy Father’s Day.”
11 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Yeah, you said “Happy
12 Father’s Day” on the envelope, right.
13 A. Wait. Can I see it one more time.
14 Q. Sure.
15 May I.
16 THE COURT: Yes.
17 THE WITNESS: Sorry. Okay.
18 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: You sent the card on
19 Father’s Day, correct.
20 A. Sure. I don’t remember, but, okay.
21 Q. You told Mr. Jackson, “You always heal us in
22 a very special way,” right.
23 A. I wrote that off another card.
24 Q. What other card did you write that off of.
25 A. It was a card that already had it written on
26 there.
27 Q. Where did you get that card.
28 A. Probably from a supermarket or -- 1301
 

 
1 Q. Excuse me.
2 A. Probably from a supermarket.
3 Q. Okay. So you took a card from a
4 supermarket --
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. -- and wrote the words.
7 A. It was a card lying around. My grandmother
8 got a lot of cards from her grandchildren.
9 Q. You said, “Michael, you are special to us,”
10 right.
11 A. Okay.
12 Q. “We loyally and faithfully love you more,”
13 right.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. “We love you unconditionally, to infinity
16 and beyond forever,” right.
17 A. Okay.
18 Q. And you said, “Thank you, Michael, for being
19 our family,” right.
20 A. Okay.
21 Q. “Love, your Blow Hole, Star Arvizo,” right.
22 A. Okay.
23 Q. 626-452-1693, right.
24 A. I don’t even remember having that phone
25 number, but --
26 Q. The card is signed “Davellin, Gavin, Star
27 and me,” right.
28 A. “Me”. Okay. 1302
 

 
1 Q. Well, there’s other people’s writings on
2 there also, correct.
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. And you all used to write to Michael and
5 tell him about how he had healed your family, right.
6 A. What do you mean. We never -- we probably
7 wrote to him like --
8 Q. Pardon me.
9 A. I only wrote to him, like, three times.
10 Q. Okay. But you would write to him and tell
11 him how he had healed your family, true.
12 A. I don’t remember that.
13 Q. Your mother would ask you to do that, right.
14 A. No.
15 Q. And your family often referred to Michael as
16 a father figure, right.
17 A. Um, sure.
18 Q. You did that often, right.
19 A. Refer to him as a father figure.
20 Q. Yes. You always referred to Michael as
21 being part of your family, didn’t you.
22 A. Yes. Part of our family.
23 Q. Your mother used to do that, correct.
24 A. What do you mean.
25 Q. You don’t know what I mean.
26 A. No.
27 Q. Your mother used to refer to Michael Jackson
28 as being part of your family, didn’t she. 1303
 

 
1 MR. SNEDDON: Your Honor, I’m going to
2 object as to vague as to time.
3 MR. MESEREAU: I’ll rephrase it, Your Honor.
4 Q. From the time you first met Michael Jackson,
5 you used to refer to him as being part of your
6 family, didn’t you.
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. From the time your mother first met Michael
9 Jackson, she used to refer to him as being part of
10 your family, right.
11 A. I can’t speak for my mom.
12 Q. You never heard her say that.
13 A. Not really.
14 Q. From the time your sister first met Michael
15 Jackson, she used to refer to him as being part of
16 the family, right.
17 A. I don’t know.
18 Q. Did you ever hear her say that.
19 A. No.
20 Q. But you started doing it yourself, correct.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. And you say you did it by copying a card
23 from a supermarket.
24 A. Yes, I just plugged his name in.
25 Q. Okay. So this handwriting of yours all
26 comes from a supermarket card; is that correct.
27 A. No, not from a supermarket card. I rewrote
28 the supermarket card. 1304
 

 
1 Q. Okay. So when you said to Michael, “Thank
2 you, Michael, because even when our hearts are and
3 get broken and shattered into tiny little pieces, we
4 always still love, need and care about you with
5 every tiny little piece of our hearts, because you
6 always heal us in a very special way,” did you get
7 that from a supermarket card.
8 A. I plugged some words in, I plugged his name
9 in, and that’s how I got that paragraph.
10 Q. And you recall sending it to him.
11 A. What.
12 Q. Do you recall sending it to him.
13 A. Not really.
14 Q. Do you recall giving it to him.
15 A. Not really.
16 Q. Yesterday you told the jury that when you
17 were interviewed on that rebuttal tape and your
18 family said things about Michael healing Gavin and
19 being a father, that that was something scripted,
20 correct.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. But nobody scripted the words in this card,
23 did they.
24 A. No. But that was before all that happened.
25 Q. Before what happened, Star.
26 A. Before the Miami trip, and before we finally
27 left.
28 Q. So what you’re saying is before the Miami 1305
 

 
1 trip, you always, you and your family always
2 referred to Michael as “Daddy” and as someone who
3 would heal.
4 A. We never had a constant connection with
5 Michael during that time.
6 Q. Then why would you write a card like this to
7 him.
8 A. Probably when we came back from Neverland.
9 I don’t know. I was really little when I wrote that
10 card.
11 Q. Your mother asked you to write it, didn’t
12 she.
13 A. No.
14 Q. Your mother never asked you to write to
15 Michael.
16 A. No.
17 Q. Your mother -- how old were you when you
18 wrote the card; do you think.
19 A. Probably -- I don’t know. I don’t know.
20 Q. Well, how old do you think you were. Ten.
21 Nine.
22 A. I can’t guess. I don’t know.
23 Q. Well, how old are you now.
24 A. 14.
25 Q. We’re talking about a couple of years ago,
26 right.
27 A. I don’t know. I don’t want to say the wrong
28 age. 1306
 

 
1 Q. Pardon me.
2 A. I don’t want to say the wrong age.
3 Q. No, just do your best. Just estimate.
4 We’re talking about a couple of years ago, correct.
5 A. No.
6 Q. Huh.
7 A. No.
8 Q. Well, how long ago do you think you were
9 visiting Neverland.
10 A. Back in 2000 and 2001.
11 Q. All right. How old do you think you were in
12 2000 and 2001.
13 A. Ten.
14 Q. Are you saying that when you were ten years
15 old nobody told you what words to write on this
16 card.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. You wrote it all yourself when you were ten.
19 A. No, the card helped me.
20 Q. Well, what about the words, “When we get
21 broken and shattered into tiny little pieces we
22 always still love, need and care about you with
23 every tiny little piece of our hearts, because you
24 always heal us in a very special way”. Did you make
25 those words up at the age of 10.
26 A. No, the card did.
27 Q. The card did.
28 A. Yes. The card already had them written on 1307
 

 
1 there.
2 Q. Oh, I see, so you took a card and copied it.
3 A. Yes, I told you.
4 Q. And your mother wasn’t involved in that.
5 A. No.
6 Q. And your father wasn’t involved in that.
7 A. No.
8 Q. And Gavin wasn’t involved in that.
9 A. No.
10 Q. And Davellin wasn’t involved in that, right.
11 A. No.
12 Q. You did it all yourself, right.
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Then how come you got other family members
15 writing on the same card.
16 A. Well, they probably wrote on the card after
17 I was done with it.
18 Q. Did you see them do that.
19 A. No, I just wrote on it, and I left it there.
20 Q. Are you saying they probably did that, or
21 you know they did that.
22 A. They probably did that.
23 Q. Okay. But what you’re telling the jury -
24 and correct me if I’m wrong - is long before the
25 rebuttal video, your family was referring to Michael
26 as “Daddy,” and as someone who had healed the
27 family, true.
28 MR. SNEDDON: Object, Your Honor, as 1308
 

 
1 compound.
2 MR. MESEREAU: I’ll rephrase it, Your Honor.
3 I think it is compound.
4 THE COURT: All right.
5 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Long before the rebuttal
6 film, your family was referring to Michael as a
7 father figure, right.
8 A. It was long before the Miami trip, too.
9 Q. You say long before it.
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Well, in the year --
12 A. And --
13 Q. Pardon me.
14 A. And my brother was referring to him as a
15 father figure.
16 Q. Okay. Long before the Miami trip, correct.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And long before the Miami trip, your mother
19 was referring to him as a father figure, right.
20 A. My brother.
21 Q. Is that true.
22 A. Yes, my brother needed a father at that
23 time. He was barely coming out of his terminal
24 illness.
25 Q. And long before the Miami trip, you were
26 referring to Michael Jackson as a father figure,
27 right.
28 A. I don’t remember doing it, but okay. 1309
 

 
1 Q. Well, did you do that.
2 A. No.
3 Q. Pardon me.
4 A. No.
5 Q. You didn’t do it.
6 A. No.
7 Q. What about the card.
8 A. So. That’s what -- that’s what the card had
9 on it, so I -- I rewrit it on a piece of paper
10 and -- and I plugged in his name.
11 Q. Now, “Blow Hole” was a nickname for a fish,
12 right.
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Your nickname was based on a fish, right.
15 A. I made it up. I was going to give it to
16 Michael. We had a rock/paper/scissors, I lost, so I
17 got stuck with that name.
18 Q. Okay. Do you remember meeting with
19 Psychologist Stanley Katz to talk about what you
20 claim Michael Jackson did to your mother. Do you
21 remember that.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. You told Stanley Katz that Michael Jackson
24 gave you red wine and vodka, correct.
25 A. I don’t remember saying that.
26 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I show
27 you his testimony.
28 A. Whose testimony. 1310
 

 
1 Q. Stanley Katz.
2 A. I never said that to him, so --
3 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I just
4 show you what he says you told him.
5 A. That’s what he said.
6 Q. Okay. Would it refresh your recollection if
7 I just show you what he said.
8 A. Okay, but it’s not going to help.
9 Q. It’s not going to help you.
10 A. Yeah, I remember saying red and white wine,
11 and there’s one time we got vodka, yes.
12 Q. You told Stanley Katz that you were given
13 vodka.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. But yesterday you told the jury it was just
16 wine, right.
17 A. I forgot.
18 Q. You might have forgot yesterday.
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Okay. You told Stanley Katz that the first
21 time you observed your brother in bed with Michael
22 Jackson, that Michael Jackson had put his hand on
23 your brother’s crotch, right.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. You then changed that to say he had put his
26 hand inside your brother’s pants, right.
27 A. He might have said it, but I know what I
28 said. 1311
 

 
1 Q. Excuse me. I’m sorry.
2 A. Repeat the question.
3 Q. Originally, you told Stanley Katz that
4 Michael Jackson had put his hand near your brother’s
5 crotch, right.
6 A. Near.
7 Q. Yes.
8 A. Okay.
9 Q. Is that right.
10 A. No.
11 Q. Well, you said he put his hand on his
12 crotch, correct.
13 A. In his underwears.
14 Q. And as time went on, after interview and
15 after interview, you changed that to masturbation,
16 true.
17 A. Masturbating my brother.
18 Q. Let me rephrase it.
19 A. Okay.
20 Q. You told Stanley Katz that the first time
21 you saw Michael Jackson in bed with your brother,
22 the time you went up the stairs, that Michael
23 Jackson had put his hand on your brother’s crotch,
24 right.
25 A. When they were going up the stairs.
26 Q. Yes.
27 A. While they were going up the stairs.
28 Q. While you’re going up the stairs. 1312
 

 
1 A. Okay.
2 Q. Let me rephrase it. Don’t answer it if
3 you’re confused. Okay.
4 A. Okay.
5 Q. You told the jury yesterday you went up the
6 stairs one night, right.
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. You got into the room yourself, right.
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. You said the bell went off, right.
11 A. When I first walked in through the hallway,
12 yes.
13 Q. And even though the bell went off, you kept
14 going up the stairs, right.
15 A. The bell went off while I was -- made my way
16 through the hallway.
17 Q. The bell went off when you opened the door,
18 didn’t it.
19 A. No, it stopped.
20 Q. Pardon me.
21 A. It stopped.
22 Q. It just stopped.
23 A. Yeah. It goes for a couple more minutes and
24 then it stops.
25 Q. And then what happens.
26 A. That’s it.
27 Q. It never goes on again.
28 A. No. 1313
 

 
1 Q. It goes off so Michael can hear it, correct.
2 A. If the door’s closed, you can’t hear
3 nothing.
4 Q. Can’t hear anything upstairs.
5 A. No.
6 Q. Is that what you’re saying.
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Okay. The bell goes off. You say Michael
9 doesn’t hear it, right.
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. And you say that you open his door to the
12 stairway, right, and you say you go upstairs, right.
13 A. Okay.
14 Q. The first one you say you describe that to
15 was Stanley Katz, correct.
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. You told Stanley Katz that Michael Jackson
18 had his left hand on Gavin’s crotch, right.
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Never told him that Michael Jackson was
21 masturbating Gavin.
22 A. He wasn’t masturbating. He was just
23 feeling.
24 Q. He was just feeling him.
25 A. Yes.
26 Q. Do you remember yesterday you told the jury
27 he was masturbating him.
28 A. No, I said Michael was feeling my brother 1314
 

 
1 while he was masturbating.
2 Q. Okay. Did you ever tell the jury yesterday
3 that Michael was masturbating your brother.
4 A. No.
5 Q. Did you ever tell that to anybody.
6 A. No.
7 Q. Okay. Do you remember when you described
8 for Stanley Katz the second time you claim Michael
9 Jackson was observed by you in bed with your
10 brother. Do you remember that.
11 A. What.
12 Q. Do you remember telling Stanley Katz there
13 was a second time that you went up the stairs and
14 observed Michael Jackson touching your brother.
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Did you tell Stanley Katz that Michael
17 Jackson had his hand on your brother’s crotch.
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. That’s really not what you told him at all,
20 is it.
21 A. What are you talking about.
22 Q. Well, you told Stanley Katz that Michael
23 Jackson was rubbing his penis against Gavin’s
24 buttocks, didn’t you.
25 A. When. The second time.
26 Q. Yes. Did you tell Stanley Katz that.
27 A. No.
28 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I show 1315
 

 
1 you his grand jury testimony.
2 A. I know what I said, though.
3 Q. Are you denying telling Psychologist Stanley
4 Katz --
5 A. The second time.
6 Q. -- that you told him the second time you
7 observed Michael Jackson touching your brother in
8 bed, that Michael Jackson was rubbing his penis
9 against your brother’s buttocks.
10 A. No.
11 Q. You never told that to Stanley Katz.
12 A. No.
13 Q. If I showed you his testimony, would that
14 jog your memory.
15 A. No. I know what I said, though.
16 Q. Okay. You tried to tell Stanley Katz that
17 you smelled marijuana, didn’t you.
18 A. I don’t know how marijuana smells.
19 Q. Didn’t you tell Stanley Katz you smelled
20 marijuana.
21 A. No.
22 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I show
23 you that page of his testimony.
24 A. No.
25 Q. Okay. Now, are you saying that you never
26 told Michael Jackson you wanted to be an actor.
27 A. No.
28 Q. Never told him that at all, right. 1316
 

 
1 A. No.
2 Q. Okay. To your knowledge, did your mother
3 ever tell Michael Jackson you wanted to be an actor.
4 A. I can’t speak for her.
5 Q. Did you ever hear her say that.
6 A. No.
7 Q. You went to dancing classes, right.
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. And what school did you go to.
10 A. I went to Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy’s Dance
11 Studio. I went to -- where else did I go. I went
12 to ballet classes, rhythm/tap, a little bit of jazz.
13 What else. That’s it.
14 Q. And you went to comedy class, right.
15 A. Sure. Yes.
16 Q. When did you go to comedy class.
17 A. In the summer. In the summer.
18 Q. What summer was that.
19 A. In between third and fourth.
20 Q. Were you trying to learn to be a comedian.
21 A. No, I just wanted to do it for fun.
22 Q. Okay. Ever tell anyone you wanted to be a
23 comedian.
24 A. No.
25 Q. Okay. Now, you told the Santa Barbara
26 Sheriffs that Frank threatened you and your family,
27 right.
28 A. He just threatened me. 1317
 

 
1 Q. He just threatened you alone.
2 A. He probably threatened my family.
3 Q. Did he threaten you alone.
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Do you know when that was.
6 A. I don’t know the date.
7 Q. Was it when you first got to Neverland.
8 A. I don’t really remember.
9 Q. Was it after the Miami trip.
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Do you know how soon after the Miami trip.
12 A. I think it was right before the rebuttal.
13 Q. Right before the rebuttal.
14 A. I was trying to go talk to my mom.
15 Q. So this would be before, if I represent to
16 you the rebuttal was June 20th, right.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Excuse me, February 20th, pardon me.
19 February 20th was the rebuttal tape, right.
20 A. Okay.
21 Q. And you’re saying that Frank threatened you
22 right before the rebuttal tape.
23 A. While I was trying to walk to my mom’s guest
24 unit.
25 Q. Okay. But it was -- as far as you know,
26 it’s before the rebuttal tape, right.
27 A. Yes.
28 Q. Okay. And in one of your sheriffs’ 1318
 

 
1 interviews, you were asked why Frank made that
2 threat, right.
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. And you told the sheriffs, “Because he
5 already knew that what Michael did to us, and if we
6 told them the truth, he would have went to jail,”
7 right.
8 A. Can I read that.
9 Q. Yes.
10 May I approach, Your Honor.
11 THE COURT: Yes.
12 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Have you had a chance to
13 look at that page.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Do you remember saying that to the sheriffs.
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. And you told them, essentially, that Frank
18 said that to you, threatened you, because he knew
19 that if you told anybody what Michael had done,
20 Michael would go to jail, right.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. That was right before the rebuttal tape,
23 right.
24 A. I think so, yes.
25 Q. Have you discussed the charges in this case
26 with the sheriffs.
27 A. No.
28 Q. Have they told you they’re claiming that 1319
 

 
1 molestation went on starting the 20th of June.
2 A. Okay.
3 Q. February, I mean. Have they told you that.
4 A. Okay. No, they haven’t told me.
5 Q. Did you ever give them dates.
6 A. No. I knew more back then than I do now.
7 Q. You knew more back then than you do now.
8 A. Yes, it was fresh in my memory back then.
9 Q. Did someone tell you to say that.
10 A. No, I’m saying it right now, because I have
11 school, I have tests to study for, and most of that
12 stuff leave my memory, most of the details.
13 Q. That’s because you’re studying for tests in
14 school.
15 A. Yes. Yes.
16 Q. And you think if you weren’t studying for
17 tests in school, you’d know a lot more today.
18 A. It’s not just tests. It’s just learning.
19 Q. So the learning you’ve done in school has
20 interfered with your memory about this case.
21 A. No, I know -- I know -- I know everything
22 happened. I just don’t know it in detail like I did
23 in those testimonies.
24 Q. Okay. Okay. You had a lot of details
25 yesterday, didn’t you.
26 A. Well, yeah. I do remember details. But not
27 all the details.
28 Q. Okay. But you said you’ve reviewed a 1320
 

 
1 transcript of your police interview, right.
2 A. Yes. I didn’t memorize 300 pages.
3 Q. They told you to memorize it.
4 A. No, I’m just telling you I didn’t memorize
5 them. I just read through them.
6 Q. Now, where did you get 300 pages.
7 A. I’m just saying, I’m just giving you an
8 example.
9 Q. Please tell the jury how many pages you were
10 mailed to review before you testified.
11 A. I didn’t count them.
12 Q. Do you know approximately how many.
13 A. No.
14 Q. Didn’t you just say 300.
15 A. I was showing you an example.
16 Q. Okay. And when did you get these pages,
17 however many there were.
18 A. When did I get them.
19 Q. Yes.
20 A. About a month ago.
21 Q. Do you know where they came from.
22 A. No.
23 Q. No idea.
24 A. No.
25 Q. They just popped up in the mail.
26 A. Yes.
27 Q. And when you got them, what did you do.
28 A. I didn’t read them. 1321
 

 
1 Q. Where did you put them.
2 A. Put them right near my bed.
3 Q. Never looked at them again.
4 A. No. Until -- until I almost came up here.
5 Q. So when you almost came up here, you looked
6 at those pages for the first time, right.
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. And how many of them did you look at.
9 A. How many.
10 Q. Yeah. Roughly.
11 A. I don’t know.
12 Q. Did you look at all of them.
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Did someone tell you to read them.
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Who.
17 A. Tom.
18 Q. Prosecutor Sneddon.
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Told you to read all the pages, right.
21 A. Yes. Just to look through them.
22 Q. Told you to read them, to get ready for your
23 testimony in this case, right.
24 A. Yes. Just to look through them.
25 Q. And that’s how you knew your sentence to the
26 sheriffs about AOL dropped off and wasn’t completed,
27 right.
28 A. I didn’t know about that. 1322
 

 
1 Q. You didn’t know about that.
2 A. No.
3 Q. Didn’t you just testify about that.
4 A. I said I read through them.
5 Q. Read through what.
6 A. My transcripts.
7 Q. Okay. You read through them because
8 Prosecutor Sneddon wanted you to make sure that you
9 testified consistently with what you had in the
10 reports, right.
11 A. Okay.
12 Q. Is that what he said.
13 A. No. He just told me to thumb through them,
14 to look through them.
15 Q. He told you just to thumb through them.
16 A. No, just to look through them.
17 Q. Okay. Now, when did he do this.
18 A. Hmm, about a month ago.
19 Q. Did you do what he asked you to do.
20 A. No. I had school to concentrate on. I had
21 a final.
22 Q. Okay. So you didn’t do what Prosecutor
23 Sneddon asked you to do; isn’t that correct.
24 A. I eventually did it.
25 Q. Eventually you did. And can you just tell
26 us when.
27 A. What.
28 Q. Can you just tell us when you eventually did 1323
 

 
1 what Prosecutor Sneddon asked you to do.
2 A. Four weeks after he told me, or three weeks.
3 Q. Okay. And was that in the last month.
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. So you read all the documents you were sent
6 by Prosecutor Sneddon, right.
7 A. Yes. I didn’t memorize them. I just read
8 them and -- yeah.
9 Q. Well, did anyone tell you to memorize them.
10 A. No, I’m telling you I didn’t memorize all
11 those pages.
12 Q. Okay. Do you remember telling the Santa
13 Barbara Sheriffs that there’s a big telescope on a
14 hill at Neverland that you and Gavin used to look
15 through.
16 A. We looked through once or twice, yes.
17 Q. And describe for the jury where that
18 telescope is, if you would.
19 A. It’s on a hill right before you enter the --
20 the second gate into the ranch.
21 Q. And from that hill, can you get a view of
22 Neverland.
23 A. Yes. You can also view into a guest unit.
24 Q. And you told the sheriffs that you and Gavin
25 used to look through that telescope into the guest
26 units, right.
27 A. Yes, we saw into one guest unit where my mom
28 was staying. 1324
 

 
1 Q. Okay. So you used to kind of look at your
2 mom through the telescope, right.
3 A. No, no, we just -- we were looking and we
4 saw a guest unit, and then we continued looking
5 somewhere else.
6 Q. Did you look into the window of that guest
7 unit.
8 A. Yes. Yes.
9 Q. And that’s where your mom was, right.
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. You saw your mom, right.
12 A. All you saw was her television and her bed.
13 But you didn’t -- you saw like a part of her bed.
14 You didn’t see her complete bed.
15 Q. Did you see her in the unit.
16 A. No.
17 Q. But your testimony was that your mom never
18 came out of the guest quarters, right.
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Do you remember -- strike that.
21 Did you ever see your mom dancing with
22 Michael Jackson.
23 A. No.
24 Q. Did you ever go into the theater with
25 your -- with Michael Jackson and your mom.
26 A. I went in the theater a lot of times.
27 Q. Did you ever go into the theater with your
28 mom, Michael, Davellin and Gavin. 1325
 

 
1 A. Yes, to watch a movie.
2 Q. And how often did you do that.
3 A. My mom rarely came out.
4 Q. Well, but you just said -- first you said
5 she never went out. Then you admitted you’d been in
6 the theater with her, right.
7 A. I was thinking about something else.
8 Q. Okay.
9 A. You kind of got it mixed into my memory.
10 Q. Okay. I don’t want to mix you up.
11 First you said your mom never came out of
12 the guest cottage, right.
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. And then you admitted she’d been in the
15 theater with Michael and the family, right.
16 A. And I told you that my memories got mixed in
17 and I said something else.
18 Q. Okay. I’m just trying to find out what the
19 truth is, if I can.
20 A. Okay.
21 Q. You said you were in the theater with your
22 mom, Michael, Gavin and Davellin, right.
23 A. Yes. But then I said after that, that no,
24 she wasn’t, because she wasn’t.
25 Q. Okay. So your mom never was in the theater
26 you’re saying now, right.
27 A. She probably was, but I wasn’t there. I
28 just remember going in there and watching movies. 1326
 

 
1 Q. All right. Now, the telescope on the hill
2 is a telescope that you and your brother used to
3 look through, correct.
4 A. It was twice we looked through the
5 telescope.
6 Q. And does the telescope move.
7 A. Yes. Moves in all directions.
8 Q. And if you take that telescope, you can see
9 the clocks at Neverland, can’t you.
10 A. Okay.
11 Q. Can you.
12 A. Trees were in the way.
13 Q. Trees are in the way.
14 A. Yes. There’s a lot of trees at Neverland.
15 Q. You can’t see one clock from that telescope.
16 A. Which clock are you referring to.
17 Q. Any of them.
18 A. There was, like, two clocks right beside
19 each other and a clock way over there by the
20 carnival. You can see the hands on that clock.
21 Q. That’s the clock by the carnival.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And you said there are two other clocks you
24 mentioned.
25 A. Well, there’s one big clock.
26 Q. Right. One big clock.
27 A. Yes.
28 Q. Can you see that through the telescope. 1327
 

 
1 A. No.
2 Q. What clocks can you see through the
3 telescope.
4 A. The one by the carnival, but it’s too small
5 to look through. I mean, it’s too small to see the
6 hands moving.
7 Q. What about the big flower clock --
8 A. Okay.
9 Q. -- on the hill that overlooks Neverland.
10 Can you see that through the telescope.
11 A. No, the trees are in the way.
12 Q. You’re sure of that.
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Did you try to do it.
15 A. Not really. We were looking; we just wanted
16 to look through it. We weren’t trying to look for
17 time. We were just looking through it, because --
18 because it was up there, so we were just trying to
19 look through it.
20 Q. You’re making up that trees block your view
21 through the telescope, aren’t you --
22 A. I’m just saying --
23 Q. -- Star.
24 A. -- I never really expected to look for a
25 clock. I just looked through it. I remember trees
26 and probably -- yeah. I remember trees, but I never
27 really -- the telescope was up there, so me and my
28 brother tried to look through it. 1328
 

 
1 Q. Why did you just tell the jury that trees
2 prevent you from seeing clocks through the telescope
3 on the hill that overlooks Neverland.
4 A. What does it matter. I mean, even when
5 you’re down there, you can see the clock. When
6 you’re driving the car. I don’t know what you’re
7 trying to get at.
8 Q. What else have you seen through that
9 telescope on the hill that overlooks Neverland.
10 A. Rides. And trees.
11 Q. What else.
12 A. And the guest unit.
13 Q. What else.
14 A. Hills.
15 Q. Can you see the theater.
16 A. Never really tried to see the theater.
17 Q. Can you see the main house.
18 A. Probably. I don’t know. I never really
19 tried.
20 Q. Well, did you and your brother take that
21 telescope and look all over Neverland on that hill
22 with the telescope that you’ve described moves.
23 A. It’s -- okay.
24 Q. Did you look all over Neverland at that --
25 through that moving telescope.
26 A. No, we just looked through it. We didn’t
27 try to examine the whole Neverland.
28 Q. How far away, if you know, is the guest unit 1329
 

 
1 from that telescope, if you know.
2 A. I don’t know, but I could guess.
3 Q. But you say you were up there only twice
4 with your brother, right.
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Do you know what time of day that was.
7 A. Daylight. Daytime.
8 Q. Okay. And certainly you’ve been to
9 Neverland at night, right.
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Have you noticed that these clocks are lit
12 up at night.
13 A. The flower clock.
14 Q. Any of them.
15 A. Sure.
16 Q. You’ve noticed they’re lit up at night,
17 haven’t you.
18 A. I just noticed that the train station is lit
19 up, and so is the flower clock. I can’t -- there’s
20 the flower clock overlooking Neverland. Not
21 overlooking. It’s right there.
22 Q. Right up on a hill above the main house,
23 correct.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. You’ve seen that clock lit at night, true.
26 A. I don’t remember if it was lit, but it was
27 probably lit, yeah.
28 Q. Well, why do you tell the jury it was 1330
 

 
1 probably lit.
2 A. I don’t know. I’m trying to remember.
3 THE COURT: Is this a good place to stop,
4 Counsel.
