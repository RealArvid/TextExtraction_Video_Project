5 THE COURT: Good morning.
6 COUNSEL AT COUNSEL TABLE: (In unison)
7 Good morning, Your Honor. Good morning, Your Honor.
8 THE JURY: (In unison) Good morning.
9 THE COURT: I told you that when I knew that
10 we were going to have a day that you weren’t going
11 to be here, I would let you know as soon as I could.
12 And I’m going to do that right now.
13 BAILIFF CORTEZ: I’m sorry, Judge, they
14 can’t hear you in the back, sir.
15 THE COURT: That’s because my microphone’s
16 off.
17 Next Friday, not this Friday, the 11th of
18 March, the jury will not come in. We are going to
19 have a day just of motions outside the presence of
20 the jury. So we’ve set up a whole day to do that.
21 And that will give you a nice break.
22 In addition to that, on Tuesday, next
23 week -- I don’t have the date in front of me.
24 THE CLERK: It would be the 8th.
25 THE COURT: The 8th, we’re going to stop one
26 hour early. And I have a meeting that afternoon, so
27 we’ll go to -- we’ll probably go to close to 12:00
28 and then stop. So it’s not a day off, but it’s an 533
 

 
1 afternoon off, I guess you’d say.
2 All right. Those are the only times right
3 now that I know that I can give to you.
4 Let’s see, where were you. Are you ready to
5 proceed.
6 Do you want me to show the screen now.
7 MR. SNEDDON: I have a few questions first,
8 Your Honor. But we are going to use the DVD player,
9 so we can alert the Court to that.

12 Having been previously sworn, resumed the
13 stand and testified further as follows:
14
15 DIRECT EXAMINATION (Continued)
16 BY MR. SNEDDON:
17 Q. Good morning.
18 A. Good morning.
19 Q. Deputy Lafferty, you told the ladies and
20 gentlemen of the jury yesterday that you were
21 involved in the execution of the search warrant on
22 Neverland Ranch on the 18th of November, 2003,
23 correct.
24 A. That’s correct.
25 Q. Now, can you tell the ladies and gentlemen
26 of the jury, what time was it when you arrived on
27 the ranch that morning.
28 A. I arrived on the ranch property at 534
 

 
1 approximately 9:07 that morning.
2 Q. And I think you told us yesterday one of
3 your main responsibilities was to photograph the
4 interior of the main residence; is that correct.
5 A. To videotape the --
6 Q. Videotape.
7 A. That’s correct.
8 Q. And did you keep time -- track of the time
9 in which you actually started your responsibilities
10 of videotaping the inside of the residence.
11 A. Yes, I did.
12 Q. Did you note that in a report.
13 A. Yes, I did.
14 Q. And what time was it that you started the
15 video of the interior of the main residence at
16 Neverland Valley Ranch.
17 A. I would have to look on my report to find
18 the exact --
19 Q. Do you have it with you.
20 A. I do have a copy of it.
21 Q. All right. Go ahead. See if that refreshes
22 your recollection.
23 A. At approximately 0955 hours I began the
24 video of the main residence.
25 Q. Now, later that same day, were you assigned
26 responsibilities in connection with documenting the
27 status of the inside of the interior when the
28 sheriff’s department left. 535
 

 
1 A. Yes, I was.
2 Q. Would you explain to the ladies and
3 gentlemen of the jury what your responsibilities
4 were.
5 A. It’s basically the same as I had done the
6 prewarrant service video. I retraced my steps the
7 same way, going back through the residence, showing
8 the condition of the residence after the search had
9 been completed.
10 Q. And do you recall what time you started
11 doing that particular video documentary.
12 A. If I could refer to my report for --
13 Q. Please. If you could.
14 A. At approximately 8:40 p.m., I was told that
15 the search had been completed in the main residence,
16 with the exception of the master bedroom area, and I
17 began the video of the residence at that time.
18 Q. Now, at some point that evening, did you
19 actually go up and video-document the main bedroom.
20 A. Yes, I did.
21 Q. The defendant’s bedroom.
22 A. Yes, I did.
23 Q. What time did that start.
24 A. That was at approximately 10:38 p.m.
25 Q. And do you have in your notes the time that
26 you actually finished that project.
27 A. Yes, I do.
28 Q. What was that. 536
 

 
1 A. That was at 10:55 p.m.
2 Q. Now, after you left the defendant’s bedroom,
3 did you do any more video-documenting before you
4 left the house.
5 A. Yes, I did.
6 Q. Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of
7 the jury what it was you did.
8 A. Prior to leaving the residence, I went back
9 into the dining room, I believe what would be the
10 formal dining room area of the residence, and
11 videotaped copies of the search warrant and the
12 property, itemized list of the items that were taken
13 from the residence during the search warrant. They
14 were laid out on the dining room table and videoed
15 the fact that they had been left at the residence.
16 Q. Were there people actually present when you
17 did that.
18 A. Yes, there were.
19 Q. Who was present, to your knowledge.
20 A. I believe it was Sergeant Robel and
21 Lieutenant Klapakis.
22 Q. Were there any representatives of Mr.
23 Jackson there.
24 A. Yes, there were.
25 Q. Do you remember her name, or their name.
26 A. I believe her name was Violet. I don’t
27 recall the last name.
28 Q. Okay. And then did you prepare a report 537
 

 
1 documenting the times at which you performed the
2 various functions you’ve told the ladies and
3 gentlemen of the jury about.
4 A. Yes, I did.
5 Q. You incorporated that into an official Santa
6 Barbara Sheriff’s Department report.
7 A. Yes, I did.
8 Q. Now, with regard to the film that you took
9 on the occasion of the 18th, what did you do with
10 that film.
11 A. That evening, when I returned to the
12 station, it was secured in a locked locker within
13 our forensics unit property area. And then at a
14 later date, it was booked into evidence.
15 MR. SNEDDON: Your Honor, I have an exhibit
16 which I’ve had marked -- premarked, with the help of
17 the court clerk, as 336. It’s a DVD. And counsel
18 has a copy of it, but -- may I approach the witness
19 for just a second with this, Your Honor.
20 THE COURT: Yes.
21 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: I’m going to stay here
22 because I’m going to ask you a few questions and
23 walk back.
24 The particular exhibit marked as 336, the
25 DVD inside of that container there, have you had an
26 occasion to view that before you came to court.
27 A. Yes, I did.
28 Q. Does that contain the product of your 538
 

 
1 walk-through of the ranch on the 18th of November of
2 2003.
3 A. Yes, it does.
4 Q. All right.
5 MR. SNEDDON: Move that People’s Exhibit 336
6 be admitted into evidence.
7 MR. SANGER: No objection, Your Honor.
8 THE COURT: All right. It’s admitted.
9 MR. SNEDDON: Your Honor, I propose to play
10 this for the jury now, with the Court’s permission.
11 THE COURT: All right. How long is it.
12 MR. SNEDDON: It’s, I would say, 12 minutes,
13 something like that. Between ten and 12 minutes,
14 Your Honor.
15 THE COURT: Thank you.
16 MR. SNEDDON: And -- don’t start it.
17 With the Court’s permission, we may stop it
18 from time to time to ask the officer a comment on
19 certain locations.
20 THE COURT: Of course.
21 MR. SNEDDON: Can you do that.
22 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
23 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
24 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Now, Deputy Lafferty, what
25 is being depicted on the scene up there on the
26 screen right now.
27 A. This is the view from just outside the main
28 entry door of the main residence on the ranch. 539
 

 
1 MR. SNEDDON: All right. Go ahead.
2 Your Honor, for purposes of the record, when
3 we stop it, we have a recorder, we can reference the
4 point on the tape for the Court for the record.
5 Would that be appropriate.
6 THE COURT: You may do that.
7 MR. SNEDDON: This would be at 00.17. Thank
8 you. Go ahead.
9 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
10 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
11 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Now, Detective Lafferty, do
12 you recognize the area on the video where we’ve
13 stopped it at this point.
14 A. Yes, I do.
15 Q. And what is that.
16 A. This is just inside of the main door,
17 looking to the right as you would face the door from
18 the exterior. And it’s a view looking down the
19 hallway towards the master bedroom area.
20 MR. SNEDDON: This would be at 00.29. All
21 right. Go ahead.
22 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
23 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
24 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Now, do you recognize
25 what’s at the still at this particular point on the
26 documentary.
27 A. Yes, I do.
28 Q. What’s that. 540
 

 
1 A. This is an area that had a large number of
2 items in reference to where it is in the residence.
3 It’s -- as you enter through the front door, if you
4 would proceed straight through the foyer to that,
5 and then turn to the left.
6 MR. SNEDDON: Okay. That’s at 00.39. Go
7 ahead.
8 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
9 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
10 MR. SNEDDON: Stop it right there.
11 Q. Now, we’re at a point on the video, which is
12 01.40. Can you tell us what this shows.
13 A. This is the hallway leading from the foyer
14 area towards the master bedroom.
15 Q. Do you see in this photograph the master
16 bedroom doors.
17 A. There’s a small portion of it visible, yes.
18 Q. Would you show that to the ladies and
19 gentlemen of the jury.
20 A. It’s the dark brown door here to the -- to
21 the right of the screen.
22 MR. SNEDDON: All right. Go ahead.
23 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
24 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
25 MR. SNEDDON: Stop.
26 Q. Now, we’re at 01.44. Could you tell the
27 ladies and gentlemen of the jury what’s depicted
28 here. 541
 

 
1 A. This is a view looking down. It’s just the
2 inside of the door, the prior stop, the master
3 bedroom door, just inside there.
4 Q. So we’re at the entrance of the master
5 bedroom.
6 A. Just inside of that, yes.
7 MR. SNEDDON: All right. Go ahead.
8 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
9 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
10 MR. SNEDDON: All right. Stop.
11 Q. All right. Deputy Lafferty, we’re at 02.19
12 on the video. What is depicted where we stopped it.
13 A. This is a staircase leading up to the bed
14 area and the master bedroom.
15 Q. We’re still inside the suite, the bedroom
16 area.
17 A. That’s correct.
18 MR. SNEDDON: Go ahead. Play it.
19 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
20 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
21 MR. SNEDDON: All right. Go ahead. Keep
22 going. All right. Stop it there.
23 Q. Now, we’re at a point on the video which is
24 03.07. Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of
25 the jury where you’re located approximately in the
26 bedroom at this point.
27 A. This is just up at the top landing of the
28 stairs starting to turn to the right. 542
 

 
1 MR. SNEDDON: All right. Go ahead.
2 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
3 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
4 MR. SNEDDON: Stop.
5 Q. Now, we’re at a point at four -- 04.48. Can
6 you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury where
7 we are in that particular portion of the house at
8 this point in the video documentary.
9 A. This is still in the master bedroom suite
10 back down on the first level. Just inside, actually
11 behind us, would be the main entry door, just
12 starting to go towards the left.
13 MR. SNEDDON: All right. Go ahead.
14 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
15 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
16 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: All right. Deputy, could
17 you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury where
18 we are at this point.
19 A. This is the doorway leading into the master
20 bedroom/bath area.
21 MR. SNEDDON: And this is at 05.14. All
22 right. Go ahead.
23 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
24 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
25 MR. SNEDDON: All right. Stop it.
26 Q. Now, where are we on the documentary at this
27 point.
28 A. This is just exiting the bathroom area back 543
 

 
1 into a sitting area, which is the first room you
2 come into as you enter the master bedroom suite.
3 MR. SNEDDON: All right. We’re at 06.54.
4 Go ahead.
5 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
6 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
7 MR. SNEDDON: Stop.
8 Q. Now, Deputy Lafferty, with regard to the
9 documentation of the search of Neverland Valley
10 Ranch on November 18th, did you also have other
11 responsibilities after you had completed the video
12 documentary.
13 A. Yes, I did.
14 Q. What was that.
15 A. To assist Detective Clark in taking still
16 photographs of items that was requested by the
17 searching people at the location.
18 Q. Would you describe to the ladies and
19 gentlemen of the jury how that process worked.
20 A. We stood by and the people who -- when the
21 warrant was executed, there were different teams
22 that were assigned to search various locations.
23 When those people would conduct a search and find an
24 item that they would like to have documented, they
25 would contact us, and we would go and take still
26 photographs of that item before it was collected.
27 Q. When you say to the ladies and gentlemen of
28 the jury “before it was collected,” does that mean 544
 

 
1 where it is before it’s either touched or picked up.
2 A. To the best of our knowledge, yes.
3 Q. And then you would take a photograph of
4 that.
5 A. That’s correct.
6 Q. And with regard to the area that we’ve just
7 seen in the photograph that you’ve described as the
8 master bedroom and the - the first floor and second
9 floor, okay. - were you involved in
10 photo-documenting the location of items that were
11 taken from this particular area of the house.
12 A. There were only a few items that I took
13 photographs of. The majority of that was done by
14 Detective Clark.
15 Q. So there were two of you there doing that.
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. But you were responsible for taking some of
18 the photographs.
19 All right. Go ahead. Move on.
20 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
21 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
22 Q. Let’s stop right here. That’s a good place
23 right away. Do you recognize this room.
24 A. Yes, I do.
25 Q. Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen what
26 this room is, where it’s located in the house
27 generally.
28 A. This room was a room that we refer to as the 545
 

 
1 doll room. It consists of a lot of dolls in there.
2 It’s located on the second level of the main
3 residence outside of the master suite. As you enter
4 the end of the foyer, there was a staircase to the
5 right-hand side as you followed the stairs up.
6 When you reached the second story, you went
7 to the left side, which the room is located on
8 the -- what would be the northwest area of the
9 floor.
10 MR. SNEDDON: All right. Go ahead.
11 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
12 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
13 MR. SNEDDON: All right. Stop.
14 Q. Now, we’ve obviously moved into another
15 room. And we’ve stopped it at 08.14. Could you
16 tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what this
17 particular room is.
18 A. This is a room that we referred to as the
19 toy room. It is located off of what we referred to
20 as the doll room. It would be on the west side of
21 that location. As you went through shortly before
22 this picture, you entered a rest room area, and
23 would proceed to the right. It went through another
24 door which led into this room.
25 MR. SNEDDON: All right. Go ahead.
26 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People’s
27 Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
28 MR. SNEDDON: That’s it. Don’t go back. 546
 

 
1 Q. Okay. I just have one last final question.
2 With regard to the video footage that we’ve just --
3 that the ladies and gentlemen of the jury have just
4 seen, was that part of the footage from the -- when
5 you first got there, or was that from the footage
6 before you left that evening.
7 A. This was the prewarrant service footage.
8 Q. So it’s the condition of the house as it was
9 when you arrived there on the morning of the 13th of
10 November of 2003.
11 A. November the 18th.
12 Q. Thank you. I just wanted to see if you were
13 still awake.
14 No further questions.
15 THE COURT: Cross-examine.
16 MR. SANGER: Thank you, Your Honor.
17
18 CROSS-EXAMINATION
19 BY MR. SANGER:
20 Q. Is it Detective or Deputy.
21 A. At the time that this was, I was a
22 detective. I have since been reassigned and it’s
23 Deputy now.
24 Q. You prefer “Deputy”.
25 A. That’s fine.
26 Q. There you go. All right. Deputy Lafferty,
27 why don’t we just pick up where we left off - that’s
28 always a good place - and we’ll go to some of the 547
 

 
1 other areas.
2 First of all, the video that we just saw --
3 and I’m going to go back over some of the parts
4 again. But the video that we just saw, Exhibit 336,
5 was taken on the day of the search of the ranch,
6 correct.
7 A. That’s correct.
8 Q. And it was November the 18th, 2003; is that
9 correct.
10 A. That’s correct.
11 Q. Now, prior to that search, you were briefed
12 along with quite a number of other officers about
13 what was going to take place; is that correct.
14 A. That’s correct.
15 Q. And you received a briefing outline,
16 briefing memo of some sort; do you recall that.
17 A. Not all of us were given that. But teams
18 were assigned, and there was a packet given to each
19 team leader.
20 Q. Did you get a packet.
21 A. No, I did not.
22 Q. You were aware of the purpose of the search;
23 is that correct.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. And you were aware that this arose out of
26 allegations by the Arvizo family; is that correct.
27 A. I do not know who the victim was.
28 Q. Do you recall that the allegations were with 548
 

 
1 regard to activities that may or may not have
2 occurred in February and March of 2003; is that
3 correct.
4 A. I don’t recall.
5 Q. All right. In any event, what you have
6 shown here on the video is part of the tape that you
7 did that day, right.
8 A. That’s correct.
9 Q. And the tape you did that day documents what
10 the premises looked like on November 8 -- I’m sorry,
11 November 18th, 2003, correct.
12 A. That’s correct.
13 Q. And it does not document how the premises
14 looked in February or March of 2003.
15 A. That’s correct.
16 Q. All right. Now, how many officers came out
17 to the Neverland Valley location.
18 A. I’m not aware of the total number.
19 Q. Was it about 45 or so.
20 A. I don’t know.
21 Q. You indicated that you arrived at the ranch
22 at 9:07, and you started your video at 0955 hours;
23 is that correct.
24 A. That is correct.
25 Q. That’s about the same time that Chris
26 Pappas -- what’s -- what’s Mr. Pappas’s rank.
27 A. Sergeant.
28 Q. Sergeant. That’s about the time that 549
 

 
1 Sergeant Pappas issued a press release to the press;
2 is that correct.
3 A. I don’t know. I wasn’t aware what time he
4 did that.
5 Q. You were aware he did that, though, is that
6 right.
7 A. At some point during the day, yes.
8 Q. And the officers -- well, you don’t know how
9 many, but there were quite a number, were there not,
10 sir.
11 A. Yes, there were.
12 Q. You’ve been trained in the academy before
13 you became a sheriff’s deputy, correct.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. And part of your training in the academy is
16 to observe and document what you see at a scene; is
17 that correct.
18 A. Correct.
19 Q. All right. And you were not responsible for
20 counting the number of officers, I take it.
21 A. No, I was not.
22 Q. But as a trained deputy, you can tell me
23 generally how many people were out there, can’t you.
24 More than, say, 30.
25 A. Yes.
26 Q. All right. And this was Mr. Jackson’s home,
27 that was your understanding; is that correct.
28 A. That’s correct. 550
 

 
1 Q. And it’s a home that he appeared to live in;
2 is that right.
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. With his family.
5 A. It appeared so.
6 Q. And he had, at that time, and has three
7 children; is that correct.
8 A. I believe so. I don’t know the total
9 number.
10 Q. When you went through the house, you saw
11 that there were bedrooms for his three children; did
12 you not.
13 A. There were three bedrooms upstairs, yes.
14 Q. And they actually had name tags on the door,
15 didn’t they.
16 A. There were tags on the doors, yes.
17 Q. Okay. And each of those bedrooms for the
18 children had a key pad to keep people from coming in
19 without a combination if the door was locked; is
20 that correct.
21 A. I do recall seeing key pads on the doors.
22 Q. And Mr. Jackson’s suite, the part that you
23 showed on the video there, where you go through the
24 double doors, had a key pad to restrict access; is
25 that correct.
26 A. I believe so, yes.
27 Q. Okay. Now, we’ll go back over it so
28 everybody has a clearer picture, but just to do a 551
 

 
1 word picture first, when you come into the house --
2 you showed some pictures. You come into the house,
3 there’s a -- what you might call a living room area;
4 is that right.
5 A. There’s the foyer area where the stairs are.
6 There’s a hallway leading north from where the front
7 door area is.
8 Q. And if you go north, there’s an area that
9 has a castle.
10 A. That’s correct.
11 Q. But it also has chairs and a television set
12 and clocks and that sort of thing; is that correct.
13 A. I don’t recall any seating areas in the
14 areas with the castle.
15 Q. Okay. We’ll go back and look at the
16 pictures again. But you also showed an area that
17 had sort of a blue plaid -- or a sitting area with a
18 fireplace or -- a fireplace; is that right.
19 A. Right.
20 Q. And that’s sort of a family room area; is
21 that right.
22 A. Yes, that’s just off of the kitchen.
23 Q. That’s off that big kitchen area that you
24 showed with the copper hood and all that.
25 A. Correct.
26 Q. Next to that is a dining area; is that
27 correct --
28 A. Yes. 552
 

 
1 Q. -- with a dining table.
2 Something you didn’t show on the video, if
3 you were going to the right of what I’m calling the
4 living room area, is a library; is that right. Do
5 you remember that.
6 A. Yes. If you walk through the foyer area,
7 and go to the right, there was what appeared to be a
8 library or a study area.
9 Q. So when you go into -- let me withdraw that.
10 When you’re in that part of the house that we’ve
11 just described, that’s all pretty open. In other
12 words, you can walk freely from the back door
13 through the kitchen, to the family area, the living
14 room, the study, or library, the dining area, the
15 front foyer and the front door, right.
16 A. Right.
17 Q. Correct.
18 The actual living areas for Mr. Jackson and
19 his children are accessible by using the key pads;
20 is that right.
21 A. When I was in the residence, those doors
22 were all open. But there were key pads next to the
23 doors.
24 Q. Okay. So to get to the children’s room, you
25 would go upstairs, off the foyer to the right, you’d
26 go upstairs, and the children’s rooms are all up in
27 that area; is that correct.
28 A. Correct. 553
 

 
1 Q. That’s the same place where you saw what you
2 described as the doll room; is that correct.
3 A. Correct.
4 Q. And the area you called the toy room, we
5 might call it a craft room, but that’s in the same
6 area where the children’s suite is; is that correct.
7 A. That’s correct.
8 Q. Okay. And, in fact, above that -- you
9 didn’t show us a picture of this -- but above that
10 or in that area is a classroom. Remember the
11 classroom.
12 A. There was another -- appeared to be another
13 toy room. There were numerous toys, things in that
14 area, yes.
15 Q. And there were little desks and sort of a
16 little mini classroom, don’t you -- do you recall
17 that.
18 A. There were a number of things in there. I
19 don’t specifically remember desks.
20 Q. Remember there was a train set.
21 A. I do remember the train.
22 Q. In one end -- and if you go in the other
23 end, there’s a more open area. There may or may not
24 have been desks there; is that what you’re telling
25 us.
26 A. I don’t specifically recall a desk. But --
27 Q. All right. Going back -- just doing this
28 with a word picture so the film will make a little 554
 

 
1 more sense, hopefully. When you -- if we go back to
2 the front door, and instead of going up the stairs
3 to the children’s area we go to the right, there’s a
4 hallway. That I think you showed on there; is that
5 correct.
6 A. Correct.
7 Q. And that’s where the double doors are to
8 Mr. Jackson’s private area; is that correct.
9 A. That’s correct.
10 Q. And that’s where he has a key pad, correct.
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. And inside of that area he has what you
13 called a sitting room, but it’s like a living room
14 on the first floor; is that right.
15 A. Correct.
16 Q. There’s a grand piano.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. There are books.
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Lots of books.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Okay. There’s a big screen T.V..
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. Okay. And while you’re in that first floor
25 area, you showed us on the video something that you
26 referred to as the bathroom; remember that.
27 A. Yes.
28 Q. And that had that Jacuzzi tub in there. 555
 

 
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. Now, if you walk through the door, and you
3 do a right face, you would be facing that big screen
4 T.V.. If you walk through the door, get in the
5 middle of the room, do a right face, you’re facing
6 the big screen T.V., correct.
7 A. It would be 90 degrees to the T.V.
8 Q. Okay. Half right.
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. All right. Do a half right face. Point is,
11 on that wall with the big screen T.V., you then have
12 a door to the left.
13 A. Correct.
14 Q. And that goes into what you call the master
15 bathroom, is that correct, or you call it a
16 bathroom. Whatever you call it.
17 A. Uh-huh.
18 Q. That has a Jacuzzi.
19 A. Right.
20 Q. And that area with the Jacuzzi actually has
21 a number of books, there’s writing materials,
22 there’s VCRs, there’s all sorts of things in there;
23 is that correct.
24 A. That’s correct.
25 Q. There’s a place to sit that -- perhaps when
26 the house was designed it was a vanity, but there’s
27 a place to sit, which appears to also include stacks
28 of books and VCRs and things like that, correct. 556
 

 
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. The actual water closet, as they say in
3 England, but the toilet area is in a separate room
4 off to the right of that; is that correct.
5 A. That’s correct.
6 Q. And there’s a closet in there that has even
7 more books and other things in it; is that correct.
8 A. That’s correct.
9 Q. And, in fact, right there, there’s a back
10 door to go out the back of the house, is there not.
11 A. Yes, there is.
12 Q. Okay. And then if we back out of there and
13 we come back, having done that half right, we’re
14 facing the big screen T.V., on the right side
15 there’s another bathroom area; is that correct.
16 A. Yes, there is.
17 Q. Okay. And there’s a lot of stuff stored all
18 over the place there, is that right, when you were
19 there.
20 A. Yes, there was.
21 Q. A lot of movie memorabilia.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And you saw, you know, original things that
24 appeared to be signed by all sorts of celebrities.
25 A. Yes.
26 Q. Walt Disney, Shirley Temple, Steven
27 Spielberg, people like that.
28 A. Yes. 557
 

 
1 Q. And as you go in that bathroom area, there
2 is an actual water closet or bathroom sink area
3 that’s off of that; is that correct.
4 A. Correct.
5 Q. And then you go up those stairs, up to the
6 area where the bed is that you showed us; is that
7 correct.
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. Now, what kind of equipment were you using
10 to film this.
11 A. I was using a Sony DVCAM.
12 Q. Okay. And how do you operate that.
13 A. It’s a basic camera used by a lot of the
14 media that you see outside. It’s a larger format
15 camera.
16 Q. Okay. Do you put it on your shoulder.
17 A. It’s a shoulder-mount-held, yes.
18 Q. And you’re looking through at -- your eye
19 level is roughly the level of the lens; is that
20 correct.
21 A. That’s correct.
22 Q. Okay. And how tall are you, sir.
23 A. Five-ten.
24 Q. Okay. So when you walk up the stairs,
25 you’re walking up the stairs shooting at your eye
26 level for a five-ten person; is that correct.
27 A. That’s correct.
28 Q. All right. 558
 

 
1 All right. Let me venture into the unknown
2 and try to work this, if I may, Your Honor. What I
3 propose to do is -- with the approval of the Court,
4 and if there’s no objection from the People, I
5 propose to fast forward and just go to the
6 particular points that I want to highlight, if
7 that’s all right.
8 THE COURT: I think that would be good.
9 MR. SANGER: All right.
10 (Laughter.)
11 MR. SNEDDON: I better not have any
12 objection.
13 MR. SANGER: And Mr. Sneddon’s free to play
14 it all again, if he wants.
15 MR. SNEDDON: I’m not that stupid.
16 MR. SANGER: Did you turn it off. It’s
17 already -- okay. Okay. I’m actually going to pause
18 here quickly.
19 Q. There’s a little shot right at the
20 beginning, the first few seconds, when you put this
21 in the machine, it shows this area. And I don’t
22 think you commented on this.
23 There appear to be some big video games and
24 some arcade kind of games in the picture here. I
25 stopped it at 07.
26 A. Yes, that’s correct.
27 Q. Where is that located.
28 A. I have been informed that this was the 559
 

 
1 arcade room, which was a building behind the main
2 residence.
3 Q. Now, when you say you’ve been informed, does
4 that mean you took this.
5 A. I did not shoot this video, no.
6 Q. Were you in that building.
7 A. No, I was not.
8 Q. Do you know who shot this footage.
9 A. Yes, I do.
10 Q. Who do you believe shot this.
11 A. Detective Wittenbrock.
12 Q. Okay. Now, your official designation at the
13 time you were doing this was as a forensic deputy,
14 is that -- or what was the official title that you
15 had.
16 A. I was a detective assigned to the forensics
17 bureau.
18 Q. Forensics bureau. Now, there’s what’s
19 called crime scene investigators, or sometimes
20 referred to as CSI crime scene investigator. I’m
21 not talking about television. I’m talking about in
22 your department. Unlike television, in your
23 department, a CSI may not be an actual forensic
24 deputy; is that correct.
25 A. That is my job, crime scene investigation.
26 MR. SANGER: Oops. Need to get closer. I
27 didn’t know what the bailiff was doing to me right
28 then. 560
 

 
1 (Laughter.)
2 MR. SANGER: I’m glad it was a friendly
3 gesture.
4 THE COURT: She wasn’t going to hug you.
5 MR. SANGER: I knew she was armed. I was
6 afraid it might be something else.
7 Q. The -- okay. So at least at some point in
8 your department, they might have a sergeant go out
9 and be a CSI for a particular crime scene; is that
10 correct.
11 A. Correct.
12 Q. But you now have a forensics bureau, and the
13 forensic -- the officers, the deputies assigned to
14 the forensic bureau are supposed to be the crime
15 scene investigators, forensic experts or specialists
16 in your department; is that correct.
17 A. Correct.
18 Q. All right. And you were one of them.
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. How many forensic people did you have on
21 November 18th, 2003.
22 A. I believe there were seven of us.
23 Q. How many of them were detailed to this
24 particular case.
25 A. All of them.
26 Q. Okay. Were they all out there that day.
27 A. Yes.
28 Q. Now, we were talking about who was out 561
 

 
1 there. Besides however many police officers there
2 were, there were a number of D.A.’s investigators;
3 is that correct.
4 A. Correct.
5 Q. Those are people who work for the District
6 Attorney’s Office as opposed to the sheriff or the
7 police department; is that correct.
8 A. Correct.
9 Q. In addition to that, Mr. Sneddon actually
10 came out and walked through Mr. Jackson’s home; is
11 that correct.
12 A. Correct.
13 Q. And Mr. Franklin came out and did the same,
14 is that correct, Deputy D.A. Franklin.
15 A. I recall seeing him outside the residence.
16 I don’t know if he walked through.
17 Q. Now, let’s go through this quickly, if we
18 can.
19 So we have some footage here -- let’s see,
20 I’ve got to point this right at it, I guess. There
21 we go.
22 We have some footage that fades out, and now
23 the rest of this film is what you shot; correct.
24 A. That’s correct.
25 Q. Okay. So, we’ve been over it, but that’s
26 the front door leading into the foyer. And in the
27 distance you can see an area that has -- well, let’s
28 see, you have your pointer there. 562
 

 
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. Is there a big clock right in there; do you
3 recall.
4 A. The pillar directly in this area, yeah.
5 Q. That’s a big clock right there. All right.
6 Oops. I’ll point that there.
7 Now, we just saw off to the left -- this may
8 or may not work the way I’m -- there we go.
9 Okay. There’s a fella standing there.
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Is that a real person.
12 A. No, it’s not.
13 Q. A mannequin.
14 A. Yes, it is.
15 Q. There are a number of mannequins all over
16 Neverland.
17 A. Yes, there are.
18 Q. Some down by the -- by the big gates, when
19 you come through the big gates --
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. -- in a little house there.
22 They’re all over the house in various
23 places --
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. -- correct.
26 That one appears to be a butler and he’s
27 holding a dish with cookies in it; is that right.
28 A. That’s correct. 563
 

 
1 Q. Did you go into Mr. Jackson’s office.
2 A. No, I did not.
3 Q. Let’s see if I can fast forward here.
4 Okay. And then that’s a double door to the
5 right of the door that we talked about. You go down
6 a little hallway. There are books in the bookcases
7 there; is that right.
8 A. That’s correct.
9 Q. That’s not the actual library we talked
10 about, though, is it.
11 A. No, it’s not.
12 Q. If you go to the left through the double
13 doors that you can see in the picture there, can you
14 point that out to the --
15 A. There is a set of double doors right here,
16 which led into that library area also.
17 Q. Okay. And there’s a library of books all
18 over the place in there on bookshelves, correct.
19 A. Correct.
20 Q. And if you go down this little hallway,
21 that’s where the double doors are to Mr. Jackson’s
22 suite --
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. -- that you described.
25 Okay. And just to the left of that -- so we
26 don’t take too much time, I’ll fast forward. But
27 just to the left of this is the stairway. Outside
28 the picture, there’s a stairway that goes up to the 564
 

 
1 children’s suite.
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Now, this is the area here at .38, .39. See
4 the sitting area there.
5 A. Yes, I do.
6 Q. Okay. This is what I was referring to as
7 the living room. Does that make sense.
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. All right. And then this is the family
10 room. I said plaid -- there’s plaid on the wall,
11 blue couches there.
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Family room.
14 And that’s -- if you turn right around and
15 did an about face from where you were just showing
16 the family room, you do an about face, you’re
17 looking at the kitchen.
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. And it’s open, this counter is right in
20 between the two, right.
21 A. Yes, there is.
22 Q. And when you were there, when the -- when
23 the sheriffs arrived, there were a number of
24 employees in this area; is that correct.
25 A. I was told that there were, yes.
26 Q. Okay. And so this is an open area where
27 employees are, guests might come in, that sort of
28 thing; is that your understanding. 565
 

 
1 A. I believe so, yes.
2 Q. All right. I’ll fast forward again.
3 Okay. Back to the -- that’s down the
4 hallway. And that’s going into Mr. Jackson’s area.
5 We’re at 153. That’s going into his first-floor
6 area.
7 And then to the right, this is -- this is
8 that right-hand area that we talked about. It
9 actually -- you got into the closet here, I guess.
10 We’re looking at the screen at 203.
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. But there’s the right-hand bathroom. And
13 you said if you face that big screen T.V. on the
14 right side, the half right there, the big screen
15 T.V., on the right side is the bathroom area and
16 closets, correct.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. There’s the stairway. And you’re coming up
19 the stairway there with the camera up to your eye,
20 and you get up to the top there, and you look in; is
21 that correct.
22 A. That’s correct.
23 MR. SNEDDON: I’m going to object to that
24 question. It’s not at the top. The video speaks
25 for itself in relationship to where it is.
26 THE COURT: Overruled. Go ahead.
27 MR. SANGER: Thank you.
28 Q. We’re going to fast forward here. 566
 

 
1 Now, we’re back down -- this is the area
2 that you did the half right to the video screen, a
3 big screen T.V. And you go to the left and you go
4 into this area, correct.
5 A. That’s correct.
6 Q. And this you described as a bathroom. It
7 does have that Jacuzzi tub at the end, correct.
8 A. Correct.
9 Q. Okay. And I’ll try to fast forward. Can
10 you show us where the door to the back is.
11 A. It was behind the curtains in this area.
12 Q. If you go by that safe and you go to the
13 right, and that’s the actual door; is that correct.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. And those curtains are -- the curtains fit
16 outside to the garden, I would suspect; is that
17 right.
18 A. I believe so, yes.
19 Q. There are curtains over windows to the
20 outside. All right. And then if you go to the
21 right, there’s a safe there.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. With a picture of a little girl on the
24 thing. And if you go to the right there, that’s an
25 area -- sort of a closet area, has a lot of books
26 and other things in it; is that correct.
27 A. Right here, this area, is that what you’re
28 referring to. 567
 

 
1 Q. Yes.
2 A. That is the area that has the toilet in it.
3 Q. Are there two doors, or just one there.
4 A. There’s two doors on that side of the room.
5 Q. And you believe that’s the one that goes to
6 the toilet area.
7 A. I believe so, yes.
8 Q. Okay. Could that be the one that goes to
9 the toilet area, the one on the right.
10 A. The one on the left is the one that goes
11 into the toilet area.
12 Q. You’re right. There’s a toilet; how about
13 that.
14 So the other one is the one that goes into
15 the closet that has books and other memorabilia and
16 stuff.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Okay. And here we have the sort of living
19 room. There’s a couch. There’s a fireplace. To
20 the left, you can’t see it, but there’s a big screen
21 T.V., which we’re about to see. There it is, with
22 the movie cut out in front of it. And then you go
23 back out the door.
24 All right. I’m going to stop it. And we
25 can turn it off, I think.
26 THE BAILIFF: Can you just hit “black
27 screen”.
28 Q. BY MR. SANGER: Now, how long was the actual 568
 

 
1 video that you did in this -- on this location. I
2 mean, you did one video before the search. How long
3 was that video.
4 A. It was approximately an hour.
5 Q. Okay. And then you did more documentation
6 afterwards. About how long was that.
7 A. I did a total of three tapes. The
8 post-search video was approximately an hour also.
9 Q. All right. So out of the first hour, you
10 selected so many minutes that we just saw there; is
11 that right.
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. All right. Now, you did take some still
14 photos, you said, of various items. Did you take
15 any still photos in one of the bathroom areas, which
16 you’ve described as the bathroom.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Did you take photos of a briefcase.
19 A. Yes, I did.
20 Q. All right. Now, at some point, as the
21 forensic investigator in this case, did you take
22 charge of the materials that were inside of that
23 briefcase.
24 A. The initial collection was done by the
25 detectives who were conducting the search. It was
26 later turned over to us, which was secured in our
27 lab.
28 Q. All right. What -- do you know the 569
 

 
1 sheriff’s number for the materials that were inside
2 that briefcase.
3 A. No, I do not.
4 Q. Does 317 ring a bell.
5 A. I don’t know.
6 Q. Okay. Did you bring your reports with you.
7 A. Yes, I did.
8 Q. Can you tell by looking at your various
9 reports what the number of those items was.
10 A. I do not show -- I’m sorry.
11 I do have one report that refers to No. 317.
12 Q. Okay. So the contents of the briefcase were
13 Sheriff’s Item 317; is that correct.
14 A. I was not involved with the assignment of
15 the number. I don’t know what number it was
16 assigned at the time.
17 Q. Let’s talk about numbers just for a second.
18 We have exhibit numbers in court here that are
19 assigned by the clerk. There may be reference to
20 exhibit numbers from another proceeding; for
21 instance, the grand jury.
22 But when the sheriff -- when your department
23 seizes evidence, you mark down a number on an
24 inventory sheet, and then you put that number on a
25 tag, and you put that on the actual item that’s
26 seized; is that correct.
27 A. That’s correct.
28 Q. So you can keep track -- no matter what 570
 

 
1 numbers the Court gives, or, say, the grand jury
2 gives something, there’s also the sheriff’s number.
3 And we can go back to that, and you can say that’s
4 the item, because it was given that number; is that
5 correct.
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. All right. Now, do you remember checking
8 the contents of the briefcase out of the sheriff’s
9 lockup; in other words, sheriff’s evidence lockup to
10 take to the lab.
11 MR. SNEDDON: Your Honor, I’m going to
12 object, because there were several briefcases taken.
13 And I’m -- it’s unclear as to which one he’s talking
14 about. He has no personal knowledge as to what the
15 itemization of the number was, so lack of foundation
16 would be the short way of putting it.
17 THE COURT: Foundation; sustained.
18 MR. SANGER: Okay.
19 Q. All right. And you can’t tell -- you can’t
20 tell us from your reports what items you took out of
21 the sheriff’s lockup to do testing on.
22 A. Yes, I can.
23 Q. Do you want to tell us what numbers those
24 were.
25 A. The original ones which I was assigned to
26 begin with was 304, 306, 307, 309, and 313.
27 Q. Did you eventually take 317.
28 A. The only involvement that I had with that 571
 

 
1 initially was I picked up Item 317 from the
2 Department of Justice Lab and took it back for photo
3 documentation at our lab.
4 Q. All right. And what date was that.
5 A. That was on 5-20-04.
6 Q. Do you recall on January 30th assisting
7 Deputy Herman. Is that Lisa Herman.
8 A. Hemman.
9 Q. Sorry. Hemman. Do you recall assisting
10 Deputy Hemman in going through various evidence
11 items.
12 A. Yes, I do.
13 Q. And among those evidence items was 317, one
14 of those items.
15 A. It may have been. I don’t recall the
16 specific number.
17 Q. And when you were working with Deputy
18 Hemman -- when you were assisting Deputy Hemman,
19 what were you doing. Were you doing fingerprints.
20 A. That was an alternate light source search.
21 Q. So you weren’t looking for fingerprints.
22 A. No.
23 Q. You were looking at the items to see if
24 there was some other substance, fluid, blood, semen,
25 something on them; is that right.
26 A. Correct.
27 Q. And you didn’t find anything on 317.
28 A. I don’t know. 572
 

 
1 Q. All right. Okay.
2 Can I have -- and I suppose the clerk has
3 them now -- the exhibits that this witness referred
4 to. And I think it was 4 or 5 through about 12.
5 The photographs. Okay. Thank you.
6 Now, venturing into yet another area, with
7 the Court’s permission, I’m going to try to use the
8 overhead projector. And let’s see here. I think we
9 hit that button.
10 THE BAILIFF: And you hit the “black screen”
11 button. And is it on.
12 MR. SANGER: Yes, it is. How about that.
13 Q. I want to direct your attention -- okay. If
14 you put the lights on it there’s a little more
15 light, but then there’s glare.
16 If you look at Exhibit 8, which has been
17 received in evidence - and I put it up on the
18 overhead camera - that’s one of the pictures you
19 told us that you had taken, and then you put the
20 labeling on to show what the various parts of the
21 ranch were, correct.
22 A. That’s correct.
23 Q. And with your laser there, if you could,
24 show us where the lake is. I think we can see it.
25 But just to orient, because it’s a little dark.
26 A. The dark area, beginning in the center of
27 the photograph, extending up and to the left,
28 around. That area there. 573
 

 
1 Q. Okay. And right there where it says
2 “Guesthouse,” those are the guest units on the
3 property; is that correct.
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. And they’re right on the lake; is that
6 right.
7 A. That’s correct.
8 Q. Did you determine what the numbers of the
9 guest units were. 1, 2, 3, 4.
10 A. No, I do not.
11 Q. There are four, though, four units in that
12 area, correct.
13 A. I’m not aware of how many there are.
14 Q. In any event, there’s a guesthouse that
15 appears to have more than one unit. Would you grant
16 me that.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. There you go.
19 And then the main house is depicted. You
20 can see the main house from the guesthouse, correct.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. And, in fact, you just walk -- how far is
23 the main house from the guesthouse.
24 A. 75 yards.
25 Q. Oh. Now, see the train station there.
26 A. Yes.
27 Q. And the train station is actually up on a
28 hill; is that right. 574
 

 
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. And there’s a road that leads -- in the
3 picture that’s going up, but actually goes downhill
4 towards the main house and the guesthouse; is that
5 correct.
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Can you show the jury where that is, please.
8 A. This is the building of the train station
9 here. And this is the road that leads up past the
10 main house.
11 Q. So the main house is on the left and the
12 guesthouse is on the right.
13 A. Correct.
14 Q. And there’s a clock that -- a large
15 decorative clock that is located right in front of
16 that train station; is that correct.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And I’m going to put up No. 12, which has
19 been received into evidence.
20 No. 12 is an aerial shot of that clock; is
21 that correct.
22 A. Yes, it is.
23 Q. And of course, from the air, everything
24 looks flat on the ground. You don’t really see the
25 contours of the hills and so on; is that right.
26 A. Correct.
27 Q. And, in fact, the clock itself is created on
28 about a 45-degree angle; was it not. 575
 

 
1 A. I was not in that area, so I couldn’t say.
2 Q. So you took the picture from up above.
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. And how high were you. What was your
5 elevation when you took that picture.
6 A. We were about 1200 to 1500 feet.
7 Q. Okay. So this clock would be visible from
8 thousands of feet in the area; is that right.
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. And it tells time. It’s a working clock,
11 correct.
12 A. I do not know that.
13 Q. When you -- when you were on the ground
14 there, you didn’t look over and see that clock.
15 A. I did see the clock.
16 Q. So when you’re on the ground, by the house
17 and the guest units, you could look over and see
18 that clock, correct.
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. All right. And when I said “45-degree
21 angle,” I’m not trying to quibble. I don’t know. I
22 didn’t measure. Okay. But it’s not on the ground
23 flat, facing into space.
24 A. Correct. It is at an angle.
25 Q. It’s at an angle so you can see it from the
26 property.
27 A. Yes.
28 Q. Did you notice that there were a number of 576
 

 
1 other clocks that were positioned in various place
2 on this property.
3 A. The only area that I was on the property was
4 at the main residence.
5 MR. SANGER: Okay. Let me just have one
6 moment, Your Honor, please.
7 I have no further questions. Thank you.
8 MR. SNEDDON: No questions, Your Honor.
9 Your Honor, I --
10 THE COURT: You may step down, Officer.
11 Thank you.
12 MR. SNEDDON: I have the next witness ready.
13 It’s five minutes to break time. Do you want to
14 take the break five minutes early before we start
15 that witness.
16 THE COURT: No, we can start the witness.
17 MR. SNEDDON: It will take two minutes to
18 get her here.
19 MR. SANGER: Let me use ten seconds of the
20 two minutes, Your Honor.
21 THE COURT: Well, the witness is on its way.
22 You can go ahead.
23 MR. SANGER: I was just going to say before
24 Deputy Lafferty leaves, that we would like him to
25 remain on re-call. And I think we will have to call
26 him back when we have other officers to testify to
27 the chain of custody on the items we’re talking
28 about. 577
 

 
1 THE COURT: All right. Officer, you’ll
2 remain on call, please.
3 MR. SANGER: Thank you, Your Honor.
4 MR. SNEDDON: Judge, I’m sorry. My
5 understanding was that the witness was right behind
6 your door, right off your room in the anteroom
7 there, and it would take less than 20 seconds to get
8 here. It’s one of the children in this case. I
9 apologize, but that was my understanding. It’s
10 not -- she’s not up in my office.
11 Jill. Right off your room in the anteroom
12 there, and it would take
13 THE COURT: Come forward to the witness
14 stand, please. Remain standing. Face the clerk,
15 over here, raise your right hand.
16
17 DAVELLIN ARVIZO
18 Having been sworn, testified as follows:
19
20 THE WITNESS: Yes.
21 THE CLERK: Please be seated. State and
22 spell your name for the record.
23 THE WITNESS: My name is Davellin Arvizo.
24 D-a-v-e-l-l-i-n, A-r-v-i-z-o.

26 real close.

19 MR. SNEDDON: I move that it be admitted

22 didn’t hear.
23 THE COURT: It’s okay. He moved that exhibit
24 into evidence. She identified it.
25 MR. MESEREAU: There’s still a foundational

27 an accurate depiction of the interior of that plane.
28 I don’t think the foundation has been laid. 669
 

 
1 THE COURT: I’ll admit it. I think that’s a
2 subject of cross-examination.
3 MR. MESEREAU: Okay.
4 MR. SNEDDON: All right. We’re going to
5 display something up on the Elmo, Your Honor. And
6 what we’re going to display is 339.
7 Q. Now, you have the exhibit in front of you,
8 okay.
9 What I want you to do is, I want you to take
10 a felt tip pen, if you would, and I want you to put
11 your initials in the seat in which you were located.
12 Well, first of all, let me do this. Take
13 that light, the black thing with the light, okay,
14 and show the ladies and gentlemen of the jury where

27 your initials in your seat.
28 Okay. What did you put. 670
 

 
1 A. “DA.”
2 Q. That figures.
3 Now, would you please put the initials for
4 your brother in the seat that he was in on
5 Exhibit 339.
6 And then put just like an “MJ” for where
7 Mr. Jackson was sitting.
8 And a “PJ” for where Paris was sitting.
9 Now, would you show the ladies and gentlemen
10 of the jury with the light again, if you would,

12 A. She was sitting in one of these four seats.
13 Q. So you’re not sure which one of those four.
14 A. I don’t remember.

26 Q. Would you show the ladies and gentlemen of
27 the jury.
28 A. He was either sitting right here or he would 671
 

 
1 go to this seat.
2 Q. So he moved back and forth between those
3 seats.
4 All right. The two seats that you said he
5 moved back and forth between, would you put his
6 initials in those seats on the Exhibit 339. Would
7 you put them in both of them.
8 Now, I want to direct your attention to
9 where you believed that you saw the telephone.
10 Okay.
11 A. Okay.
12 Q. Would you point that out to the jury.
13 A. Right here.
14 Q. Okay. And would you put -- you can put --
15 on the white area, put “TFC,” and then the arrow to
16 where it was located on the exhibit. Would you do

19 series of chairs, do you see that.
20 A. Yes.

28 area, too. 672
 

 
1 Q. Do you remember which seats they were in.
2 A. No, they would switch around.
3 Q. Why don’t you just go ahead and put their
4 initials, just Aldo and Marie Nicole, in those two
5 seats, just -- and an arrow back and forth. How’s
6 that. Okay.
7 Now, you told us -- who else was on the
8 plane.
9 A. Mr. Jackson’s doctor and the two nannies.
10 Q. Do you know the doctor’s name.
11 A. No.
12 Q. Do you know where he was seated.
13 A. He was in one of the four chairs.
14 Q. Show us.
15 A. In one of these chairs.
16 Q. Okay. Who else was up in that four-chair
17 area besides your mother and this doctor.
18 A. The two nannies.
19 Q. Okay. So why don’t you just put “Doctor,”
20 just put a “DR,” just -- and “2-nannies.”
21 Okay. Now, if we could just move the
22 exhibit a little bit farther to the right, so it
23 shows all the way to the front, or all the way to
24 the end.
25 Okay. Now, from this particular exhibit,
26 339, the one that’s in front of you, looking at the
27 far left-hand part of the exhibit that’s on the
28 board above you, do you see that. What end of the 673
 

 
1 plane is that.
2 A. This is the back of the plane.
3 Q. Okay. Could you just write in the white
4 space above it “back” and put an arrow down to that.
5 Can you tell us, what are the areas depicted
6 in this particular part of Exhibit 339.
7 A. This is the bathroom. There was an area
8 back -- I don’t know. It was an area back here
9 where the flight attendant would make the food and
10 stuff.
11 Q. Okay.
12 A. And then the luggage is way in the back.
13 Q. Okay. So show us the bathroom again.
14 A. Right here.
15 Q. Okay. So that little white box that’s on
16 the screen there, do you see the little white box.
17 Is that part of the bathroom, on the lower part.
18 A. Yeah.
19 Q. Why don’t you write “BR” in there.
20 Okay. We’re going to slide the Exhibit 339
21 all the way to the other end. Okay.
22 So I take it that would be the front part of
23 the plane.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. So could we just write “front” on there, if
26 you would.
27 Do you remember where the door to the plane
28 is where you got on. 674
 

 
1 A. It’s right there.
2 Q. Okay. Do you want to write “door” in that
3 space.
4 All right. I think we’re done with that
5 exhibit. Thank you.
6 May I have a moment, Your Honor. We can
7 turn the lights back on.
8 All right. Now, that exhibit that you put
9 in front of you, that’s 339, the plane.
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Would you please just write your name on it.
12 Because we’re going to have several of those, and we
13 want to make sure that we have your name on it.
14 Thank you. Now, one other thing that I
15 think that I probably forgot to ask you that needs
16 to be asked: You told the ladies and gentlemen of
17 the jury that your brother had been diagnosed with
18 cancer.
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And that he had had a battle with cancer,
21 and had been going to the hospital and out of the
22 hospital from time to time.
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. How long was it before -- how long did it
25 last. How long did that illness last.
26 A. A year.
27 Q. And what happened at the end of the year.
28 A. He was in remission. There was no more -- 675
 

 
1 they couldn’t find no more cancer cells.
2 Q. So it was a year from when it first happened
3 to when it went into remission.
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Can you peg that for us in terms of where
6 you were in your schooling when he actually went
7 into remission.
8 A. My sophomore year.
9 Q. Was your father still in the house at the
10 time that he -- that Gavin -- Gavin went into
11 remission.
12 A. No.
13 Q. He was already gone.
14 A. Yes. He had left the month before.
15 Q. I’m sorry.
16 A. He had left the month before.
17 Q. Okay. Let’s move back to where we were
18 chronologically. And we’re talking about on the
19 plane coming from Miami.
20 Now, when the plane landed, did you know
21 where you were.
22 A. We were back in -- near the Neverland Ranch.
23 Q. And when you got off the plane, where did
24 you go.
25 A. We got picked up in a limo and we got took
26 to the ranch.
27 Q. Now, could you tell us, when you got off the
28 plane and you got into the limo, was it night or 676
 

 
1 day.
2 A. It was night.
3 Q. Do you remember about what time it was.
4 A. No. It was just pitch black.
5 Q. So you got into the limo. And were there
6 any stops between the airport and the ranch, to your
7 knowledge.
8 A. No. No.
9 Q. And when you got to the ranch, where did you
10 go.
11 A. I went to the guest room.
12 Q. Was it the same one you were in before or a
13 different one.
14 A. It was the same one.
15 Q. And do you know -- did you go in your mom’s
16 room, wherever your mom was staying.
17 A. Not that night. Just to say goodnight, but
18 not to stay there.
19 Q. So you went in there to say goodnight.
20 A. Yeah.
21 Q. Where was she staying.
22 A. She was staying next to me.
23 Q. Okay. In the guest quarters.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Now, with regard to your brothers, did you
26 see where they went when you got back to the ranch
27 and got out of the limo.
28 A. I just seen -- I saw them run off with Mr. 677

5 A. Towards the main house.
6 Q. Did you -- how far did you see them go
7 before you went and did something else.
8 A. I just saw them go into the main house.
9 Q. So you actually saw them go into the house.
10 A. Yeah.
11 Q. Did you see them at all the rest of that
12 night.
13 A. No.
14 Q. Now, while you were at the ranch now, had
15 you missed school.
16 A. No, because I was off track at that time.
17 Q. What does that mean.
18 A. I go to -- at that time I was on a
19 year-round school. So I would go to school for
20 three months; get three months off; and go to school
21 for three months.
22 Q. Now, you told us that when you were -- when
23 you heard about the trip to Miami, you called your
24 mom on a pay phone.
25 A. Yeah, it was like a couple days before the
26 vacation.
27 Q. But were you in school at that time.
28 A. I was in summer -- in like -- they have two 678
 

 
1 intersessions. One like summer school, but they had
2 it during the winter.
3 Q. Okay.
4 A. And I think I was -- I had some classes.
5 That’s why I was at school.
6 Q. Okay. And were your brothers, to your
7 knowledge, in school.
8 A. I think they were.
9 Q. Do you remember which school they were going
10 to at this time. By “this time,” I mean when you’re
11 at Neverland Valley Ranch after you’ve come back
12 from Miami.
13 A. I think they were in Hollenbeck. But I
14 couldn’t remember. I don’t remember really.
15 Q. Okay. At any time after you arrived back at
16 the ranch that night, did the person you described
17 previously as Dieter, the one you met in Miami at
18 the hotel --
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. -- did you ever see him on the ranch.
21 A. Later on.
22 Q. Okay. How many days later was it.
23 A. I think it was the next day or the following
24 day.
25 Q. Did you ever see the person that you named
26 as Ronald and identified in the photograph, did you
27 see that person come to the ranch.
28 A. Yes. 679
 

 
1 Q. Do you remember when that was.
2 A. Around the same time as Dieter.
3 Q. And during the time that you got to the
4 ranch, and when these two individuals arrived at the
5 ranch, did you know whether or not they were staying
6 at the ranch.
7 A. Yeah. I think so. Because they were there
8 all day from -- I’d see them.
9 Q. When you saw them, can you tell us whether
10 or not you ever saw them with Mr. Jackson.
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. On how many occasions during those first
13 days.
14 A. Well, anytime I’d really come into the main
15 house --
16 Q. You have to speak up.
17 A. Anytime I really, like, passed by the main
18 house, I would see them occasionally talking with
19 each other. But I really don’t remember.
20 Q. Okay.
21 A. It was a couple of times.
22 Q. Did you ever see them meeting and talking in
23 any other places on the location there.
24 A. No, not that I remember.
25 Q. Okay.
26 A. Like later on they would meet in the guest
27 quarters, but -- like Mr. Jackson and Ronald. But
28 not at the beginning. 680
 

 
1 Q. I couldn’t hear that.
2 A. Like later on --
3 Q. Okay.
4 A. -- like Mr. Jackson and Ronald would meet in
5 the guest quarters. But other than that, no.
6 Q. Okay. That was later on, though.
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Now, did you personally have any contact
9 with the people -- let’s say Dieter first. Let’s
10 start with the person you described as Dieter. Did
11 you ever have any conversations with him.
12 A. Couple times.
13 Q. What were the subjects of the conversations.
14 A. On the rebuttal film and us going to Brazil.
15 Q. All right. Let’s talk about the rebuttal
16 film, all right. What did Dieter tell you about the
17 rebuttal film. And first of all, let’s go back.
18 Where did -- excuse me.
19 Where did that conversation take place.
20 A. There was one conversation in one of the
21 guest quarters with me and my mom and my brothers.
22 Q. All right. Anybody else present.
23 A. No, it was just Dieter and us.
24 Q. And how many days do you think it was that
25 you’d been there before that conversation occurred.
26 A. Less than a week. Three days, four days.
27 Q. And what was the subject matter of the
28 conversation. 681
 

 
1 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; hearsay.

10 Q. Who wanted it back.
11 A. Dieter wanted it back from Gavin.
12 Q. And what was said.
13 A. That he wanted it back; that he could put it
14 in a safe and take care of it for him and he might
15 lose it, and he just wanted it back.
16 Q. All right. And did he get it back.
17 A. No.
18 Q. Why.
19 A. Gavin didn’t want to give it to him.
20 Q. What was your mother’s attitude towards
21 that.
22 A. Just -- she didn’t see no point in it. She
23 just -- whatever Gavin wanted.
24 Q. Now -- I got it. It’s all right.
25 Now, you told us that the other
26 conversations that you had with this gentleman
27 Dieter involved the rebuttal film.
28 A. Yes. 682
 

 
1 Q. Okay. Now, when you talk about a rebuttal
2 film, what do you mean by that.
3 A. They said they wanted to do another video,
4 and they wanted it to just be of us.
5 Q. Who’s “they”.
6 A. Dieter and Frank talked about it.
7 Q. Now, when -- let’s talk about Dieter first
8 of all, okay. When did you have a conversation with
9 Dieter about this rebuttal film.
10 A. I think it was in -- near, like, the kitchen
11 area. In that area. Like in the sitting area.
12 Q. Okay. And do you recall how long you’d been
13 at the ranch before -- when that conversation took
14 place.
15 A. It was after the watch incident, so five
16 days or so. I think.
17 Q. What did he say about -- what did he say to
18 you about the rebuttal.
19 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; hearsay.
20 MR. SNEDDON: Offered for the same purpose,
21 Your Honor.
22 THE COURT: All right. I’ll accept it
23 conditionally.
24 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Go ahead.
25 A. It was just -- we were supposed to say nice
26 things about him and just -- and he offered us -- to
27 give us a paper.
28 Q. A paper. What do you mean by “a paper”. 683
 

 
1 A. It was kind of like a script, just of things
2 to say.
3 Q. Did you read it.
4 A. Yeah.
5 Q. Do you remember what was on it.
6 A. Just nice things of Mr. Jackson, and that’s
7 it.
8 Q. Now, at some point in time after you arrived
9 at the ranch from Miami, and you’re on the ranch,
10 okay --
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. -- did you leave.
13 A. From --
14 Q. From Neverland. I’m not asking you how
15 long. I’m just asking did you leave.
16 A. We left at -- just to do the rebuttal.
17 Q. Okay.
18 A. And there was -- that’s all I remember,
19 yeah.
20 Q. Do you remember meeting a man at the ranch
21 by the name of Jesus.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Okay. Who is Jesus.
24 A. He’s one of the security guards there or
25 just one of the head people around the ranch.
26 Q. And did you ever leave the ranch with Jesus.
27 A. Yeah. Now I remember, yeah.
28 Q. Do you recall with regard to that particular 684
 

 
1 incident -- between the time that you arrived at the
2 ranch at Neverland and the time that you left with
3 Jesus, okay. We’re talking about that time.
4 A. (Nods head up and down.)
5 Q. Where did your mother stay on the ranch.
6 A. She stood in the guest quarters.
7 Q. And could you tell us, under your personal
8 observations and opinion, did your mother come out
9 of the room very often.
10 A. Never.
11 Q. Why.
12 A. She just never came out, and then --
13 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Calls for
14 speculation; hearsay. And no foundation.
15 MR. SNEDDON: Let me see if I can go back
16 and cure it a little bit, Judge. I think I can do
17 that without any problem.
18 THE COURT: All right.
19 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Okay. During the time that
20 you got from Miami and you got to the ranch --
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. -- to the time that you left with Jesus,
23 okay --
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. -- where were your brothers.
26 A. They were running around with Mr. Jackson.
27 Q. Did you see much of them.
28 A. Not really. 685
 

 
1 Q. So the only person that you know on the
2 ranch was your mother.
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. And did you spend time with your mother.
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And where did you spend time with your
7 mother.
8 A. In her room.
9 Q. And your room was next door to your mother’s
10 room.
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. So, do you have an opinion with regard to
13 how much your mother came out of her room.
14 A. Hardly never. Not really at all.
15 Q. During the time that you were there from --
16 you got back from Miami and before you left with
17 Jesus - okay. - how long was that; do you recall.
18 A. I’m sorry, repeat the question. I was
19 thinking about me and my mom in the room.
20 Q. Did I forget to ask you something about you
21 and your mom.
22 A. No, just thinking about the whole situation.
23 Can you repeat the question.
24 Q. Sure. From the time you arrived at the
25 ranch till the time you left with Jesus, okay, how
26 many days do you think that was.
27 A. I don’t remember. Close to a week or less.
28 I don’t remember. 686
 

 
1 Q. Okay.
2 A. It had been a while, though.
3 Q. Now, had -- can you describe your mother’s
4 demeanor and attitude during the time that she was
5 at the ranch between the time you got there and the
6 time you left with Jesus.
7 A. She seemed kind of worried and just didn’t
8 really understand the whole situation, what was
9 really going on. And she was kind of scared.
10 Q. Now, when -- when you left with Jesus, do
11 you remember what time of the night or day it was
12 that you left.
13 A. It was night.
14 Q. How do you know that.
15 A. Because it was really dark out.
16 Q. And do you remember the circumstances under
17 which you left.
18 A. Yeah, we were scared and we just --
19 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Hearsay;
20 foundation; calls for speculation.
21 THE COURT: Overruled.
22 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Go ahead.
23 A. We were kind of scared and we just really
24 didn’t -- the way the conversations with Dieter
25 went, they were real aggressive and just -- we were
26 scared, so -- of course Gavin didn’t want to leave.
27 But my mom and me, mainly my mom wanted to get us
28 out of there. 687
 

 
1 Q. All right. And then do you recall how Mr.
2 Salas -- I’m sorry, how Jesus got involved in this.
3 A. My mom asked him to take us to home.
4 Q. Were you present when she did that.
5 A. Not that I remember.
6 Q. So at some point you were told what, by your
7 mom.
8 A. By my mom, that we were leaving.
9 Q. And you gathered up your stuff, I take it.
10 A. Some little things. Not really. We just
11 really wanted to get out of there.
12 Q. And then what did you do.
13 A. We left.
14 Q. And who went.
15 A. Jesus, me, my brothers and my mom.
16 Q. Now, I don’t want you to speak for anybody
17 else, okay. I want you to speak for yourself. Why
18 was it that you felt that you were scared.
19 A. Just the whole situation. The whole
20 secrecy. The -- just real aggressive. I was just
21 scared. I didn’t understand what was going on and
22 why it was like this. I was just scared.
23 Q. Did you -- during this time, when you first
24 got to the ranch and before you left with Jesus, did
25 you have any interaction with the defendant in this
26 case, Mr. Jackson.
27 A. Just little interaction, yeah.
28 Q. All right. And can you describe that. 688
 

 
1 A. Hi; a hug; there would be times where I’d
2 walk in where Mr. Jackson and the boys and Aldo
3 would be and just say hi and stuff like that. But I
4 would leave immediately.
5 Q. Why.
6 A. Because they would tell me, “Oh, don’t you
7 want to go do that.” And just felt uncomfortable,
8 like if they didn’t want me there.
9 Q. So, just to fill in the rest of it for the
10 jury, the people that you’ve identified in those
11 photographs as Aldo and Marie Nicole, did they go to
12 the ranch at the same time that you folks did. From
13 the limo, from the plane, to the ranch.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. And they were there.
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. And do you know where Marie Nicole was
18 staying.
19 A. She stood in the main house.
20 Q. And how do you know that.
21 A. Because we would talk and stuff. And then I
22 stood in the room with her at one time, just sitting
23 and talking.
24 Q. To your knowledge, at any time did the boys
25 come back and stay in the guest cottage.
26 A. One time Star did.
27 Q. Between the time that you arrived from Miami
28 till the time you left with Jesus, did the boys come 689
 

 
1 back and stay in the guest cottage.
2 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; foundation.
3 THE COURT: Sustained.
4 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: To your knowledge, based
5 upon what you saw and observed, did you ever see the
6 boys stay the night in the guest cottage before you
7 left with Jesus.
8 MR. MESEREAU: Same objection; foundation.
9 THE COURT: Overruled.
10 You may answer.
11 THE WITNESS: Um, I think that was after,
12 after we came back.
13 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: What was after.
14 A. The incident with Star coming to sleep in
15 the room. It was after we had come back.
16 Q. Come back from.
17 A. I don’t know where it was placed. All I
18 know, there was one incident Star came and slept
19 with me in the room.
20 Q. Okay. So there was one time.
21 A. Yeah.
22 Q. All right. Can you tell us whether or not,
23 from your own personal observation -- strike that.
24 Did you see your mother interact with Dieter
25 and Ronald.
26 A. There was one incidence I saw him coming out
27 of my mom’s room, but -- I don’t remember. She
28 would tell me -- 690
 

 
1 Q. Don’t tell us what she said.
2 A. Okay.
3 Q. It’s not your fault.
4 A. From what I saw, no.
5 Q. You weren’t present during those
6 conversations.
7 A. No.
8 Q. But there were occasions when you saw Dieter
9 and Ronald coming out of your mom’s room.
10 A. Yeah.
11 Q. Did you go into -- don’t tell us what she
12 said. But after that, did you go in to see her
13 right away.
14 A. Yeah.
15 Q. Could you tell us whether or not she was
16 upset.
17 A. Yes. She seemed upset.
18 MR. MESEREAU: Objection.
19 I’ll withdraw the objection.
20 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Now, when you left with
21 Jesus, do you remember where you were taken.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Where were you taken.
24 A. To my grandmother’s house.
25 Q. And was your grandmother still living in El
26 Monte.
27 A. Yes.
28 Q. Now, after -- I’m sorry. Now, after you got 691
 

 
1 to -- got to El Monte, do you remember what time it
2 was.
3 A. It was night.
4 Q. Still night.
5 A. Uh-huh.
6 Q. So that night, did you spend the night there
7 with your grandparents.
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. At this point, was -- to your knowledge, was
10 your mother still seeing Major Jackson.
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. And, in fact -- let me put it this way: At
13 the point before you left for Miami, okay, for the
14 trip to Miami, was she still seeing Major Jackson.
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. At that point in time, was your mother
17 staying at the Soto Street address or with Major
18 Jackson.
19 A. Um --
20 Q. If you know.
21 A. At the very beginning we were still staying
22 at the Soto apartment.
23 Q. Okay.
24 A. And then would go sleep over at his house,
25 but we were still living at the Soto apartment.
26 Q. When you got back from Neverland Ranch,
27 you’re back at your grandparents’ place, all right.
28 Now, did you remain at your grandparents’ or did you 692
 

 
1 go somewhere else.
2 A. We went to Jay Jackson’s house.
3 Q. And do you remember how many days you were
4 there.
5 A. We didn’t sleep over that night.
6 Q. How about the next night.
7 A. I think that’s the day that the ladies came
8 over from -- the social workers.
9 Q. Do you ever remember --
10 MR. MESEREAU: Excuse me.

23 stayed in, it’s the one that has the kitchen and the
24 bed that you just talked about for the ladies and
25 gentlemen of the jury.
26 A. Yes.
27 MR. SNEDDON: Now, I have one last
28 photograph, Your Honor, I neglected to get marked, 719
 

 
1 or identified. It’s People’s 29.
2 Q. Okay. Now, do you recognize the person
3 depicted in that photograph.
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. People’s 29 for identification.

20 Q. All right. So that’s the individual who
21 picked you up and took you to his house.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And did the filming.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Okay. There we go. So that’s Hamid.
26 A. Yes.
27 THE BAILIFF: Judge, it’s 1:15.
28 MR. SNEDDON: You can take that down. We’re 720
 

 
1 not going to ask any more questions on that.
2 Q. Now I want to ask you some questions about
3 your time at the ranch. Okay.
4 A. (Nods head up and down.)
5 Q. During the time that you were staying at
6 Neverland Ranch, did you ever see your brothers
7 drink.
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. On how many occasions.
10 A. Once.
11 Q. Could you tell the ladies and gentlemen of
12 the jury, where was that when you saw it.
13 A. It was in the arcade. It was -- if you move
14 a jukebox out of the way, it leads into a staircase.
15 You go down the staircase, you make a right, there’s
16 another room and it has like sleeping bags and
17 stuff. And you go into a little tiny room that’s --
18 if you go into that room, make a right, there’s a
19 little tiny room and then that’s the wine cellar.
20 Q. Okay.
21 A. That’s where Mr. Jackson, my brothers and
22 Aldo were.
23 THE COURT: Would you like to take a break.
24 MR. SNEDDON: (Nods head up and down.)
25 THE COURT: All right. We’ll take one.
26 (Recess taken.)
27 THE COURT: Go ahead.
28 MR. SNEDDON: Judge, may I make a request of 721
 

 
1 the Court.
2 THE COURT: Yes.
3 MR. SNEDDON: I understand there may be some
4 difficulty with some of the people being able to
5 hear the witness, and that if that’s the case, maybe
6 somebody -- if it’s a lawyer or the jury, they could
7 raise their hand and let us know so we can take
8 action accordingly.
9 THE COURT: Yes.
10 MR. SNEDDON: Okay. Thank you.
11 THE COURT: We’re working on that problem.
12 We’re going to try and get a different mike for
13 them.
14 MR. SNEDDON: That would be great. Thank
15 you.
16 Q. I think where we left off was at Neverland
17 Ranch.
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. And you had described to us the arcade and
20 the cellar inside the arcade.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. And I think what I asked you was, did you
23 ever see your brothers drink at the ranch.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. On how many occasions.
26 A. Once.
27 Q. And where.
28 A. It was in the wine cellar under the arcade. 722
 

 
1 Q. And who else was present at that time.
2 A. Mr. Jackson, Gavin, Star and Aldo.
3 Q. And what was going on when you -- did you
4 walk down there with them, or did you join them
5 there.
6 A. No, I had always seen people walking down
7 there and they would come up with cups. But I never
8 knew what was really down there until one time I
9 walked in, and I just followed them when they were
10 going down.
11 Q. And this is the one time you’re talking
12 about.
13 A. Yeah.
14 Q. All right. When you followed them in there,
15 tell us what you saw.
16 A. When I walked into the wine cellar, I saw
17 Mr. Jackson pouring wine into cups.
18 Q. Into what.
19 A. Into cups.
20 Q. Lean forward. I’m sorry, we got to do that.

25 A. Yeah.
26 Q. Did you see anybody drink out of it.
27 A. Yeah.
28 Q. Who drank. 723

2 Q. All right. Anybody else.
3 A. Well, Mr. Jackson was drinking also.
4 Q. Did you get offered something to drink.
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And did you take it.
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. And what was it.
9 A. It was wine.
10 Q. What makes you think it was wine.
11 A. I don’t know. Because it was clear and -- I
12 don’t know anything about liquor, so I don’t know.
13 Q. How did it taste.
14 A. Funny and, I don’t know, weird.
15 Q. All right. Is that -- were there any other
16 occasions while you were at the ranch that you saw
17 your brothers drinking with Mr. Jackson.
18 A. No.
19 Q. Were there any other occasions at the ranch
20 where you drank.
21 A. No.
22 Q. How long were you downstairs in the wine
23 cellar.
24 A. Ten minutes.
25 Q. Did they all leave in ten minutes or did
26 just you leave.
27 A. Well, we all went up.
28 Q. Where did you go. 724
 

 
1 A. Back up to the arcade.
2 Q. Did you take your cups with you, or did you
3 leave them down there. Tell me what you did with
4 your cup.
5 A. Well, I drank some, and then we went
6 upstairs and I just left it on the counter.
7 Q. A counter where.
8 A. In the -- in the arcade there’s a counter,
9 and you could just put it -- I just put it right
10 there, and there’s like a slushy machine there next
11 to it.
12 Q. A what.
13 A. A slushy machine next to it. It’s kind of
14 like -- I don’t know how to describe it. It’s just
15 a counter, and then behind it there’s like a fake
16 cash register and stuff.
17 Q. You put your cup there.
18 A. Uh-huh.
19 Q. Now, with regard to the other individuals
20 that were in the cellar, let’s talk about them one
21 by one. Okay.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. You came up the stairs and put your cup on
24 the counter there.
25 A. Yeah.
26 Q. With regard to the defendant, Michael
27 Jackson, did he come up the stairs at the same time
28 as you. 725
 

 
1 A. Well, yeah, one after another.
2 Q. And so everybody came upstairs.
3 A. Yeah.
4 Q. Everybody at the same time.
5 A. Yeah.
6 Q. Did -- when you all got upstairs and you
7 were all back in this arcade area, what went on
8 then.
9 A. They just listened -- well, we all listened
10 to music and then they were playing some games.
11 Q. By “they,” who do you mean.
12 A. Well, all of us. Gavin, Star, and then Mr.
13 Jackson was listening to music.
14 Q. Did Mr. Jackson stay there.
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Now, with regard to the cups that everybody
17 had downstairs, can you tell us whether anybody
18 besides yourself brought their cups upstairs.
19 A. Everybody did.
20 Q. When you were up there, did you see whether
21 or not the people who brought their cups upstairs
22 continued to use those cups and continued to drink.
23 A. I saw them sipping on it and drinking it. I
24 don’t know when they stopped or -- but from what I
25 saw, they kept drinking it.
26 Q. Did you see your brother Gavin drinking
27 upstairs.
28 A. Yeah. 726
 

 
1 Q. And your brother Star.
2 A. Yeah.
3 Q. And Aldo.
4 A. Yeah.
5 Q. And how about the defendant.
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. How long were you up there in the arcade
8 with them that time.
9 A. Not very long because it was already night
10 and I was tired, so I didn’t stay there very long.
11 Q. When you left the arcade that night, can you
12 tell us whether or not anybody left with you.
13 A. No, they stood there.
14 Q. I’m sorry.
15 A. No, they stood there.
16 Q. Now, when -- when you came up the stairs out
17 of the cellar --
18 A. Yeah.
19 Q. -- okay. - is there a door to that cellar.
20 A. What do you mean, like “door”. Like when
21 you walk down the stairs, I don’t remember seeing a
22 door. That’s not the actual wine cellar. You got
23 to go to the right, and there’s a little room and
24 that’s where the wine bottles are at.
25 Q. Okay. When you came back up out of the wine
26 cellar into the other room and up the stairs into
27 the arcade - okay. --
28 A. They just put the juke box back. 727
 

 
1 Q. Pardon.
2 A. They just put the juke box back. That’s
3 what blocks the staircase.
4 Q. That’s what I’m asking. You’re way ahead of
5 me. So there is a juke box up there.
6 A. Yeah.
7 Q. And where did it go.
8 A. It blocks the staircase.
9 Q. Okay. And did they put it back.
10 A. Yeah.
11 Q. Do you remember who put it back.
12 A. No. I don’t remember. I just remember it
13 got put back.
14 Q. Now, during the time that you were at
15 Neverland Valley Ranch, did you ever go into Mr.
16 Jackson’s bedroom.
17 A. During the stay at Neverland Ranch, yes, I
18 did once.
19 Q. How many times.
20 A. Once.
21 Q. And do you remember when it was that you
22 went into his bedroom, in terms of how long you’d
23 been there once you got back from Miami.
24 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Misstates the
25 evidence; leading question.
26 THE COURT: Sustained as to misstates the
27 evidence. Just rephrase it.
28 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: You told the ladies and 728
 

 
1 gentlemen of the jury that you had been in Mr.
2 Jackson’s bedroom on one occasion.
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. This is at the ranch.
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. All right. When, in point in time, was it
7 that you went into his bedroom. Was it in the
8 daytime or in the nighttime.
9 A. It was in the nighttime.
10 Q. And was it before -- was it after you
11 arrived back from Miami.
12 A. Yeah.
13 Q. So it was during that time frame.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Now, would you tell us the circumstances
16 under which you got into Mr. Jackson’s bedroom.
17 A. I went after the boys, because there’s no
18 way I could get into the room unless it was after
19 them.
20 Q. Why is that.
21 A. Because there’s a code to get into his room.
22 Q. Did you have the code.
23 A. No.
24 Q. And you said the boys went -- you followed
25 the boys.
26 A. Yes.
27 Q. Was there anybody with the boys.
28 A. Aldo was there, I think. I think Mr. 729
 

 
1 Jackson was already in the room. I’m not sure.
2 Q. So you followed them into the room, in any
3 case.
4 A. Yeah.
5 Q. Okay. Describe what you saw when you got
6 into the room.
7 A. There’s a couch.
8 Q. Lean into the mike. Nice and loud, please.
9 A. There’s a couch there. There’s a music
10 thing. There’s a little game that -- that’s all I
11 remember. And then if you go straight back, there’s
12 his bathroom, and then right up next to the door of
13 the bathroom there’s, like, a desk and it has a
14 phone on there.
15 Q. Now, when you followed the boys into the
16 room, what part of the room did you go into at
17 first.
18 A. Just that front area. I guess it’s like a
19 living-room-type.
20 Q. And how long were you there.
21 A. Ten minutes. Not that long.
22 Q. And Mr. Jackson was there.
23 A. Yeah. I don’t remember. I just remember us
24 like sitting and me looking around, like, because
25 I’d never been in there before.
26 Q. Okay. Did you ever go upstairs.
27 A. Yes. I went upstairs after.
28 Q. And when you got upstairs, describe the 730
 

 
1 upstairs to me.
2 A. There’s a bed in the middle and then there’s
3 a little nightstand. There’s a bunch of figurines.
4 When you first walk up the stairs, like, a bunch of
5 like toys and like figurines right here. And then
6 there’s a screen that can be pulled down to watch
7 movies. That’s all I remember.
8 Q. Do you remember whether the screen was down
9 or up at the time you went in.
10 A. I think it was down already.
11 Q. Now, who was in the bedroom.
12 A. Mr. Jackson, Gavin, Star, Aldo and me.
13 Q. Okay. Where was Mr. Jackson in the room.
14 A. Well, after we all got settled, Mr. Jackson
15 was laying on the bed, and then Gavin was next to
16 him, and then Star. That’s what I remember.
17 Q. Do you remember where Aldo was.
18 A. I think he was sitting on like the corner of
19 the bed. And I was sitting on a chair.
20 Q. Go ahead.
21 A. I was sitting on a chair.
22 Q. When you walked into that room that time,
23 did you see any alcohol in the room.
24 A. Yes. I saw empty bottles or half full
25 bottles.
26 Q. Of what.
27 A. Of alcohol -- I know the shape of bottles,
28 but I don’t know what they were, like the names. 731
 

 
1 Q. Where did you see it.
2 A. Some were on the nightstand. Some were on
3 the desk, like a stand where the computer was. Some
4 were on that, where the figurines were.
5 Q. Okay. I’ve got a couple more photographs
6 I’m going to show you before you get to step down.
7 People’s 75, do you recognize that.
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. And is that an accurate depiction of what
10 the room looked like.
11 A. Yeah. It’s real -- messier.
12 Q. So we’ll talk about that in just a moment.
13 And People’s 76, do you recognize that.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. And is that an accurate depiction.
16 A. Yeah. There’s some extra things, but that’s
17 pretty much how it was.
18 MR. SNEDDON: Okay. Move that 75 and 76 be
19 admitted into evidence, Your Honor.
20 THE COURT: They’re admitted.
21 MR. SNEDDON: All right. I’d like to have
22 75 put up on....
23 Q. All right. With regard to the exhibit,
24 People’s 75, do you recognize that.
25 A. Yes.
26 Q. And what is that.
27 A. That’s where I kept saying where there was
28 figurines there. 732
 

 
1 Q. Lean into the mike.
2 A. That’s where I kept saying there was
3 figurines at, like in that area.
4 Q. Now, do you see things that are different in
5 that photograph now than when you were there, that
6 you recall.
7 A. I don’t remember seeing that T.V. It wasn’t
8 as messy.
9 Q. Okay. Now, do you see locations in that
10 photograph, People’s 75, in which you saw the
11 bottles that you thought were liquor.
12 A. Like there was some right here. There was
13 some, like, where there was enough stability to put
14 them. Like anywhere there was, like, stability to
15 put one, there -- because it looks different. I
16 don’t know.
17 Q. Go ahead and put the light on where you put
18 it the first time, and let’s talk about that.
19 A. Like, they were on the nightstands.
20 Q. Okay. And leave the light on. Okay. On
21 the nightstand on the left-hand side of the bed.
22 A. And there was some on the other side
23 nightstand, too.
24 Q. Were there any bottles located on this side
25 of the room that’s depicted in People’s 75, that you
26 recall.
27 A. Yeah. There was some -- well, when -- this
28 was not as messy. There was some right here, and 733
 

 
1 then there was one or two right there.
2 Q. Okay. Let’s go to the next exhibit. That
3 exhibit is People’s 76. Do you see that.
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. All right. Now, is there anything that’s in
6 that photograph that wasn’t there when you were
7 there.
8 A. The crib and this was -- I don’t remember
9 seeing that.
10 Q. So by “this,” do you mean there’s a little
11 object that looks like it has a screen that’s
12 directly underneath a lamp or between a lamp and the
13 crib.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. And that wasn’t there, to your recollection.
16 A. I don’t remember.
17 Q. And what was the other thing.
18 A. The crib wasn’t there.
19 Q. All right. Now, indicate to the ladies and
20 gentlemen of the jury -- could you indicate where it
21 was that Mr. Jackson was inside the room when you
22 saw him.
23 A. Right here.
24 Q. And where was Gavin.
25 A. Next to him.
26 Q. So let’s go back to Mr. Jackson. If you’d
27 put the red light up there again. On People’s 76,
28 you’re indicating on the far left-hand side of the 734
 

 
1 bed.
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. And next to him was Gavin.
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. And then where was your brother Star.
6 A. He was on the other end, but I’m trying to
7 remember. I think his son was there too. Like in
8 between Star and Gavin. I’m trying to remember.
9 Q. All right. Go ahead.
10 A. Yeah.
11 Q. And where on that exhibit, People’s No. 76,
12 did you see bottles.
13 A. There was some more on this nightstand, and
14 then if you face the other way.
15 Q. Lean into the microphone. Go ahead.
16 A. If you face the other way, like, facing that
17 way, there was a computer to the left of the T.V.
18 screen. It used to be a computer right there.
19 There was some right there.
20 Q. And what was the computer on.
21 A. On a stand, I guess. I don’t remember.
22 Q. All right. Do you remember how long you
23 were there in the room with Mr. Jackson and the boys
24 before you left.
25 A. 30, 45 minutes.
26 Q. Couldn’t hear you.
27 A. 30, 45 minutes.
28 Q. Do you remember what was going on. 735
 

 
1 A. Well, we started watching a movie.
2 Q. Do you remember the movie.
3 A. No. It was just -- I remember it had
4 subtitles. I just remember it had subtitles.
5 Q. And how were you watching the movie. Was it
6 on the --
7 A. On that big screen that you pull down.
8 Q. Okay. Now, when you left Mr. Jackson’s
9 room, did the boys leave with you or did you go by
10 yourself.
11 A. I left by myself.
12 Q. Did anybody else leave with you at that
13 time.
14 A. No.
15 Q. Where did you go.
16 A. I went to my room.
17 MR. SNEDDON: Now, we can take that down
18 now, if you want. And turn the lights on, would be
19 fine, Your Honor.
20 Q. You told the ladies and gentlemen of the
21 jury that there was a time that you went to that
22 Calabasas hotel that you identified in those
23 photographs.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Now, while you were at that particular
26 hotel - okay. - did you go anywhere with Frank Tyson
27 or Vinnie Amen.
28 A. Yes. 736
 

 
1 Q. Where did you go.
2 A. They took us to go get passports.
3 Q. Did you go with them.
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Where else.
6 A. That’s all I remember right now.
7 Q. Did you ever go shopping.
8 A. Oh, we did go shopping one time.
9 Q. Where did you go.
10 A. We went to like an outlet place to go pick
11 up some luggages. And then we went to the mall and
12 picked up some clothes.
13 Q. And what was the reason you went shopping.
14 A. They told us we were going to Brazil.
15 Q. I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear you.
16 A. Because they told us we were going to
17 Brazil.
18 Q. Who told you that.
19 A. Frank. And then earlier on Dieter had
20 already said that.
21 Q. Did they say why you were going to Brazil.
22 A. Because they said that -- to get us away
23 because there was death threats on us.
24 Q. Who told you that.
25 A. Dieter. And then Frank told me another
26 time, also.
27 Q. And you mentioned earlier in your testimony
28 that you had made a trip to The Laugh Factory. 737
 

 
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. Okay. Where is The Laugh Factory; do you
3 know.
4 A. It’s in Hollywood.
5 Q. And do you remember -- was it during the
6 time you were at Calabasas or some other time.
7 A. I think it was during that time.
8 Q. Now, who went to The Laugh Factory.
9 A. We all -- Vinnie, my mom, my brothers and me
10 went to The Laugh Factory. But my mom and Gavin
11 were the only ones that got off.
12 Q. “Got off.” What do you mean, “got off”.
13 A. Got off the car and went to go see Jamie.
14 Because Vinnie told us to stay --
15 Q. Just slow down. Let’s take it one at a
16 time. Okay. Make sure we got all the characters
17 here.
18 You got into a car. You left from
19 Calabasas, and you went to The Laugh Factory.
20 A. Yeah.
21 Q. Who’s in the car.
22 A. Vinnie, me, my mom, and my brothers.
23 Q. All right. Now, you get to The Laugh
24 Factory. Who leaves the car.
25 A. My mom and my brother Gavin.
26 Q. Okay. Now, did Vinnie tell you something at
27 that point in time.
28 A. He told me and Star to stay. 738
 

 
1 Q. Did he say why.
2 A. No.
3 Q. So your mother and Gavin went inside.
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Now, did you ever go inside during that
6 trip.
7 A. Yes, because Vinnie -- sorry.
8 Q. That’s all right. We’ll take it one step at
9 a time. So you went inside.
10 Now, how long had it been before -- how long
11 were you in the car with your brother and with this
12 Vinnie person that you’ve identified in the
13 photograph before you went inside.
14 A. About 15 minutes. About 15 minutes.
15 Q. Okay. Now, what happened.
16 A. Um --
17 Q. Why was it that you went inside.
18 A. Because Vinnie kept saying, “Where’s your
19 mom. Where’s your mom. Go get her.” Because he
20 was, I don’t know, impatient. He wanted us to
21 leave.
22 Q. Did he know, to your knowledge, who your
23 mother was meeting with.
24 A. Just Jamie.
25 Q. Now, when you went -- you told the jury you
26 went inside.
27 Do you want some water.
28 A. Yeah. 739
 

 
1 Q. All right. Did Star go in with you.
2 A. No.
3 Q. Why.
4 A. Vinnie told him to stay.
5 Q. So he let you go, but he kept Star.
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. All right. Now, you went inside. And when
8 you went inside, who did you see.
9 A. I saw Gavin, my mom and Bill.
10 Q. Did -- okay. Anybody else.
11 A. That was it.
12 Q. Now, the person you’ve identified as Bill --
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. -- had you ever met him before.
15 A. Never.
16 Q. This is the first time you met him.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. How long were you inside with your mother
19 and Gavin and this person you’ve identified as Bill.
20 A. Five minutes, because I just ran and told --
21 I just ran in and told my mom what Vinnie told me to
22 tell her.
23 Q. So after that, did you leave The Laugh
24 Factory.
25 A. Yes. And I went back outside.
26 Q. Who came with you.
27 A. My mom and Gavin stood there a little bit
28 longer and then they came out. 740
 

 
1 Q. Did -- while you were at the Laugh Factory
2 that day, did you ever see Jamie Masada.
3 A. Yeah, he was sitting right there.
4 Q. Right where.
5 A. With my mom and Gavin and Bill.
6 Q. So he was there.
7 A. Yeah.
8 Q. So how long do you think in total that it
9 was that your mother was indeed with this person
10 Bill and Jamie Masada.
11 A. I think about 30 minutes.
12 Q. Now, after you came out of The Laugh
13 Factory, where -- did you get back in the car.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. And your mother and Gavin came out at some
16 point, I would assume.
17 A. Yeah.
18 Q. You all got in the car.
19 A. Yeah.
20 Q. And where did you go; do you remember.
21 A. I think we went back in the hotel in
22 Calabasas.
23 Q. Now, let’s talk about the Calabasas hotel
24 for just a moment. Okay.
25 A. Okay.
26 Q. Do you remember any of the buildings or
27 locations that were around the Calabasas hotel.
28 A. There was a shopping center across the 741
 

 
1 street, I think. It had like a Ralph’s in it, I
2 think. I don’t really remember. I just saw it when
3 we were driving by.
4 Q. Did you ever go over to the shopping center.
5 A. No.
6 Q. Why.
7 A. We were -- didn’t leave the hotel room.
8 Q. Why.
9 A. I don’t know. Vinnie and Frank said to --
10 not to leave.
11 Q. Did you ever go down -- does the
12 Calabasas -- does it have a swimming pool.
13 A. Yeah.
14 Q. Did you ever go down swimming.
15 A. No.
16 Q. Why.
17 A. Just -- we couldn’t leave the room, so -- we
18 didn’t even bother to ask, because we know it would
19 be “No.”
20 Q. Does the -- to your knowledge, does the
21 lobby of the hotel have like these machines where
22 you can get Cokes and candy or treats or stuff in
23 it.
24 A. They have like -- set out on a counter, like
25 coffee and little muffins and stuff.
26 Q. And did you ever go down to get any of that.
27 A. Yeah. Yeah.
28 Q. And is that when you saw this person sitting 742
 

 
1 in the lobby.
2 A. Well, when we had first got there, Frank --
3 Vinnie introduced us to him and said that he was
4 supposed to be there to keep us safe and stuff.
5 Q. Did you ever go downstairs to try to get
6 anything.
7 A. Yeah. We did one time.
8 Q. What happened.
9 A. They just said not to leave the room. They
10 seemed kind of irritated about it.
11 Q. Who’s that.
12 A. Frank.
13 Q. And when you say that they took you to get a
14 passport, did you actually physically go with
15 somebody to do that.
16 A. Yeah. Vinnie’s the one that took us.
17 Q. And do you know where you went.
18 A. No. All I know was it was an office place.
19 I don’t know.
20 Q. And were there any other places that you
21 went; do you recall.
22 A. Other than to go get clothes and luggage,
23 no.
24 Q. All right. In that big binder that’s right
25 there in front of you -- why don’t we just clear the
26 area --
27 Your Honor, if you don’t mind, I could
28 just -- 743
 

 
1 Counsel.
2 (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel
3 table.)
4 MR. SNEDDON: Your Honor, there have been --
5 I will direct the Court’s attention to the book that
6 it has, and in particular to Exhibits 260 and 261
7 that have been premarked for identification
8 purposes.
9 THE COURT: I have them.
10 MR. SNEDDON: And 262, Your Honor, is a
11 series of passport applications that have been duly
12 certified by the United States Government. And, in
13 fact, they’ve been signed off by Colin Powell. May
14 those be admitted into evidence.
15 MR. MESEREAU: No objection, Your Honor.
16 THE COURT: They’re admitted.
17 MR. SNEDDON: And then with regard to the
18 second set, Your Honor, they are a set of documents
19 of visas from the Republic of Brazil. And those are
20 also accompanied by the certification of the
21 Brazilian consulate. And I ask that those be
22 admitted into evidence as 262.
23 MR. MESEREAU: May I just see those for a
24 second.
25 MR. SNEDDON: Sure.
26 (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel
27 table.)
28 MR. MESEREAU: No objection, Your Honor. 744
 

 
1 THE COURT: It’s admitted.
2 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Okay. Now, why don’t you
3 let me have these.
4 MR. SNEDDON: Your Honor, with the Court’s
5 permission and counsel’s permission, I would like to
6 use the originals of these documents to be displayed
7 on the Elmo, rather than copies. Because the
8 copies, you know, the Xeroxing --
9 MR. MESEREAU: No objection, Your Honor.
10 MR. SNEDDON: Is it okay -- I would ask some
11 questions to the witness, and perhaps I could give
12 the witness the Xerox copies which I’ve shown to
13 counsel with the Bates stamp numbers.
14 MR. MESEREAU: No objection to that.
15 THE COURT: I have a question about my
16 numbers on the exhibits. Lorna, is it --
17 THE CLERK: I have a question also, Judge.
18 THE COURT: According to our premarked
19 exhibits, 261 and 262 are not --
20 MR. SNEDDON: No, it’s 260 and 261. If I
21 misspoke myself, I apologize.
22 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
23 MR. SANGER: Excuse me. Just for
24 bookkeeping purposes, Your Honor, what has been
25 admitted is 260 and 261 and not 262.
26 THE COURT: Correct.
27 MR. SANGER: Thank you.
28 MR. SNEDDON: With the Court’s permission, 745
 

 
1 I wanted to use the Elmo. I don’t know if you need
2 to use a toggle switch or do something --
3 THE BAILIFF: Input four.
4 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: All right. We have up on
5 the board Document 260. Yes, 260. All right. Do

8 Q. Do you recognize the photograph of the
9 person on that document.
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. That’s you, huh.
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. All right. Now, with regard to the writing
14 that is on that particular document, is that your
15 handwriting.
16 A. No.
17 Q. With regard to the signature where it says
18 “Applicant” underneath the photograph, is that your
19 handwriting.
20 A. I don’t remember signing it.
21 Q. Does it look like your handwriting.
22 A. No.
23 Q. With regard to -- do you see on the document
24 the -- just a moment. Looking on the document, 260,
25 right over in this area here; do you see that.
26 A. Yeah.
27 Q. Does it indicate the destination there,
28 where you’re going. 746
 

 
1 A. Yeah.
2 Q. What’s it say.

7 or France.
8 A. No.
9 Q. Did you see this document filled out.
10 A. Yeah.
11 Q. Who filled it out.
12 A. Vinnie did.
13 Q. Did you give him the information to put in
14 there.
15 A. I don’t remember. I think he asked my mom
16 for it.
17 Q. And do you know why you were making this
18 application.
19 A. Well, they told us we were going to Brazil.
20 Q. Were you interested in going to Brazil.
21 A. Not really.
22 Q. Okay. Now, why don’t you direct your
23 attention to 261 for just a second, if you would,
24 the other document. Okay. Do you have that in
25 mind.
26 A. Yes.
27 Q. That’s your photograph again, correct.
28 A. Yes. 747
 

 
1 Q. Do you remember having that photograph
2 taken.
3 A. Yeah, now I remember. They took us to
4 Walgreen’s to take pictures.
5 Q. When you say “they,” who took you to
6 Walgreen’s.
7 A. Vinnie did.
8 Q. So it was just Vinnie.
9 A. Yeah.
10 Q. And where was the Walgreen’s.
11 A. It was near Calabasas. I don’t remember
12 where.
13 Q. And who did they take to get the
14 photographs.
15 A. Me, my mom and my brothers.
16 Q. All at the same time.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. All right. Now, on this particular
19 information, the -- on this particular document that
20 we’re referring to, 261, there’s lot of printing on
21 it. Is that your printing.
22 A. No.
23 Q. You didn’t fill that out.
24 A. No.
25 Q. And the information for this, do you know
26 where it came from.
27 A. Um --
28 Q. Were you present when it was put on there. 748
 

 
1 A. Yeah.
2 Q. All right. And how did that information get
3 conveyed onto this document. Who wrote it.
4 A. Well, Vinnie wrote it, but he was asking my
5 mom.
6 Q. He didn’t ask you; he asked your mother.
7 A. Yeah.
8 Q. Okay. All right. I think we can --
9 Wait just a second, Your Honor. We’re going
10 to move the document up just a little farther.
11 Okay. Do you recognize the signature at the
12 bottom by the seal. Right there. And we’re talking
13 now about the lower left-hand portion of the
14 document, if you’re looking at it from the top.
15 A. I think that’s Vinnie’s signature. I’m not
16 sure.
17 Q. I couldn’t hear you.
18 A. I think that’s Vinnie’s signature. I’m not
19 sure.
20 Q. Okay. All right.
21 Let’s turn the lights on now, Your Honor.
22 Now, you said that during the time that you
23 were at Calabasas, that you recall at least one trip
24 where you went shopping for clothes and a suitcase,
25 something like that.
26 A. Yeah.
27 Q. Okay. Now, from -- did you have clothes
28 with you at the ranch. 749
 

 
1 A. Yeah, but -- a couple. Not really anything.
2 Q. And where were your belongings.
3 A. They were in my guest room. Where I was
4 staying at.
5 Q. All right. And then with regard to your
6 other belongings that weren’t at the ranch, where
7 were they.
8 A. They were at my -- some of them were at
9 my -- at the Soto apartment. And most of them were
10 more at my grandmother’s house.
11 Q. Now, why would some of them have been at
12 your grandmother’s house.
13 A. Because I had to stay with my grandmother,
14 because she needed me.
15 Q. So you were still going to school at --
16 A. Roosevelt.
17 Q. Okay.
18 A. Uh-huh.
19 Q. Why did your grandmother need you.
20 A. Because she had gotten surgery on her ankle.
21 They had to move something - I forgot what it was -
22 and she couldn’t really walk. And my grandfather’s
23 a truck driver, so she didn’t have anybody but me.
24 Her other granddaughter, she lives too far. And I’m
25 her only other granddaughter.
26 Q. Speaking of your grandmother and your
27 grandfather. Your grandfather’s a trucker.
28 A. Yeah. 750
 

 
1 Q. Who does he work for.
2 A. He works for Ralph’s.
3 Q. How long has he done that, to your
4 knowledge.
5 A. Since he was 18 years old.
6 Q. And your grandmother.
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Does she speak English.
9 A. No. Not at all.
10 Q. But your grandfather does.
11 A. Yeah, he speaks English and Spanish.
12 Q. Now, when -- do you remember how many days
13 it was that you stayed at the Calabasas Inn.
14 A. Three days. Four days. I don’t remember.
15 About that.
16 Q. I’m sorry.
17 A. About three days, I think.
18 Q. Do you remember whether you were in the same
19 room the entire time.
20 A. No, we went to another one.
21 Q. So do you remember the room numbers at all.
22 A. No. I just remember one was on top of the
23 other.
24 Q. So one was on a higher floor. They were not
25 on the same floor.
26 A. No.
27 Q. Okay. Let’s do it this way: With regard to
28 the first room you went into, was it on the lower 751
 

 
1 floor or the higher floor.
2 A. I think it was on the one on the higher
3 floor.
4 Q. And then you went to the one on the lower
5 floor.
6 A. The next floor.
7 Q. Were one of the rooms bigger than the
8 others.
9 A. Yeah.
10 Q. What was the difference.
11 A. One of them had one more bed. Yeah.
12 Q. Did they both have kitchens.
13 A. Yeah, they both had kitchens.
14 Q. And do you know, when you moved floors,
15 whether or not, to your personal knowledge, Vinnie
16 or Frank changed their room.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And how did they change their room. I don’t
19 mean how. They didn’t go downstairs. But, I mean,
20 were they on the same floor as you folks.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Now, when you go back -- after Calabasas.
23 You’re finished at Calabasas. Okay. Let me just
24 ask you a few more questions about Calabasas.
25 You’re at Calabasas. And I saw in that
26 photograph that you identified that it has a kitchen
27 unit.
28 A. Yes. 752
 

 
1 Q. Did your mom cook while you were there.
2 A. No.
3 Q. So you didn’t use the kitchen unit.
4 A. No.
5 Q. So how did you get your meals.
6 A. They would either bring it to us -- I think
7 one time we did go out to eat. But most of the time
8 everything was brought to us by the bodyguard guy.
9 Q. So you were in your room and they brought
10 the food.
11 A. Yeah.
12 Q. All right. Now, after Calabasas - after you
13 left the Calabasas Inn, okay. - tell the ladies and
14 gentlemen of the jury where you went.
15 A. We went back to Neverland.
16 Q. Back to where.
17 A. Neverland.
18 Q. And how did you get there.
19 A. They took us. Vinnie did.
20 Q. Now, during the time -- let me go back to
21 just one point. During the time that you were at
22 the Calabasas Inn, you’ve told us that Vinnie was
23 there. Was Frank Tyson ever there.
24 A. Yeah, he came at one point.
25 Q. Do you remember how long he was there for.
26 A. I don’t remember. I think a day or two.
27 Q. So it was not on a consistent basis.
28 A. No, it was mostly Vinnie that stood there. 753
 

 
1 Q. Okay. When I asked that, I mean, was he
2 there all of that day, or was he in and out that
3 day. To your knowledge, what you saw.
4 A. I don’t know. We were in our room.
5 Q. Okay. Fair enough. So you were taken back
6 to the ranch by Vinnie.
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. And when you get back to the ranch, do you
9 remember whether it’s dark or whether it’s daylight.
10 A. I think it was daylight.
11 Q. And when you got to the ranch, where did you
12 go.
13 A. Went to go put our stuff away. And I went
14 to put my stuff in the room, guest room.
15 Q. So you were back in the guest room.

3 Q. So after this trip to the toy store, where
4 did you go.
5 A. Back to the ranch.
6 Q. Now, with your brother -- his cancer’s been
7 in remission, you said.
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. And to your knowledge, does your brother
10 still have to go back and see the doctor
11 periodically.
12 A. Yes, he does.
13 Q. How often.
14 A. Well, now that they --
15 Q. Let me --
16 A. Back then.
17 Q. Yeah, back then.
18 A. Okay. He would have to go every so many
19 weeks. Because they were monitoring his kidney.
20 Q. And was there something that he had to do in
21 connection with that monitoring.
22 A. Yes, he did.
23 Q. What was that.
24 A. He would have to pee in a bottle for two
25 days or 24 hours, something like that.
26 Q. And have you ever seen this bottle.
27 A. Yes, I have.
28 Q. Could you describe it to us. 757
 

 
1 A. It’s about this height, of this.
2 Q. Of the water container there.
3 A. Yes. And then it has a thick handle, it’s
4 plastic. And it’s got a real secure, like, top.
5 Q. Now, while you were at the ranch, did you
6 receive any information - don’t tell me what it
7 was - that caused you to go looking for your
8 brothers about the trip to the hospital.
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. From who was it that you got the
11 information.
12 A. My mother.
13 Q. And did you do something as a result of that
14 information.
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. And what did you do.
17 A. I went to Mr. Jackson’s -- because there’s
18 two doors. A door that goes straight into the room
19 and there’s a door that goes into a hallway that
20 goes into his room. That door, I was knocking and
21 pounding on.
22 Q. Okay. When you say “that door,” I’m not
23 exactly clear yet. Talk about that again.
24 A. Because there’s a door that goes straight
25 into his room. That’s the one that has the code on
26 it.
27 Q. Right.
28 A. Then there’s a door down -- that’s on the 758
 

 
1 hallway, in the front of the hallway. That door was
2 locked.
3 Q. Okay.
4 A. So I was pounding on that door.
5 Q. You were pounding on that door. So you
6 never got into the hallway.
7 A. No, it was locked.
8 Q. And did anybody ever come to the door.
9 A. No.
10 Q. Did you go back -- where did you go after
11 that.
12 A. I went to my mom and told her that, “They’re
13 not letting me in”; that, “They’re not answering.”
14 Q. Now, after the -- after -- the day after the
15 incident where you were pounding on the door -
16 okay. - did you see your mother leave the ranch.
17 A. Yeah, her, Gavin and Vinnie were taking
18 Gavin to his doctor’s appointment.
19 Q. Did you actually see them leave.
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Do you know whether it was in the morning or
22 the afternoon or --
23 A. It was in the morning.
24 Q. And did you actually see them get into the
25 car.
26 A. Yes.
27 Q. Did you see whether or not at that point in
28 time Gavin had his bottle full of urine. 759
 

 
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. And who was actually physically carrying the
3 bottle at that point.
4 A. I think Gavin was carrying it at the
5 beginning, but he passed it to my mom.
6 Q. Now, did you see where they were seated in
7 the car.
8 A. Gavin was sitting in the back and my mom was
9 in the front and Vinnie was driving.
10 Q. And was it at this point -- when your mom
11 was in the front of the car, could you tell us
12 whether or not she had the bottle at that point.
13 A. I think she did, because right before they
14 got in the car, that’s when Gavin passed the bottle
15 to him -- to my mom.
16 Q. So I take it you just saw them drive off.
17 A. Yeah.
18 Q. Now, later that day, did you see your
19 brother Gavin.
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. After he had gone to the hospital.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Was he back on the ranch.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Did you see him drive up or --
26 A. Vinnie drove him up.
27 Q. Did you see that.
28 A. Yeah. 760
 

 
1 Q. So where were you when you saw Vinnie and
2 your brother come back.
3 A. I was in front of the main house.
4 Q. Was your mother with them.
5 A. No.
6 Q. All right. When your brother got out of the
7 car, where did he go.
8 A. I think he went to go look for Mr. Jackson.
9 Q. I’m sorry.
10 A. I think he went to go look for Mr. Jackson.
11 I don’t remember.
12 Q. But your mother wasn’t there.
13 A. No.
14 Q. Now, during the time that you were at the
15 ranch, and the boys were at the ranch, and Mr.
16 Jackson was at the ranch --
17 A. Yeah.
18 Q. -- talking about that period once you come
19 back from Miami. All right. Just speaking for
20 yourself. Okay. Was there a difference in the

12 want to be near me. He didn’t really want to really
13 talk to me. He didn’t really want to talk to me.
14 He didn’t want to be near me. It just felt weird.
15 And me being his older sister, I just knew
16 something. I don’t know. I don’t know. Just felt
17 weird.
18 Q. Anything else about his behavior that
19 changed, that you noticed.
20 A. He didn’t really want to talk to me. He was
21 very distant. He just didn’t want to even see my
22 mom. He just thought differently.

24 from the hospital trip - okay. - at some point in
