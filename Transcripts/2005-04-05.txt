13

14 CROSS-EXAMINATION (Continued)

15 BY MR. MESEREAU:

16 Q. Mr. Francia, we were discussing yesterday

17 your first interview with two police detectives

18 which took place on November 3rd, 1993, okay?

19 A. Okay.

20 Q. That’s where we left off.

21 Now, did you discuss your testimony

22 yesterday with anyone after you left the courthouse?

23 A. Yeah.

24 Q. Who did you discuss it with?

25 A. My wife.

26 Q. Anyone else?

27 A. No.

28 Q. Did you discuss it with any prosecutor? 4902



1 A. No, I was kind of nervous. I said, “How’d

2 it go?” And they smiled and they said, “It went

3 well.”

4 Q. And which prosecutor told you that?

5 A. I can’t specifically remember, but it was

6 one of them.

7 Q. Okay. Did you discuss anything else with

8 one of them?

9 A. No.

10 Q. Did you talk with any sheriff about your

11 testimony?

12 A. No.

13 Q. Were you on the phone last night with anyone

14 about your testimony?

15 A. No. I did tell my pastor this morning that

16 I was on the stand, and if he could pray for me.

17 But other than that, that was it.

18 Q. Anyone else?

19 A. Nope.

20 Q. Okay. Now, yesterday you told the jury that

21 Mr. Jackson had given you some money, correct?

22 A. Right.

23 Q. And you told them he had given you

24 hundred-dollar bills, right?

25 A. Right.

26 Q. Isn’t it true that when you were originally

27 interviewed by the police, you told them that Mr.

28 Jackson would give you money each time you read a 4903



1 book?

2 A. Yeah, he also said that, as well. Yeah,

3 he’d give me $20, I think it was.

4 Q. And you told the police that you remember

5 him having a room full of books, and you said every

6 time you complete a book, he’ll pay you some money,

7 right?

8 A. I don’t remember that, but I remember

9 listening to it on the tape.

10 Q. But that was your voice on the tape,

11 correct?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. Okay. You also told the police that Mr.

14 Jackson told you one time that if you got A’s in

15 school, he would also pay you every time you got an

16 A, correct?

17 A. Yes. That is correct. I remember -- I

18 don’t remember him saying that, but I remember it on

19 the tape.

20 Q. And that was your voice on the tape?

21 A. Yes, sir.

22 Q. Telling it to the police, correct?

23 A. Yes, sir.

24 Q. Okay. When you met with the prosecutors

25 before you testified, did anyone tell you not to

26 mention that when you talked about money?

27 A. No.

28 Q. Okay. You just forgot? 4904



1 A. I’m sorry?

2 Q. You just forgot yesterday?

3 MR. ZONEN: Objection; argumentative.

4 THE COURT: Overruled.

5 You may answer.

6 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: When you were responding

7 the prosecutor’s questions --

8 THE COURT: Wait. He has a question pending.

9 MR. MESEREAU: Oh, I’m sorry.

10 THE COURT: I overruled the objection.

11 THE WITNESS: Can you repeat the question?

12 THE COURT: The question was, “You just

13 forgot yesterday?”

14 THE WITNESS: I have no idea what you’re

15 referring to. I just forgot about what?

16 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: About Mr. Jackson paying

17 you money for, one, reading a book --

18 A. No --

19 Q. -- and, two, getting A’s.

20 A. I didn’t remember that, but I remember

21 saying that on the tape.

22 Q. Okay. Okay. Now, following your interview

23 with two police officers in November of 1993, to

24 your knowledge, Mr. Jackson was never charged with a

25 crime involving anything you said, correct?

26 A. I don’t know.

27 Q. Okay. Did you ever hear anything about

28 that? 4905



1 A. I -- no.

2 Q. Okay. To this day, you’re not sure if Mr.

3 Jackson was ever charged with any crime involving --

4 A. I don’t know.

5 Q. -- what you claim happened?

6 A. No.

7 Q. Okay. You also were interviewed a second

8 time.

9 A. There’s a hand being raised behind you guys

10 over there.

11 Q. You were interviewed a second time on March

12 24th, 1994. Do you remember that?

13 A. Again, I personally don’t remember, and I

14 didn’t even really listen to that tape, so -- and I

15 didn’t get a transcript for it either, so I didn’t

16 even review it.

17 Q. You were given a tape of your second

18 interview?

19 A. I was, but I did not listen to it.

20 Q. And who gave you that tape?

21 A. It came in the same packet as tape one and

22 with the transcript.

23 Q. Do you remember present at that interview

24 was Tom Sneddon?

25 A. I remember saying that yesterday, yeah. And

26 I also remember saying that I was unsure if he was

27 there or not.

28 Q. Okay. But you do remember now he was there, 4906



1 right?

2 A. I did not say that.

3 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I just

4 show you a transcript?

5 A. Sure.

6 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor?

7 THE COURT: Yes.

8 THE WITNESS: Is this a transcript of ‘94?

9 MR. MESEREAU: (Nods head up and down.)

10 THE WITNESS: So these are the people that

11 were there? I -- I can’t ask that.

12 THE COURT: He’s asking you to look at that

13 and see if that refreshes your memory to see --

14 THE WITNESS: No, it does not refresh my

15 memory.

16 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: So you don’t remember if

17 you were interviewed by Tom Sneddon and two district

18 attorneys in ‘94?

19 A. I remember Mike Craft being there. That was

20 the only person. And a woman being there. Other

21 than that, I cannot -- because I think that was the

22 first time I told a woman what happened.

23 Q. Do you remember someone named Lauren Weis

24 from the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office

25 being there --

26 A. I don’t. I’m really bad at names.

27 Q. I have to complete the question. Thank you.

28 Do you remember someone named Lauren Weis 4907



1 from the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office

2 being present at that interview?

3 A. No.

4 Q. Do you remember someone named Bill Hodgeman

5 from the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office

6 being at that interview?

7 A. No.

8 Q. And you don’t remember whether or not Mr.

9 Sneddon was there, right?

10 A. I -- correct.

11 Q. Are you saying he wasn’t there, or you just

12 don’t remember?

13 A. I don’t remember whether he was there or

14 not.

15 Q. Do you remember Russ Birchim being there?

16 A. I do not.

17 Q. Do you remember your own lawyer, Terry

18 Cannon, being there?

19 A. I do not.

20 Q. Do you remember stating in that interview,

21 “They made me come out with a lot more stuff I

22 didn’t want to say. They kept pushing. I wanted to

23 get up and hit them in the head”? Do you remember

24 that?

25 A. No.

26 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I show

27 you the transcript of that?

28 A. Probably not. But you can show it to me 4908



1 anyway.

2 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor?

3 THE COURT: Yes.

4 MR. ZONEN: What page, Counsel?

5 MR. MESEREAU: 30.

6 THE WITNESS: Okay.

7 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Have you had a chance to

8 look at that page of the transcript?

9 A. I have.

10 Q. Does it refresh your recollection about what

11 you’ve said?

12 A. No, it does not.

13 Q. Do you remember anything you said in that

14 interview at the moment?

15 A. Not really.

16 Q. Okay. All right. Do you remember in that

17 interview telling the people who were present that

18 at one point a woman came into a room where you and

19 Michael were present?

20 A. No, I do not.

21 Q. Do you remember seeing Janet Jackson on one

22 occasion?

23 A. I remember saying that, or do I remember

24 seeing her?

25 Q. Do you remember seeing her?

26 A. I think I did meet her once.

27 Q. Do you remember where you met her?

28 A. I think it was at the mansion in Encino. 4909



1 Q. Okay.

2 A. But I really -- like, I think that’s where

3 it was.

4 Q. Okay. Do you remember telling the sheriffs

5 that the first time you were tickled by Mr. Jackson

6 you think it lasted about 30 seconds?

7 A. Are we talking the first interview, second

8 interview?

9 Q. Either one.

10 A. I do not remember.

11 Q. Okay. You do remember giving more

12 information the second time, correct?

13 MR. ZONEN: “Second time?” Objection;

14 vague.

15 MR. MESEREAU: Excuse me. He’s correct.

16 I’ll withdraw it.

17 Q. You do recall giving more information during

18 your second interview than you did in your first,

19 right?

20 A. I do not recall.

21 Q. Okay. How did you meet Attorney Terry

22 Cannon?

23 A. I can’t -- I think I met them at Mike

24 Craft’s office.

25 Q. Excuse me, at whose office?

26 A. Mike Craft’s, my counselor.

27 Q. Okay. And does Terry Cannon still represent

28 you? 4910



1 A. I don’t think so, no.

2 Q. Well, you gave an interview with Mr. Zonen

3 in December of 2004, correct?

4 A. Yes. That was the first time I think I met

5 them.

6 Q. And Terry Cannon was present, correct?

7 A. You’re right.

8 Q. And Terry Cannon at that time was working

9 for the District Attorney’s Office in San Diego,

10 correct?

11 A. Correct.

12 Q. But he still came up to act like your

13 lawyer, didn’t he?

14 MR. ZONEN: I’ll object to the expression,

15 “act like your lawyer”; vague. Or argumentative.

16 THE COURT: Well, I guess instead of “like,”

17 it might be “as.”

18 MR. MESEREAU: I’ll rephrase it, Your Honor.

19 Q. Mr. Cannon was present at your interview

20 with Ron Zonen on December 6th, 2004, right?

21 A. Yes, sir.

22 Q. At that interview, he was serving as your

23 lawyer, correct?

24 A. I don’t know.

25 Q. Do you know why he was there?

26 A. I didn’t really know. I was asked by --

27 actually, I didn’t even know how I met you guys. I

28 was asked to be there, I think, and he was there. 4911



1 Q. Okay. Did he give you any legal advice

2 before that meeting?

3 A. Actually, he said, “You don’t have to answer

4 things if you don’t want to,” but I think that was

5 just a -- man advice.

6 Q. So he was giving legal advice?

7 A. I don’t know if that’s legal advice or not.

8 Q. Did he discuss with you what you were going

9 to say in that interview?

10 A. No.

11 Q. Do you remember when that interview began,

12 you requested that your interview not be

13 tape-recorded?

14 A. I don’t remember that.

15 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I show

16 you a report on that interview?

17 A. Okay. Sure.

18 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor?

19 THE COURT: Yes.

20 THE WITNESS: Okay.

21 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Have you had a chance to

22 look at that report?

23 A. I read the first paragraph.

24 Q. And does it refresh your recollection that

25 you requested that your interview not be

26 tape-recorded?

27 A. It does not, but I probably said that.

28 Q. Okay. You don’t know for sure, though? 4912



1 A. No.

2 Q. Okay. And you had requested that Mr. Cannon

3 be present at the interview, right?

4 A. You’re going to have to show me the paper

5 probably.

6 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor?

7 THE COURT: Yes.

8 THE WITNESS: (Nods head up and down.)

9 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Have you had a chance to

10 look at the report?

11 A. I did.

12 Q. Does it refresh your recollection that you

13 wanted Mr. Cannon present?

14 A. It does not refresh my recollection.

15 Q. Let me just try and get this straight. You

16 don’t know why Mr. Cannon was there, correct?

17 A. Correct.

18 Q. You didn’t ask him to be there, right?

19 A. I don’t remember whether I asked for him to

20 be there or not. I probably did, only because he

21 was a friend of mine and he knows more legal stuff

22 than I do.

23 Q. Okay. Did you know he was working for a

24 District Attorney’s Office at the time?

25 A. I believe I did, because we kept in touch --

26 Q. Okay.

27 A. -- after I was 18.

28 Q. All right. Now, Mr. Zonen began that 4913



1 interview by telling you about the current case

2 involving Mr. Jackson, right?

3 A. I didn’t understand the question.

4 Q. Well, let me try and rephrase it.

5 A. Okay.

6 Q. At the beginning of that interview, Mr.

7 Zonen gave you his summary of the current case

8 against Mr. Jackson, right?

9 A. I believe so.

10 Q. And he told you about a family named

11 “Arvizo,” right?

12 A. Really bad at names. If that’s -- he told

13 me about a child molestation.

14 Q. Okay. That these were the charges against

15 Mr. Jackson, right?

16 A. I believe so.

17 Q. Okay. Have you ever met Janet Arvizo?

18 A. I don’t know who that is.

19 Q. Ever met David Arvizo?

20 A. I don’t know who that is.

21 Q. Ever met Gavin Arvizo?

22 A. Oh, that -- I do know who that is. No, I

23 have not met him.

24 Q. Have you ever met Star Arvizo?

25 A. I have never met an Arvizo I don’t think.

26 Q. Never met Davellin Arvizo, correct?

27 A. Right.

28 Q. Have you ever talked to any of the Arvizo 4914



1 family on the telephone?

2 A. No.

3 Q. Okay. But Mr. Zonen was telling you about

4 the Arvizo family, was he not?

5 A. If that’s the child’s parents, then yes.

6 Q. Incidentally, after your second interview,

7 which you don’t remember a lot about, to your

8 knowledge, no criminal charges were ever filed

9 against Mr. Jackson involving anything you had told

10 anybody, right?

11 A. I don’t know.

12 Q. You still don’t know?

13 A. I -- are you talking about ‘94, the ‘94

14 interview?

15 Q. Yes.

16 A. Okay. And you’re asking if there was

17 criminal charges pressed against Michael?

18 Q. I’m asking you what you know, okay? You’ve

19 already indicated that after your ‘93 interview, no

20 criminal charges were ever filed against Mr. Jackson

21 involving anything you said, right?

22 A. I don’t know much. I don’t watch the news.

23 Q. And -- okay. And after your ‘94 interview,

24 again, no criminal charges were ever filed against

25 Mr. Jackson involving anything you said, right?

26 A. I don’t know.

27 Q. Okay. But at your ‘94 interview, you do

28 remember Terry Cannon being present, right? 4915



1 A. I don’t know. I don’t know who was present

2 other than Michael Craft in ‘94.

3 Q. Okay. To your knowledge, was it your mom’s

4 idea for you to have an attorney at that meeting?

5 A. To my knowledge, I don’t know.

6 Q. Okay. And again, just for the record, how

7 old were you --

8 MR. ZONEN: I’ll object as vague as to which

9 meeting.

10 MR. MESEREAU: He’s correct. I’ll withdraw

11 it.

12 THE COURT: All right.

13 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: To your knowledge, was it

14 your mother’s idea to have an attorney be present at

15 the March 24th, 1994, interview?

16 A. To my knowledge, I have no clue.

17 Q. Okay.

18 A. When I was 13, I was really protected by my

19 mom, so I didn’t know much --

20 Q. Okay.

21 A. -- about anything.

22 Q. And certainly when you were 13, you didn’t

23 hire an attorney, someone else did, right?

24 A. I didn’t -- probably.

25 Q. Okay. Okay. Do you remember meeting with

26 Attorney Terry Cannon, with your mother, in 1994?

27 A. I do not remember, but I’m sure we did.

28 Q. Okay. All right. Do you remember meeting 4916



1 with any other attorneys that your mother had

2 retained in 1994?

3 A. Other than Terry Cannon?

4 Q. Yes.

5 A. I don’t remember. But there was another

6 attorney, which is Kris Kallman.

7 Q. Okay. And Kris Kallman is the attorney who

8 represented you in a settlement with Mr. Jackson,

9 right?

10 A. I don’t know whether it was Kris or Terry.

11 Q. And Kris also represented your mother, who

12 wanted a settlement with Mr. Jackson, correct?

13 A. I don’t know.

14 Q. Now, do you know whether or not your mother

15 went to these attorneys after she learned that Mr.

16 Jackson had settled with someone named Chandler?

17 A. I do not.

18 MR. ZONEN: Objection; lack of foundation.

19 THE COURT: Court reporter, was that an

20 answer on there?

21 THE REPORTER: Yes.

22 THE COURT: I’ll overrule the objection. The

23 answer was, “I do not.”

24 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Why didn’t you want your

25 interview in December of 2004 with the prosecutors

26 tape-recorded?

27 A. I don’t know.

28 Q. You don’t have any idea why you made that 4917



1 request?

2 A. Tape-recording is weird. I don’t know. No,

3 I don’t.

4 Q. Okay. Do you remember telling Prosecutor

5 Zonen in the December 2004 interview regarding the

6 first incident you described - okay? - that you and

7 Mr. Jackson were in a tickle contest? Do you

8 remember that?

9 A. I do not. I don’t know whether it was the

10 first interview or the second interview that we

11 talked about Michael molesting me.

12 Q. Well, actually, in the December interview,

13 you told Prosecutor Zonen that, in all three

14 instances that you described where you claim you

15 were inappropriately touched, every incident was

16 preceded by a tickling contest between you and Mr.

17 Jackson, right?

18 A. I don’t know.

19 Q. Would it refresh your recollection just to

20 show you the report?

21 A. You can show it to me, but I don’t know

22 whether it was the first or the second.

23 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor?

24 THE COURT: Yes.

25 THE WITNESS: Okay.

26 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Have you had a chance to

27 review that page of the report?

28 A. I didn’t read the whole page. I read that 4918



1 paragraph.

2 Q. Does it refresh your recollection about what

3 you told Prosecutor Zonen in that December 6th,

4 2004, interview?

5 A. It doesn’t -- I don’t -- it doesn’t help

6 remembering, but --

7 Q. Well, you told him that all three events

8 that you described were preceded by a tickling

9 contest, correct?

10 A. I don’t remember.

11 Q. You and Mr. Jackson were in a contest as to

12 who could tickle the most, correct?

13 A. I just said I don’t remember that. I don’t

14 mean to sound like I’m wasting your time, but this

15 is kind of hard being up here, and --

16 Q. No, please don’t. Just respond to my

17 questions, if you would, please.

18 A. Okay. Sorry.

19 Q. Now, on November 19th, 2004, Prosecutor

20 Zonen and Auchincloss interviewed your mother at the

21 District Attorney’s Office, right?

22 A. I don’t know. Me and my mother don’t talk

23 about that stuff much.

24 Q. Well, you were present, weren’t you?

25 A. Now I remember, yes.

26 Q. Now you remember?

27 A. Yeah. I was present there.

28 Q. You not only were present, but you also 4919



1 requested that that not be tape-recorded, correct?

2 A. Probably.

3 Q. You don’t know?

4 A. I don’t know.

5 Q. Would it refresh your recollection to look

6 at that report?

7 A. No. But bring it on up.

8 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor?

9 THE COURT: No, he said it wouldn’t.

10 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: You’re not willing to look

11 at it?

12 A. It’s not about me willing. I’m willing to

13 look at it, but it’s not going to help.

14 Q. Well, that was last November you had that

15 interview with your mom and these prosecutors,

16 correct?

17 A. Again, this is all difficult.

18 Q. I know it’s difficult, but you’re saying you

19 don’t remember that interview?

20 A. You just said I met with my mom and I was

21 there, and I didn’t remember until you said that,

22 and then I remembered.

23 Q. Do you remember you and your mom both

24 requested that the interview not be tape-recorded?

25 A. I do not.

26 Q. Would it refresh your recollection to see

27 what it says in the report about that?

28 A. Bring it over. It -- yeah. Bring it over. 4920



1 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor?

2 THE COURT: Yes.

3 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Have you had a chance to

4 look at the page of that report?

5 A. Yeah, I read the first paragraph.

6 Q. Does it refresh your recollection about you

7 and your mother both requesting no tape-recording?

8 A. No, it does not.

9 Q. Okay. You don’t remember one way or the

10 other about that?

11 A. Right.

12 Q. Okay. Okay. Now, on that particular day,

13 and I’m referring to November 19th, 2004, you were

14 interviewed as well, correct?

15 A. Was this when my mother was present?

16 Q. Yes.

17 A. Okay.

18 Q. Do you remember you were interviewed on that

19 day?

20 A. I think I was just there for my mom.

21 Q. Well, actually, they interviewed your mom

22 first and then they interviewed you second, correct?

23 A. I don’t remember that.

24 Q. Okay. They interviewed you for about an

25 hour, didn’t they?

26 A. They may have.

27 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I show

28 you the report about that? 4921



1 A. No.

2 Q. You’re not willing to look at it?

3 A. I’ll look at it. I’ll look at it, but no,

4 it probably won’t.

5 Q. You don’t remember an hour interview on

6 November 19th, 2004?

7 A. Again, the issue is it’s all kind of

8 blending in together.

9 Q. You do remember the December interview with

10 Prosecutor Zonen, right?

11 A. You asked me that --

12 Q. Yes.

13 A. Go ahead, ask it again. Do I remember the

14 December interview?

15 Q. Yes.

16 A. I remember it taking place. I don’t

17 remember what specific was asked.

18 Q. Actually, let me clarify the date.

19 A. Okay.

20 Q. Okay. I’m talking about the report. You

21 were interviewed on October 18th, 2004, by

22 prosecutors, right?

23 A. I’m sorry?

24 Q. You were interviewed on October 18th by

25 prosecutors, correct?

26 A. Of 2004?

27 Q. Yes.

28 A. I believe that was the first time that I met 4922



1 these guys, but I don’t know.

2 Q. And then you were interviewed approximately

3 a month later on November 19th, right?

4 A. You got a bunch of hands raised behind you.

5 THE BAILIFF: Mr. Mesereau, could you check

6 if it’s on? I guess they can’t hear you back there.

7 THE WITNESS: Sorry, that’s what was kind of

8 distracting me.

9 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: I had mentioned a December

10 date. Actually, you were interviewed in October and

11 November of 2004, right?

12 A. October, November, December. I don’t know.

13 Q. Okay. Do you remember having Terry

14 Cannon --

15 A. They’re raising their hands again.

16 THE COURT: Quit hitting my microphone.

17 MR. MESEREAU: Oh. Okay.

18 THE COURT: Beat the poor thing -- you know,

19 what’s happening, you have a book that’s hitting the

20 “off” button. I can see from here that you can’t

21 see, maybe.

22 MR. MESEREAU: I think it’s on, but --

23 THE COURT: Gently.

24 THE WITNESS: Yeah, it’s bad to hit mikes.

25 THE BAILIFF: Actually, it’s -- when you

26 step back and are at a far distance, it’s hard to

27 hear.

28 MR. MESEREAU: Okay. 4923



1 Q. In your interview with the prosecutors on

2 October 18th --

3 A. This is the first one?

4 Q. Well, first we have ‘93. Then we have ‘94.

5 A. Okay.

6 Q. Then we have October of 2004, and then

7 November of 2004. Okay?

8 A. Okay.

9 Q. In your interview in October of 2004, you

10 were asked about the third incident where you claim

11 Mr. Jackson tickled your testicles, right?

12 A. I was probably asked that, yes.

13 Q. Do you remember you told the prosecutors it

14 lasted for more than ten seconds, but you don’t know

15 how much longer after that?

16 A. I don’t remember saying that.

17 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I

18 showed you your report?

19 A. My report? No, it wouldn’t.

20 Q. Well, the police reports.

21 A. The police report. I’ll look at it, but

22 it’s probably not going to help.

23 Q. Are you willing to give it a chance?

24 A. Yeah.

25 Q. Think it might help?

26 A. No. I’m sorry. But you can -- I’ll give it

27 a shot.

28 MR. MESEREAU: Okay. May I approach, Your 4924



1 Honor?

2 THE COURT: Yes.

3 THE WITNESS: Okay.

4 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Have you had a chance to

5 look at the page of that report?

6 A. I have.

7 Q. Does it refresh your recollection that you

8 told the prosecutors it lasted more than ten

9 seconds?

10 A. It does not help me remember.

11 Q. Don’t remember that at all?

12 A. No, but I could probably agree with it if it

13 was in the report.

14 Q. Okay. Before either the October interview

15 or the November interview with prosecutors, did you

16 discuss what you were going to say in any of those

17 interviews with your mother?

18 A. No.

19 Q. You would agree that Attorney Terry Cannon

20 was present at both the October interview, 2004, and

21 the November interview, 2004, right?

22 A. I can’t remember whether he was there on the

23 November one with me and my mom.

24 Q. Did you discuss what you were going to say

25 at either interview in advance with Attorney Terry

26 Cannon?

27 A. I don’t think so.

28 Q. How did he end up showing up for any of 4925



1 those interviews, if you know?

2 A. I think he called me and said I might be

3 subpoenaed for this. I can’t -- I think Kris called

4 me and said I might be subpoenaed up here.

5 Q. Correct me if I’m wrong, I think you said

6 yesterday that you never knew that your mother had

7 gotten $20,000 from the television show Hard Copy to

8 give an interview.

9 A. I think you’re wrong.

10 Q. Okay. Did you know that before you

11 testified yesterday?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. And when did you first learn that your

14 mother got $20,000 to give an interview with Hard

15 Copy in the early ‘90s?

16 A. I think it was last Sunday.

17 Q. Okay. And I guess she told you that?

18 A. No.

19 Q. She’s never told you that?

20 A. That she received $20,000? She has never

21 told me that.

22 Q. Did you know before last week that your

23 mother had been paid to go on the television show

24 Hard Copy?

25 A. I think I assumed it.

26 Q. Okay. But you didn’t know for sure?

27 A. I didn’t know for sure.

28 Q. Never discussed it with her? 4926



1 A. I don’t think I did, no.

2 Q. Okay. All right. Now, you admitted that at

3 the beginning of your first interview with sheriffs

4 in ‘93, you said that Mr. Jackson had not touched

5 your genital area, right?

6 A. I said that at the very beginning.

7 MR. ZONEN: Objection; asked and answered.

8 THE COURT: Sustained.

9 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: It was only after you were

10 pushed real hard by the sheriffs that you began to

11 say anything like that, true?

12 MR. ZONEN: Objection; asked and answered.

13 THE COURT: Sustained.

14 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: And at one point a sheriff

15 actually used a curse word to get you to say

16 something, correct?

17 A. I don’t remember that, but you could show me

18 the thing.

19 Q. Okay. But as you sit here today, you don’t

20 remember, right?

21 A. I don’t remember the four-letter word.

22 Everybody in junior high cussed.

23 Q. How about the word “bullshit”?

24 A. What about it?

25 Q. Do you remember a sheriff telling you that?

26 A. I don’t, but I think I remember listening to

27 it on the tape.

28 Q. Do you remember in that interview one 4927



1 sheriff telling you, “Mr. Jackson is a molester,”

2 and the other saying, “He makes great music, he’s a

3 great guy, bullshit”? Do you remember that?

4 A. I don’t remember that specifically, but I

5 think I remember hearing it on the tape, which was

6 my voice, or his voice.

7 Q. You do remember a sheriff’s voice saying

8 that, right?

9 A. I don’t remember right now of ‘93, but I

10 remember listening to the tape.

11 Q. Okay. And a sheriff said that to you,

12 correct?

13 A. I believe so.

14 Q. And the sheriffs complained that, “Mr.

15 Jackson has a lot of money” in that interview,

16 right?

17 A. I believe he did say that, but can I look at

18 the paper?

19 Q. Sure.

20 May I approach, Your Honor?

21 THE COURT: Yes.

22 THE WITNESS: Okay.

23 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Have you had a chance to

24 look at the transcript?

25 A. I did.

26 Q. Does it refresh your recollection about what

27 the sheriffs said to you about Mr. Jackson in the

28 interview? 4928



1 A. I don’t remember that specifically, but

2 reading it in the transcript, I remember reading

3 that in the transcript when I read it on Sunday,

4 when I reviewed the tape.

5 Q. And even after sheriffs said to you, “He’s a

6 molester, he’s a great guy, makes great music,

7 bullshit, he has lots of money,” you still said he

8 had never touched your genital area, right?

9 A. I believe so. Probably towards the

10 beginning again.

11 Q. Do you remember the sheriff interviewing you

12 wanted to know whether Mr. Jackson went under your

13 pants or on top of your underwear, and you said, “I

14 don’t know”?

15 A. I’m sorry?

16 Q. Do you remember the interviewing sheriff

17 asked you, “Have you ever been touched under your

18 pants or on top of your underwear?” And you said,

19 “I don’t know”?

20 A. Were we talking about a specific incident?

21 Q. I’m just asking about the interview.

22 A. Oh. Then --

23 MR. ZONEN: I’ll object as vague, Your

24 Honor.

25 THE COURT: Sustained.

26 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Do you remember in that

27 interview, when you first said in response to the

28 sheriffs questions, “Mr. Jackson touched me,” you 4929



1 had no idea how long he had ever touched you?

2 MR. ZONEN: Objection; vague. Which

3 incident?

4 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: During any incident?

5 THE COURT: Do you want to rephrase the whole

6 question?

7 MR. MESEREAU: Sure.

8 Q. Do you remember in your first interview with

9 the sheriffs when, after repeated questioning, you

10 finally said, “Mr. Jackson touched me,” do you

11 remember not knowing how long he had ever touched

12 you at any time?

13 A. I don’t remember.

14 Q. Okay. Do you remember telling the sheriffs

15 that Mr. Jackson, during your tickle games, used to

16 pinch you in the stomach?

17 A. Tickling, pinching. Same thing.

18 Q. Okay. You did tell the sheriffs in your

19 first interview you had never spent the night with

20 Mr. Jackson, right?

21 A. I never slept in his bed with him.

22 Q. Okay. When did you last talk to Attorney

23 Terry Cannon?

24 A. Yesterday.

25 Q. Did you talk about your testimony?

26 A. No.

27 Q. Did you talk about the case?

28 A. Nope. 4930



1 Q. Did he call you --

2 A. Wait, actually, I’m sorry, I didn’t talk

3 about the case, but I talked about I was being

4 nervous up here.

5 Q. Did you call him or did he call you?

6 A. He called me.

7 Q. When did you last talk to Attorney Terry

8 Cannon before yesterday?

9 A. Um -- um, um, um, um. I really cannot

10 remember the specific date.

11 Q. Now, in your interview of March 24th, 1994,

12 you didn’t remember what cartoons you were watching

13 when you claim you were improperly touched, right?

14 A. I don’t know.

15 Q. Did you know you were being tape-recorded in

16 that interview?

17 A. You know what? I don’t know. Typically I’d

18 remember that.

19 Q. And do you remember telling the interviewers

20 that Michael Jackson tickled you in your stomach?

21 A. No.

22 Q. You don’t remember that?

23 A. No. Can I review that?

24 Q. Sure.

25 A. Is that -- it was being taped then? Or you

26 can’t say. Okay, yeah.

27 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor?

28 THE COURT: Yes. 4931



1 MR. ZONEN: What page, Counsel?

2 MR. MESEREAU: 58.

3 THE WITNESS: Okay.

4 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: You remember telling the

5 people interviewing you that Mr. Jackson did tickle

6 you in your stomach, right?

7 A. I do not remember saying that, but I

8 probably said that.

9 Q. Okay. Do you remember in that interview

10 when you finally said Mr. Jackson had touched your

11 penis, that you told the interviewers, “He tickled

12 me there”? Right?

13 A. I don’t know.

14 Q. Do you remember you were asked, “What did he

15 do with his hands?” And you said, “He tickled me.”

16 Do you remember that?

17 A. “What did he do with his hands?” And I

18 said, “He tickled me”?

19 Q. Yes.

20 A. That’s kind of vague. Like overall he

21 tickled me, or what are you talking about?

22 Q. You were asked what Mr. Jackson did with

23 your penis. Do you remember that? And you said,

24 “He tickled me.” Do you remember that?

25 A. He did tickle me.

26 Q. Okay. You were asked to describe what Mr.

27 Jackson did with his hands, and your response was,

28 “He tickled me,” true? 4932



1 A. I don’t know. I was probably crying then.

2 Q. Would you like to review the transcript, see

3 if it refreshes your recollection?

4 A. Sure.

5 MR. MESEREAU: Okay. May I approach, Your

6 Honor?

7 THE COURT: Yes.

8 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: By the way, if you don’t

9 remember the interview, how do you know you were

10 crying?

11 A. Because I usually cry when we’re talking

12 about the molestation.

13 Q. Okay. Okay. Again, do you remember saying

14 to the police officers in response to their

15 question, “What did he do with your penis?” You

16 said, “He tickled me”?

17 A. I thought you were going to bring me that

18 thing.

19 Q. Would you like to see it?

20 A. Yes.

21 Q. Okay.

22 A. Okay.

23 Q. Do you remember describing what Mr. Jackson

24 did as tickling?

25 A. Do I remember describing what Michael

26 Jackson did as tickling?

27 Q. Yes.

28 A. Like tickling my penis or -- 4933



1 Q. Yes.

2 A. Are we talking the first or second or third

3 incident?

4 Q. I don’t know.

5 MR. ZONEN: Well, I’m going to object as

6 vague.

7 THE COURT: The objection is sustained.

8 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Do you remember telling

9 the interviewers in that second interview in 1994,

10 when they asked you what Mr. Jackson did with your

11 penis, you said, “He didn’t really touch it, he was

12 above my shorts”? Do you remember that?

13 A. Are we talking first or second or third?

14 Q. I believe you were just answering their

15 questions.

16 MR. ZONEN: Objection; vague.

17 THE COURT: Sustained.

18 Counsel, you’re going to have to direct --

19 if you’re going to question in this manner, you’re

20 going to have to direct it to specific times. There

21 were three interviews.

22 MR. MESEREAU: Okay. I’m sorry, Your Honor.

23 THE COURT: And you’re being unfair to the

24 witness in my opinion.

25 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Okay. Directing you to

26 the second interview that you ever gave about these

27 events, okay? And that was the interview --

28 A. In ‘94? 4934



1 Q. Yes.

2 A. Okay.

3 Q. Yes. Okay?

4 A. I thought we were talking about 2004. I’m

5 sorry.

6 Q. Okay. That’s my mistake, I apologize.

7 Let’s talk about the 1994 interview.

8 A. Okay.

9 Q. All right? Do you remember being asked the

10 question, “Did Mr. Jackson touch your penis?” And

11 you said, “He didn’t really touch it, he was above

12 my shorts”?

13 A. I do not --

14 THE COURT: Wait. Just a minute.

15 THE WITNESS: I’m sorry.

16 THE COURT: I want you to approach.

17 MR. MESEREAU: Sure.

18 (Discussion held off the record at sidebar.)

19 THE COURT: All right. You may proceed.

20 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Okay. I’m going to try

21 and direct my questions to a particular interview,

22 one of the four that you had, and direct them to one

23 of the three events that you have described when you

24 claim Mr. Jackson improperly touched you, okay?

25 Now, directing your attention to the second

26 interview, which is in 1994 - okay? - and directing

27 your attention to the first event that you have

28 described where you claim Mr. Jackson improperly 4935



1 touched you - okay? - do you remember -- excuse me.

2 Isn’t it true that, when asked about the first event

3 in that second interview, you said Mr. Jackson

4 didn’t really touch your penis?

5 A. I don’t --

6 MR. ZONEN: What page?

7 MR. MESEREAU: 60.

8 THE WITNESS: No, I don’t remember.

9 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Would it refresh your

10 recollection if I show you a page of that

11 transcript?

12 A. Bring it over.

13 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach?

14 THE COURT: Yes.

15 THE WITNESS: Okay.

16 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Have you had a chance to

17 look at that page?

18 A. I have. Well, not the tape. I’ve read

19 those two little sentences there.

20 Q. Does it refresh your recollection of what

21 you told the people who were interviewing you about

22 that first event during the interview in 1994?

23 A. It does not refresh my memory. But in

24 reading it --

25 THE COURT: Wait. That’s the end of your

26 answer.

27 THE WITNESS: Okay. Sorry.

28 THE COURT: Listen to the question and just 4936



1 answer the question asked.

2 THE WITNESS: Okay.

3 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: You just don’t recall

4 saying that, right?

5 A. Correct.

6 Q. Could you please describe, to the extent you

7 remember, the sleeping bag in the apartment that you

8 called the hideout?

9 A. Describe the bag itself?

10 Q. Yes. If you remember. How big it was,

11 where it was, et cetera.

12 A. Near a window. If you’re looking at the

13 T.V., to the right of the T.V.

14 Q. And there was no furniture in the apartment

15 that you remember?

16 A. I did not say that.

17 Q. Okay. What did you say?

18 A. I said that there was an L-shaped couch in

19 the hideout somewhere, in the living room, I

20 believe.

21 Q. Okay. And at any time when you claim you

22 were improperly touched, were you sitting on the

23 couch?

24 A. No, I never said that either.

25 Q. During the events that you’ve described at

26 the hideout --

27 A. Okay.

28 Q. -- where you say you were improperly 4937



1 tickled - okay? --

2 A. Okay.

3 Q. -- were you always on top of the sleeping

4 bag?

5 A. No. The first time I was on a chair.

6 Q. Okay. The second time you were on a

7 sleeping bag, right?

8 A. Correct.

9 Q. Okay. Did both of those instances start out

10 as tickle contests?

11 A. Yeah.

12 Q. Okay. And in both of those incidences that

13 you’ve described, you recall it starting out as

14 innocent sort of tickling and leading to an improper

15 touching, right?

16 A. Right.

17 Q. Okay. Now, you’ve admitted that Mr. Jackson

18 said he would pay you money for completing a book

19 and also for getting A’s in school, right?

20 A. I remember hearing that on the tape.

21 Q. Do you recall Mr. Jackson saying that to

22 you?

23 MR. ZONEN: Objection; asked and answered.

24 THE COURT: Sustained.

25 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Do you recall being paid

26 for reading a book?

27 A. I wasn’t a reader.

28 Q. Did you ever tell Mr. Jackson, if you 4938



1 remember, “I’ve completed a book”?

2 A. If I did, I don’t know.

3 Q. Okay. Do you remember telling Mr. Jackson

4 you got A’s in school?

5 A. If I did get an A, it was probably in P.E.

6 Q. And do you remember telling that to Mr.

7 Jackson?

8 A. I don’t think I ever did. I don’t know.

9 Q. Okay. Now, without going into any amounts,

10 when did you ever receive any money?

11 A. From Michael?

12 Q. From a settlement --

13 A. Oh.

14 Q. -- in your case.

15 A. From the settlement?

16 Q. Without going into any amounts, just when

17 did you first receive any money?

18 A. When I turned 18.

19 Q. Okay. Without going into any amounts, do

20 you know if your mother has received any money from

21 Mr. Jackson?

22 A. She has.

23 Q. Do you know approximately when she received

24 money from a settlement?

25 A. I don’t.

26 Q. Okay. Do you know if it was before you did?

27 A. I think it was.

28 Q. Okay. Have you ever been approached by 4939



1 anyone in the media who wanted to talk to you about

2 anything involving Mr. Jackson?

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. And when did that happen?

5 A. Geez. When I was in junior high; when I

6 was -- shoot, in ‘93 -- in ‘93, ‘94 I think.

7 Recently. Well, actually, not recently. A couple

8 years ago. They -- yeah, the media.

9 Q. Do you know how the media ever heard about

10 you?

11 A. I don’t.

12 Q. Okay.

13 A. Actually, I talked to a media guy once.

14 Q. Who was that?

15 A. I don’t remember. He had a British accent.

16 But I did not say anything about the case, or

17 anything about Michael. What --

18 Q. And when did this happen?

19 MR. ZONEN: I’m not sure the witness had

20 completed his answer.

21 MR. MESEREAU: Oh, I’m sorry, I thought he

22 had.

23 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Were you finished?

24 A. No, I wasn’t.

25 Q. My mistake.

26 THE COURT: Let’s just stop. There wasn’t

27 any question pending. He was in a narrative for

28 some reason. Next question. 4940



1 THE WITNESS: Okay.

2 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Do you know approximately

3 when you spoke to a representative of the media?

4 A. I don’t. I know I was late to class, but I

5 don’t. I was in -- probably ‘92 or ‘93.

6 Q. How about in recent -- the last couple

7 years, anyone approach you, to your knowledge?

8 A. Well, to my knowledge, no. They tried to,

9 but I somehow always evade them. Not on purpose.

10 It just happens.

11 Q. In your second interview in 1994, you were

12 asked, “Did you ever have any discussion with

13 Michael Jackson about whether you should tell

14 anybody about the things you described?” Remember

15 that?

16 A. (Shakes head from side to side.)

17 Q. You don’t? Okay.

18 A. No, I don’t.

19 Q. Okay. Do you remember telling the

20 interviewers, when you were asked do you remember

21 anything that he said, you said, “No, I’m working on

22 that”?

23 A. No.

24 MR. ZONEN: I’ll object as to which

25 interview; vague.

26 MR. MESEREAU: In the second interview, I’m

27 sorry.

28 Q. In the second interview -- let me rephrase 4941



1 the question. I’ll withdraw it.

2 In the second interview in 1994 - okay? --

3 A. Okay.

4 Q. -- that was recorded - all right? - when

5 asked if Mr. Jackson said anything to you about

6 whether you should discuss what happened, do you

7 remember telling the interviewers, “No, but I’m

8 working on that”?

9 A. I do not remember that.

10 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I show

11 you the transcript?

12 A. No. But -- you could bring it over.

13 Q. Well, I can’t unless you’re willing to see

14 if it refreshes your recollection.

15 A. Okay. Bring it over. I’ll give it a shot.

16 I’ll read it just to see if it refreshes my memory.

17 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach?

18 THE COURT: Yes.

19 MR. ZONEN: Page, Counsel?

20 MR. MESEREAU: Yes. Pages 105, 106.

21 THE WITNESS: Okay.

22 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Have you had a chance to

23 review those pages --

24 A. I have.

25 Q. -- of your transcript?

26 Do they refresh your recollection about what

27 you said on that subject?

28 A. No, it does not. 4942



1 Q. It doesn’t.

2 A. Sorry.

3 Q. Now, in that interview you indicated that

4 you were aware that another boy had sued Mr. Jackson

5 seeking money, right?

6 MR. ZONEN: I’m sorry, which interview?

7 Objection.

8 MR. MESEREAU: I’m sorry, the second -- let

9 me rephrase it.

10 Q. In the second interview that you gave in

11 1994 - okay? --

12 A. Okay.

13 Q. -- you indicated that you were aware that

14 someone else had sued Mr. Jackson for money,

15 correct?

16 A. I don’t remember.

17 Q. Would it refresh your recollection to look

18 at the transcript?

19 A. Probably not.

20 Q. Okay.

21 A. Both of them are really blurry. It was just

22 hard for me at the time.

23 Q. Well, let me ask you this.

24 A. Okay.

25 Q. Looking back, when is the first time you

26 recall you knew someone else had sued Mr. Jackson

27 looking for money?

28 A. Probably 16. 4943



1 Q. Excuse me?

2 A. I was probably 16. Because that’s when

3 money started being an issue for me.

4 Q. Okay. Now, in your last interview with

5 Prosecutor Zonen - and I’m talking about an

6 interview on November 19th, 2004, okay? - Mr. Cannon

7 was present, right?

8 A. I don’t know.

9 Q. Do you recall Mr. Cannon not wanting a

10 defense investigator present?

11 A. No, I don’t recall.

12 Q. Did you know anything about that?

13 A. No.

14 MR. MESEREAU: Okay. At this time, I have

15 no further questions, Your Honor.

16 THE COURT: All right. Redirect?

17

18 REDIRECT EXAMINATION

19 BY MR. ZONEN:

20 Q. Mr. Francia, did you get any money from Mr.

21 Jackson for reading a book?

22 A. I don’t think so.

23 Q. Did you ever get any money from Mr. Jackson

24 for getting A’s?

25 A. I don’t think so.

26 Q. Were grades a problem for you when you were

27 in school about that time?

28 A. Shoot, through all my whole life, grades 4944



1 were a problem.

2 Q. Did you -- do you sometimes have difficulty

3 with reading?

4 A. Yeah.

5 Q. At this time even?

6 A. Yeah.

7 Q. All right. A lot of questions were asked of

8 you by Mr. Mesereau that dealt with that first

9 interview that took place in 1993, the first time

10 that there was a disclosure. And you indicated, I

11 believe, that what you said toward the end of the

12 interview was very different than what you said at

13 the beginning of the interview. Would you explain

14 that for us, please? Why is that?

15 A. Why there was a difference in the beginning

16 and --

17 Q. Yes.

18 A. Because in the beginning, I thought I could

19 hold them off and make them go away. And they

20 didn’t go away. At all. It’s kind of an issue when

21 I was 13. I didn’t want to tell anybody that I’d

22 been molested; that I didn’t want to tell anybody

23 that anything ever happened to me. That’s weird.

24 Q. Why?

25 A. Because you’re 13. That’s weird.

26 Q. What were the issues that you were dealing

27 with at that time about that?

28 A. In fifth grade, I told my friends that I 4945



1 knew Michael Jackson, and I thought it was cool. My

2 friends thought it was cool. They didn’t believe

3 me. But they thought it was cool.

4 In junior high, it’s no longer cool to know

5 somebody that had issues with kids, because then

6 they’re going to make fun of you.

7 And even at the church, they made fun of me.

8 At the church, worse than school, they made fun of

9 me.

10 Q. And you were actually teased?

11 A. Yeah.

12 Q. You said yesterday to one of Mr. Mesereau’s

13 questions that you told the detective, “No, I’m not

14 gay.” Did you make that statement to them?

15 A. I remember listening to it in the tape. I

16 don’t recall saying that. But I remember listening

17 to it on the tape.

18 Q. Do you recall whether or not that was an

19 issue for you during the course of that interview,

20 that that was one of your concerns, that people

21 would see you as that?

22 A. Yes. That was a concern of mine.

23 Q. You mentioned yesterday to one of Mr.

24 Mesereau’s questions that the defendant put the

25 money down your pants. Would you describe that for

26 us?

27 A. What do you want to know?

28 Q. Where did the money go? In other words, 4946



1 when he -- when he gave you money, did he hand it to

2 you, or did he do something else? And if so, tell

3 us what that is.

4 A. He put the money in my shorts, because I

5 pulled it out, and that’s when my mom saw -- noticed

6 that I had pulled money out of my shorts and she

7 asked me where I got it from.

8 Q. Do you remember which of the three occasions

9 this was?

10 A. I can’t remember whether it was the first or

11 the second.

12 Q. But this was back when you were young?

13 A. Yeah.

14 Q. Seven or eight?

15 A. Seven or eight.

16 Q. You say in your shorts. What are we talking

17 about? In a pocket?

18 A. I don’t think my mom put pockets on the

19 shorts.

20 Q. That was a little more complicated?

21 A. She’s a good seamstress, but I don’t think

22 for shorts.

23 Q. Tell us as best you can recall where would

24 that money have been.

25 A. That would have been in my shorts.

26 Q. I’m sorry?

27 A. It would have been in my shorts.

28 Q. In the inside? 4947



1 A. In the inside.

2 Q. Do you know if the money was in your

3 underwear?

4 A. I don’t. I don’t know.

5 Q. Mr. Mesereau asked you yesterday questions

6 about whether you talked to your mother about what

7 had happened, and if so, to what extent.

8 Did you ever have a conversation with your

9 mother where you told her that you were molested?

10 A. I think I told her that I was molested in

11 counseling, because then she shared that she was

12 molested as well.

13 Q. Okay. Did you ever tell her the details of

14 the molestation?

15 A. No.

16 Q. What had happened, how it happened, how

17 often it happened, any of those types of details?

18 A. I don’t think so.

19 Q. To this day, have you ever?

20 A. To this day. My wife found out on the

21 stand.

22 Q. The details you had not yet told your wife?

23 A. Right.

24 Q. Have you ever told anybody the details other

25 than your therapist?

26 A. My pastor.

27 Q. Your pastor?

28 A. And I don’t think I told him the details. 4948



1 MR. ZONEN: Thank you. I have no further

2 questions.

3 THE COURT: Recross?

4 MR. MESEREAU: No further questions, Your

5 Honor.

6 THE COURT: All right. You may step down.

7 He needs to move away.

21 A. He and his mother, yes.

22 Q. And can you tell us, did you ever prepare a

23 lawsuit on behalf of Jason Francia?

24 A. We prepared a Complaint, which is a document

25 that’s the beginning of a lawsuit, yes.

26 Q. And when you say “we,” who’s “we”?

27 A. Mr. Cannon and myself.

28 Q. So Mr. Cannon was working with you on that 4952



1 particular case?

2 A. Yes, sir.

3 Q. And after the preparation of that

4 document -- well, with regard to that document, what

5 were the allegations set forth in the proposed

6 Complaint to be filed?

7 A. Well, it’s been --

8 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Hearsay;

9 relevance.

10 THE COURT: Sustained.

11 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Who was the individual that

12 the Complaint was directed towards?

13 A. Mr. Jackson.

14 Q. At some point in time, did you have contact

15 with individuals who were representing Mr. Jackson

16 over the proposed filing of the criminal -- of the

17 civil complaint?

18 A. Yes.

19 Q. And who did you make contact with?

20 A. Initially our contacts were with Johnnie

21 Cochran and his associate, Carl Douglas.

22 Q. Do you recall approximately when it was when

23 you first made contact with Mr. -- or when contact

24 was made between you and Mr. Cochran and Mr.

25 Douglas?

26 A. It was either late ‘94 or early ‘95.

27 Q. Did you, after your conversations with those

28 individuals, file the civil lawsuit? 4953



1 A. No.

2 Q. At some point in time later, were you then

3 dealing with other lawyers with regard to the

4 proposed filing of that civil lawsuit?

5 A. Yes. At some point, Mr. Jackson’s

6 representation was assumed by a lawyer named Zia

7 Modabber, and a lawyer named Howard Weitzman.

8 Q. And do you recall approximately when it was

9 that you then began contact with those particular

10 individuals?

11 A. I believe it was in mid 1995.

12 Q. And the purpose of those contacts?

13 A. Well, the --

14 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Vague;

15 foundation.

16 THE COURT: Overruled.

17 You may answer.

18 THE WITNESS: The purpose of the contacts

19 was that they knew that we had a Complaint that we

20 were about to file in Santa Barbara County Superior

21 Court, and they didn’t want us to do that.

22 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Hearsay;

23 foundation.

24 THE COURT: The answer is stricken.

25 Sustained.

26 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: As a result of the

27 conversations between these individuals, did you

28 pursue your lawsuit? 4954



1 A. Well, we never filed the lawsuit.

2 Q. Did you reach an agreement, a settlement

3 agreement?

4 A. Yes, we did.

5 Q. Did you reach a settlement agreement in

6 which Jason Francia received monetary compensation

7 from Mr. Jackson?

8 A. Yes, sir.

9 Q. Did you receive -- did you reach an

10 agreement in which Blanca Francia received monetary

11 compensation from Mr. Jackson?

12 A. Yes, we did.

13 Q. During the time that you were

14 representing -- during the time that you had

15 prepared a Complaint ready to be filed and you were

16 in contact with attorneys representing Mr. Jackson,

17 can you give the ladies and gentlemen of the jury an

18 idea of how old Jason Francia was at that particular

19 point in time?

20 A. Well, he was about 14 years old. He’s 24

21 now, as I understand it, and we’re talking about

22 things that happened just about exactly ten years

23 ago.

24 Q. And in your position as a civil litigator,

25 at the time that an individual is of minority, at

26 the age of 14, how do you deal with representing a

27 person like that?

28 A. Well, a child -- 4955



1 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Vague;

2 foundation; relevance.

3 THE COURT: Overruled.

4 You may complete your answer.

5 THE WITNESS: A child, under California law,

6 under the age of 18, is not permitted to enter into

7 a contract. I suppose he or she could, but it

8 wouldn’t be enforceable. So the only way a child

9 can act legally is through a guardian ad litem. And

10 it’s normally the parent and normally the mother.

11 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Was that the case in this

12 particular instance?

13 A. Yes.

14 Q. Now, during the course of the time that you

15 were involved in obtaining a settlement from Mr.

16 Jackson on behalf of the Francias, did you deal

17 personally with Jason at any time?

18 A. Yeah. Sure.

19 Q. In what respect?

20 A. Well, I knew who he was, I met with him. I

21 met with he and his mom. He was a teenaged boy, and

22 a nice young man.

23 Q. Now, at some point in time was Jason

24 required to sign some kind of documents in

25 conjunction with the settlement?

26 A. Yes. When he turned 18, part of the

27 condition was that he sign a confidentiality

28 agreement. 4956



1 Q. Now, with regard to the confidentiality --

2 and to your knowledge, did he sign that?

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. And with regard to the confidentiality

5 agreement, did it have a provision that required

6 notice to Mr. Jackson in the event that Jason

7 Francia talked to anybody?

8 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Leading; move to

9 strike.

10 THE COURT: Overruled.

11 You may answer.

12 THE WITNESS: I believe so, yes.

13 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: And what was the

14 requirement notice in the confidentiality agreement

15 with regard to notice to the defense?

16 A. I believe it’s five days.

17 Q. And were you at some point contacted by Mr.

18 Zonen of our department with regard to interviewing

19 your -- Jason Francia?

20 A. Yes.

21 Q. And in that particular case, did you

22 indicate to Mr. Zonen that you would have to do

23 something before you could agree with that?

24 A. Yes.

25 Q. And what was that?

26 A. Well, I’d have to notify somebody on Mr.

27 Jackson’s legal staff that they wanted to talk to

28 him. 4957



1 Q. And did you do that?

2 A. Yeah. Yes. Excuse me.

3 Q. And did you then grant permission for Mr.

4 Zonen to have a conversation with your -- with Jason

5 Francia?

6 A. Yes.

7 Q. Now, were you present during the

8 conversations between Jason Francia and Mr. Zonen?

9 A. I don’t think so. I think I was there, and

10 then I think I had to go to another court or

11 something like that. I don’t remember being an

12 integral part of any of those -- if there was more

13 than one, I don’t even know.

14 Q. And I’m talking about the conversations that

15 occurred after you gave notice to the defense in

16 this case, or gave notice to Mr. Jackson. To your

17 knowledge, was Mr. Cannon present?

18 A. I believe so. At least for part of it.

19 Again, I’m not certain.

20 Q. Do you remember when it was that you

21 finally -- the year that you finally reached a

22 settlement agreement with Mr. Jackson?

23 A. Yes. It’s been a long time. But it was a

24 big deal. And I do remember --

25 MR. MESEREAU: Objection. Nonresponsive;

26 move to strike.

27 THE COURT: The answer is stricken.

28 Nonresponsive. 4958



1 Q. BY MR. SNEDDON: Just --

2 A. Yes.

3 Q. And what year was that, approximately?

4 A. It was either ‘95 or ‘96, I believe.

5 THE COURT: Counsel, we’ll take our break.

1 THE COURT: Counsel?

2 MR. SNEDDON: Your Honor, I’ve just about

3 completed my examination. But I would request if we

4 could approach the bench for just one second. I

5 don’t want to run afoul of the Court.

6 THE COURT: All right.

7 (Discussion held off the record at sidebar.)

8 THE COURT: (To the jury) All right. Knock

9 it off.

10 (Laughter.)

11 THE COURT: Okay. Counsel, you may proceed.

12 MR. SNEDDON: All right.

13 Q. Mr. Kallman, I think I just have a couple

14 questions left.

15 I think where we were headed before the

16 break was you told us the approximate year in which

17 the case actually reached a settlement.

18 And what I wanted to know was, after the

19 settlement of the case, have you kept in contact

20 with Jason over the years?

21 A. Yes.

22 Q. And to your knowledge, has Mr. Cannon kept

23 in contact with Jason over the years?

24 A. I believe so.

25 Q. Now, with regard to the lawsuit that was

26 contemplated against Mr. Jackson at the time, the

27 basis of the -- of the nature of the representation

28 of Jason Francia involved inappropriate sexual 4965



1 conduct against Jason by the defendant, Mr. Jackson?

2 A. Yes.

3 MR. SNEDDON: Nothing further, Your Honor.

4 THE COURT: Cross-examine?

5 MR. MESEREAU: Yes, please. Your Honor.

6

7 CROSS-EXAMINATION

8 BY MR. MESEREAU:

9 Q. Good morning, Mr. Kallman.

10 A. Good morning.

11 Q. My name is Thomas Mesereau and I speak for

12 Mr. Jackson.

13 A. Pleasure to meet you.

14 Q. I want to ask you some questions about the

15 settlement agreement you referred to in response to

16 the prosecutor’s questions, okay?

17 First of all, you had separate settlement

18 agreements for the mother, Blanca Francia, and the

19 son, Jason Francia, correct?

20 A. I believe so. I can tell you, I have not

21 reviewed this material and it’s been ten years, but

22 I believe that was the case. Some of this I’m going

23 to have to take your word for it.

24 Q. Well, I can show you a copy if you need it.

25 A. I don’t disbelieve that.

26 Q. Okay. The settlement agreement with Blanca

27 Francia was entered into approximately April 1st,

28 1996, right? 4966



1 A. I don’t know.

2 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I show

3 you a copy of the agreement?

4 A. Sure.

5 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor?

6 THE COURT: Yes.

7 THE WITNESS: That’s what it says.

8 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: The settlement agreement

9 with Jason Francia was entered into approximately

10 June 1st, 1998, right?

11 A. Don’t know.

12 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I just

13 show you a copy of it?

14 A. Sure.

15 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor?

16 THE COURT: Yes.

17 THE WITNESS: That’s what it says.

18 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Okay. Now, that would

19 suggest, wouldn’t it, that the mother had agreed to

20 get money for herself before there was any agreement

21 for Jason to get money in a settlement, right?

22 A. No, it was all part of one global

23 settlement.

24 Q. Then why would there be a two-year

25 difference between the execution of those settlement

26 agreements?

27 A. Remember when I told the jury that a minor

28 can’t enter into a contract? 4967



1 Q. Yes.

2 A. Jason wouldn’t have been able to sign before

3 he was 18. My guess is that’s probably when he

4 turned 18, and that’s what Mr. Weitzman and Modabber

5 wanted.

6 Q. And then just for the jury’s benefit, why

7 would the mother sign in ‘96?

8 A. She was an adult. She could sign.

9 Q. The point I’m making is that she had a

10 separate settlement from her son.

11 A. Exactly. I mean -- yes. She got money.

12 Q. Yes. Okay. Now, the prosecutor asked you

13 some questions about provisions in the settlement

14 agreement, okay? And one of the issues that was

15 carefully negotiated by the people representing Mr.

16 Jackson was that he deny any wrongdoing in that

17 agreement, right?

18 A. Again, the best evidence of that would be

19 what’s in the agreement. I don’t remember what’s in

20 there.

21 Q. Okay. Well, let me -- the prosecutor read

22 you a provision, asked you about it.

23 Let me ask you about this: There was

24 language in that agreement that said, “The parties

25 acknowledge that Jackson has elected to settle the

26 claims solely in view of the potential impact any

27 litigation could have in the future on his

28 reputation, earnings and potential income, and not 4968



1 because of any alleged wrongful conduct on his

2 part,” right?

3 A. If you’re asking me if that’s in the

4 document, I’ll have to take your word for it. You

5 don’t need to show it to me. It sounds pretty

6 standard to me.

7 Q. The agreement further said -- excuse me, let

8 me rephrase that.

9 Both agreements, the one involving Jason and

10 the one involving Blanca, his mother, both had

11 language which said, “This agreement shall not, in

12 any manner, be construed as an admission by Jackson

13 that he has acted wrongfully with respect to

14 Francia, Blanca, or any other person, or at all, or

15 that Francia or Blanca have any rights whatsoever

16 against Jackson or Jackson’s releasees.” Sound

17 familiar to you?

18 A. It sounds like standard language in

19 virtually every release that I deal with. But, yes,

20 it does sound familiar.

21 Q. Actually, there’s a whole separate paragraph

22 entitled, “Denial of Claims by Mr. Jackson,”

23 correct?

24 A. Don’t know.

25 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I show

26 you a copy?

27 A. It would.

28 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach, Your Honor? 4969



1 THE COURT: Yes.

2 THE WITNESS: It does refresh my

3 recollection.

4 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Okay. And do you recall

5 that language being in both agreements?

6 A. I believe so, yes, sir.

7 Q. Okay. In addition to the language that I

8 have read, there’s further language which says,

9 “Jackson specifically disclaims any liability to,

10 and denies any wrongful acts against, Francia,

11 Blanca or any other person and may continue to do so

12 publicly, to the extent reasonably necessary, to

13 respond to any inquiries in this regard.” Right?

14 A. Correct.

15 Q. It said further, “The parties acknowledge

16 that Jackson is a public figure, and that his name,

17 image and likeness have commercial value and are an

18 important element of his earning capacity.” Right?

19 A. That’s true.

20 Q. And that language was in both settlement

21 agreements, the one involving Blanca Francia and the

22 one involving Jason Francia, correct?

23 A. I don’t remember that. I will take your

24 word for it. You don’t need to refresh my

25 recollection. It sounds like it should be or would

26 be.

27 Q. Now, Mr. Kallman, provisions in which a

28 settling party denies liability are fairly standard 4970



1 in settlement agreements, right?

2 A. True.

3 Q. But the language that I just read to the

4 jury is not standard language in a settlement

5 agreement, is it?

6 A. This is not a standard case, or was not.

7 And no, you’re right. These were carefully drafted

8 by a team of lawyers, and we agreed to the terms.

9 Q. And the reason those terms are different is

10 because Mr. Jackson is an unusual individual in

11 terms of his need to preserve his reputation and

12 public image so he can earn a living, right?

13 MR. SNEDDON: Calls for speculation on this.

14 It wasn’t drafted by him. No foundation.

15 MR. MESEREAU: I think it was drafted by

16 this witness.

17 THE COURT: All right. I’ll sustain a

18 foundation.

19 MR. MESEREAU: Okay.

20 Q. When you settled these matters - and I’m

21 talking about matters involving Michael Jackson,

22 Blanca Francia, and Jason Francia - you put in

23 language involving denial of claims by Mr. Jackson

24 that was not standard language in a typical

25 settlement agreement, right?

26 MR. SNEDDON: Your Honor, I’m going to

27 object to the question as lack of foundation; that

28 he put the language in there. 4971



1 THE COURT: Well, that was the foundation I

2 was looking for.

3 So I’ll allow you to answer the question as

4 long as you understand the limitations of your

5 answer.

6 THE WITNESS: Well --

7 THE COURT: If you put the language in.

8 THE WITNESS: I didn’t draft that agreement.

9 THE COURT: Okay.

10 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Did lawyers from your

11 office draft the agreement?

12 A. No.

13 Q. Who drafted the agreement?

14 A. Somebody in Mr. Modabber’s office, the

15 Katten, Muchin, Zavis & Weitzman firm in Century

16 City.

17 Q. Did you have any input into the language in

18 the agreement?

19 A. Only to review it. And if there was

20 language we found objectionable, we could strike it,

21 I suppose.

22 Q. Okay.

23 A. But they wanted that in there, and I didn’t

24 find it objectionable.

25 Q. Okay. Now, you made a statement, I believe,

26 in response to the prosecutor’s questions, that if

27 someone from law enforcement wanted to speak to your

28 client, you had to first notify representatives of 4972



1 Mr. Jackson, true?

2 A. True.

3 Q. That -- really, that language is not in that

4 agreement, is it?

5 A. I don’t know.

6 Q. Then why would you say it?

7 A. Because that’s part -- in one of the

8 agreements, I have to give notice to the defense

9 team. And I’ve given notice once to Mr. Sanger.

10 And then when I got subpoenaed on Friday, I gave

11 notice to Mr. Modabber down in Los Angeles.

12 Q. But the notice you’re supposed to give to

13 the defense team does not involve requests by law

14 enforcement to speak to your client, does it?

15 A. I assume that anybody from law enforcement

16 that wants to talk to my client, there was a

17 requirement to notify somebody from the defense

18 team.

19 Q. Nowhere in those settlement agreements is

20 there language to that effect, is there?

21 A. I have no idea.

22 MR. SNEDDON: Object as immaterial;

23 irrelevant.

24 MR. MESEREAU: The prosecutor brought it up

25 on direct, Your Honor.

26 THE COURT: The objection is overruled. And

27 the answer came in as, “I have no idea.”

28 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: It would be against public 4973



1 policy for a civil litigator to put language in a

2 settlement agreement precluding anyone from

3 cooperating with law enforcement, wouldn’t it?

4 A. In my opinion, yes.

5 Q. Lawyers are not allowed to have language

6 like that in settlement agreements, right?

7 A. Wrong.

8 Q. Pardon me?

9 A. No. It’s a notice requirement. It’s not a

10 preclusion requirement.

11 Q. When did you last review the notice

12 provisions in these agreements?

13 A. Probably in 1996 or 1997.

14 Q. Well, let me ask you this question: Did you

15 talk with Mr. Sneddon about what questions he was

16 going to ask you before you testified today?

17 A. No. I mean, we talked, but it was very,

18 very general and I don’t think the conversation was

19 more than five or ten minutes long.

20 Q. Okay. The notice provisions that you

21 describe talk primarily about anyone who’s suing Mr.

22 Jackson or if he’s contacted by the media, correct?

23 A. I don’t -- not the notice provisions I’m

24 thinking about. I think there’s a specific

25 provision -- it may not be in that agreement. Maybe

26 it’s in another agreement, but there’s a provision

27 that I’m supposed to contact either Johnnie Cochran

28 or Zia Modabber or somebody on the defense team if 4974



1 there was a request to speak or interview my

2 clients.

3 Q. But never in the agreement did it refer to

4 law enforcement, right?

5 A. That I don’t remember. It’s been a long

6 time.

7 Q. Okay. Okay. Now, you answered some

8 questions about Terry Cannon.

9 A. Yes, sir.

10 Q. When did -- excuse me, you’re currently

11 associated with Mr. Cannon, correct?

12 A. He is “of counsel” to my law firm.

13 Q. When did he become “of counsel” to your law

14 firm.

15 A. He’s been “of counsel” twice. Once about

16 ten years ago, during this period, and then again

17 just recently, within the last two months.

18 Q. So he wasn’t “of counsel” to your law firm

19 in October, November and December of last year,

20 right?

21 A. I don’t believe so, but I can’t be sure.

22 Q. During October, November and December of

23 last year, he was with the District Attorney’s

24 Office in San Diego, wasn’t he?

25 A. Well, I know he recently retired from the

26 San Diego D.A.’s Office. I don’t know precisely

27 when he retired, but you’re right, it’s been recent.

28 MR. MESEREAU: Okay. No further questions, 4975



1 Your Honor.

2 MR. SNEDDON: No questions, Your Honor.

3 THE COURT: All right. Thank you. You may

4 step down.

5 THE WITNESS: Thank you, Your Honor.

6 MR. ZONEN: We’ll call Blanca Francia to the

7 stand.

23 THE CLERK: Please be seated. State and

24 spell your name for the record.

27 BAILIFF CORTEZ: Ma’am, you need to move

28 over here, please. 4976



1 THE WITNESS: Oh.

2 MR. ZONEN: Would you like her to spell her

3 name again?

4 THE COURT: Did the court reporter get the

5 spelling?

6 THE REPORTER: Yes.

7 THE COURT: That’s fine.

8 THE JURY: (In unison) We didn’t.

9 (Laughter.)

10 THE COURT: Yes, please ask her to spell her

11 name again.

12 MR. ZONEN: Could you please spell your name

13 again?

14 THE WITNESS: B-l-a-n-c-a; F-r-a-n-c-i-a.

12 A. In Los Olivos.

13 Q. And was that Neverland?

15 Q. Was that the ranch that he actually did

16 purchase?

20 They sent me over here before he moved in.

21 I mean --

22 Q. I’m not sure I understood that, “They sent

23 me over here before he moved in.” Who is “they,”

24 first of all?

25 A. Well, they arrange, Mr. Jackson and Bill

26 Bray and one of the secretaries.

27 Q. Okay. Bill Bray was who?

28 A. His personal assistant I guess. 4983

16 Maria?

17 A. I guess about nine.

18 Q. About nine years old?

19 A. Eight or nine, yeah.

20 Q. Okay. Did you continue working for Mr.

21 Jackson after you moved to Santa Maria?

22 A. Excuse me?

23 Q. Did you continuing to work for Mr. Jackson --

24 A. Yes.

11 everything.

12 Q. What was your schedule at Neverland? How

13 often did you work there?

14 A. In the beginning, I think I was just -- he

15 was there, I will come, you know, and work for three

16 days, whatever time he will stay there, and then,

17 you know, not to be there for another two days. But

18 eventually he move to -- like to 9:00 to 5:00.

19 Q. Five days a week?

20 A. Five days a week. Six days.

21 Q. Six days? Did you ever work more than 9:00

22 to 5:00?

23 A. Yeah.

24 Q. Your hours, times, would they vary different

25 days?

26 A. Yeah. Christmastime and -- you know,

27 whatever time they needed me, because he was there.

28 Q. Were there occasions that you would work 4985



1 late?

2 A. Yes.

3 Q. And you say six days a week. Was that

4 common?

5 A. Was that what?

6 Q. Was that a common event, that you would work

7 six days a week?

8 A. Yeah.

9 Q. Okay. During that time, did you ever bring

10 Jason with you to work? And by “this time,” I’m

11 referring to at Neverland.

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. Okay. Did you ever bring Jason to work with

14 you at the Havenhurst residence in Encino?

15 A. Yes, it was.

16 Q. Did you ever bring Jason to work with you at

17 the hideout on Wilshire Boulevard?

18 A. Yeah.

19 Q. And why did you do that?

20 A. Well, the first time I didn’t know that

21 I was allowed to do it. But Mr. Jackson asked me

22 to -- to bring him.

23 Q. You said the first time. Where was that?

24 A. At the Encino house.

25 Q. At the Encino house?

26 A. Yeah.

27 Q. Did he say why?

28 A. He just told me to bring him. 4986



1 Q. Okay. And did you bring him on occasion?

2 A. Yeah. From then on, he was there a lot of

3 times.

4 Q. Okay. How often would you bring him to the

5 residence at Encino?

6 A. Probably every weekend. And probably twice

7 a month, then, different -- differently. I don’t

8 remember.

9 Q. Was that schedule more or less at the

10 hideout? Did you bring him to the hideout as often?

11 More often?

12 A. Uh-huh.

13 Q. Less often? What?

14 A. Not a lot of times, because he was in

15 school, so probably on Saturday or Sundays.

16 Q. Did you continue cleaning at the hideout

17 even after Mr. Jackson moved to Neverland in ‘88?

18 A. Yes.

19 Q. How often?

20 A. Probably every week. Sometimes twice a

21 week.

22 Q. At Neverland, what were your specific

23 responsibilities? What were your obligations? What

24 did you do at Neverland?

25 A. Do you mean for him?

26 Q. Yes, for Mr. Jackson. Yes.

27 A. Like I said, taking care of his clothes, his

28 room. 4987



1 Q. Okay.

2 A. And right after he leave the room, I will

3 have to clean it right away, because sometime he

4 will stay there, you know, he’ll come out, and then

5 he’ll go back in right away.

6 Q. Okay. Were your responsibilities beyond his

7 room as well? In other words, did you clean the

8 rest of the house?

9 A. Yes.

10 Q. Did you ever clean other buildings at

11 Neverland?

12 A. Yes.

22 A. Yes.

23 Q. -- who were -- there were other maids at

24 Neverland?

25 A. Yes.

26 Q. Yes, all right. At any given time, how many

27 maids were working at Neverland at any given time?

28 A. Maybe about six. 4988



1 Q. Were there others who had responsibility for

2 cleaning Mr. Jackson’s bedroom?

3 A. No.

4 Q. You were the only one?

5 A. Yeah.

6 Q. Did you have a key?

7 A. Yes.

8 Q. Is that the only way you got in?

9 A. Yeah.

10 Q. Was there a combination lock at any point?

11 A. No.

12 Q. Not while you were there? Is that a key

13 that you carried around with you?

14 A. Yes.

15 Q. Okay. Would you just let yourself in?

16 A. Yes.

17 Q. How would you announce your presence? How

18 would you let Mr. Jackson know you were coming in,

19 if, in fact, he was there?

20 A. I’ll knock.

21 Q. Uh-huh. Now, could you describe the suite

22 that is his bedroom? It’s actually more than one

23 room; is that right?

24 A. Yeah. It’s two rooms. One downstairs and

25 one upstairs.

26 Q. And is there a hallway that goes into it?

27 A. Closet.

28 Q. I’m sorry? 4989



1 A. A closet.

25 I left for vacation.

26 Q. And for how long was that?

19 time he came? In other words, how long after the

20 first visit was the final visit, to your knowledge?

21 A. I don’t remember. It was, I guess, about a

19 A. I remember this time he was this -- on this

20 side, and my son was on this side. And I got there

21 about three or four times, and one time he was -- my

22 son was --

23 MR. MESEREAU: Objection; nonresponsive.

24 THE COURT: It’s kind of hard to tell. Maybe

25 you could start with another question.

26 MR. ZONEN: Yes, I can.

27 Q. I asked you initially how they were

28 positioned. In other words, were they facing each 5018



1 other? Were they facing away from each other? Do

2 you recall? When you saw them the first time.

23 A. Yes.

24 Q. When you asked him to come out to go eat, in

25 what language was that?

26 A. I think I said it in Spanish. But then I

27 want Mr. Jackson to understand what I was telling

28 him to do, and so I guess I said it in Spanish and 5020



1 English. I don’t remember.

2 Q. So you’re not certain at this point?

3 A. No.

4 Q. All right. Did he get out of the sleeping

8 MR. ZONEN: Spontaneous declaration, Your

9 Honor.

10 THE COURT: I’m going to allow the answer to

11 the question of, “What did you say?” which I think

12 is the objection you were making.

13 MR. MESEREAU: Has to do with third-party

14 statements, Your Honor.

15 MR. ZONEN: I’m sorry.

16 THE COURT: I’m going to ask you to rephrase

17 the question. The question you last asked where the

18 objection came was, “And what did you say?” And she

19 did say what she said. But then she was going to

20 say something else.

21 MR. ZONEN: Yes. Thank you.

4 A. That he has the money; that it was a secret;

5 he wasn’t going to tell me.

6 Q. Okay.

7 A. But at this point I thought it was maybe two

8 dollars or a dollar.

9 Q. Did you ask to see it?

10 A. And I say, “I want to see it.” And he say,

11 “No, because Michael told me that it’s for me and

12 not to tell you.” But like I say, I thought it was

13 two dollars. I say, “How much is it?”

14 And I pull it out of his pocket.

15 Q. It was in his pocket?

16 A. It was in his pocket. He said he put --

17 Q. Do you remember what he was wearing?

18 A. Pants.

19 Q. You believe it was pants?

6 did know, Your Honor.

7 THE WITNESS: He told me he was on tour,

8 but --

9 MR. ZONEN: There’s an objection.

10 THE WITNESS: You know --

11 THE COURT: The only one she said she didn’t

12 know were the last two, so I’ll overrule the

14 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: So you knew he traveled to

15 Italy on that tour, correct?

20 Q. Did you appear to be the primary

21 housecleaner?

22 A. Well, while Mr. Jackson was on tour, I end

23 up staying, cleaning the house too.

24 Q. Okay. So when he was out of town, you would

25 still go there to work, right?

26 A. Yeah.

27 Q. Now, would you bring Jason there when --

28 A. Yes. 5063

19 Q. Now, how long did you work -- excuse me.

20 Let me rephrase that.

21 For how long a period of time did you clean

22 the house at Havenhurst?

23 A. While he was on tour, I guess. I don’t

24 remember. But it was many months, because Bill Bray

25 told me that at least it’s going to be about six

26 months that he was going to be out of -- out of the

27 country, and either I be laid off or work at the

28 house. 5064



1 Q. Okay. And did there come a point in time

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. And approximately when was that, if you

5 remember?

6 A. No.

7 Q. Okay. Was it 1986, do you think?

8 A. No.

14 at Havenhurst, you kept working for Mr. Jackson,

15 right?

16 A. Yes.

17 Q. And what did you do for Mr. Jackson after

18 you stopped cleaning the house on Havenhurst?

19 A. Well, went back to my same routine.

20 Cleaning his room and mainly being there. Even if I

21 didn’t have anything to do, he wanted me in his

22 room.

23 Q. Okay. And which room are you talking about

24 now?

25 A. His bedroom.

26 Q. Okay. His bedroom now?

27 A. In Encino.

28 Q. In Encino, okay. Okay. So Mr. Jackson 5065



1 would leave town, but always wanted you to still

2 come to the house and do your work, right?

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. And you said that Mr. Bray told you

5 something about you might lose your work?

6 A. No, no, no. He told me that I either be

7 laid off or -- well, probably it’s the same thing,

8 or work at the house.

9 Q. Okay. Okay. When you stopped working at

10 the house on Havenhurst, what were you doing then

11 for Mr. Jackson?

12 A. When I stopped working at the Havenhurst --

13 do you mean at the house?

14 Q. Yes. You kept working for Mr. Jackson,

20 Q. And where were you doing that?

21 A. Cleaning his room. At the Havenhurst.

22 Q. No, no, after you stopped working at

23 Havenhurst.

24 A. Oh.

25 Q. Okay?

26 A. Uh-huh.

27 Q. You worked at Havenhurst for a while, right?

28 A. Yeah. 5066

5 Q. Okay. I’m sorry. Maybe I’m confusing you.

6 There was a point in time when you didn’t

7 clean Havenhurst anymore; is that right?

8 A. Uh-huh.

9 Q. And approximately when was that, do you

10 think?

11 A. No, I don’t remember.

12 Q. Okay. You did work at Neverland at one

13 point, right?

14 A. Yeah, that was back after about three years.

15 Q. And when you worked at Neverland, were you

16 still working at Havenhurst?

17 A. When I still working --

18 Q. I’m sorry?

19 A. -- at Neverland?

20 Q. Yes. Let me rephrase the question.

21 When you were working for Mr. Jackson at

22 Neverland - okay? - were you still doing work at the

23 home on Havenhurst?

24 A. No.

25 Q. You were working full time at Neverland

26 then, right?

27 A. No.

28 Q. No? 5067



1 A. I would go to the hideout.

2 Q. Okay.

3 A. And sometime he will tell me to go to

4 Havenhurst to get stuff, or retrieve something,

5 or --

6 Q. So when you were living at Neverland and

7 working at Neverland, you still would sometimes go

8 to Havenhurst, right?

9 A. Yes. Sometimes.

10 Q. But most of the time you did your work at

11 Neverland, right?

12 A. Neverland and the hideout.

13 Q. Okay. Okay. Now, Mr. Jackson was very

14 generous to you, wasn’t he?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. He gave you a couple of televisions; is that

17 right?

18 A. Yes.

19 Q. And you would also ask him from time to time

20 if you could take something, and he would often say

21 “Yes,” right?

22 A. (Nods head up and down.)

23 Q. What are some of the things that you asked

24 him that you’d like to have?

25 A. Knickknacks. And clothes. He gave me a

26 couple of jackets from his tour, I think. I don’t

27 remember. It was -- there were a lot of stuff.

28 Q. And did he give you any cash himself? 5068



1 A. I don’t remember.

2 Q. Didn’t he give you approximately $5,000

3 total at one point?

4 A. I don’t remember.

5 Q. Wouldn’t he give you 500 or 300 or $200 at a

6 time?

7 A. I don’t remember.

8 Q. Do you remember saying that in your

9 deposition with Mr. Feldman?

10 A. Yeah. I probably did, yeah.

11 Q. So let me ask you what you remember.

12 A. Uh-huh.

13 Q. Do you remember Mr. Jackson giving you 500

14 or 300 or $200 at a time?

15 A. He probably did, but at this time I don’t

16 remember.

17 Q. Okay. Do you remember saying in your

18 deposition that, in total, he may have given you

19 $5,000?

20 A. I probably did.

21 Q. Okay. Does that sound accurate to you?

22 A. Yeah, probably, I did. It wasn’t that much,

23 probably, but I don’t remember how much he gave me.

24 Q. Okay. But would you ask him for cash

25 sometimes?

26 A. No.

27 Q. Would he just volunteer and give it to you?

28 A. I don’t remember that, you know. I don’t -- 5069



1 I don’t -- I think so, but I don’t remember.

2 Q. Okay. I’m probably not being clear. I’m

3 asking why Mr. Jackson gave you money. Would you

4 ask him for money once in a while?

5 A. I think I did -- I don’t remember.

6 Q. Okay. But you do remember him giving you

7 money from time to time, right?

8 A. Yeah.

9 Q. Okay. And you’re not sure of the total,

10 right?

11 A. No.

12 Q. Okay. And did he give you money from time

13 to time during the entire period that you worked for

14 him?

15 A. Someone -- yeah.

16 Q. Okay. And you don’t recall him ever saying

17 “No” if you ever told him you needed some money, did

18 he?

19 A. No.

20 Q. Okay. He always was generous with you with

21 money, wasn’t he?

22 A. Yeah. Yes.

23 Q. Okay. All right. Now, your deposition was

24 taken in 1993, right? Do you remember that?

25 A. I don’t remember.

26 Q. Okay.

27 A. But I think it was ‘94. I don’t remember.

28 Q. Would it refresh your recollection if I just 5070



1 show you the transcript with a date on it? Would

2 that help you remember?

3 A. I mean, I’ll read it and -- I know that it

4 was that, but I don’t remember.

5 Q. If you saw the transcript, might that help

6 you remember? Would you like to see it?

7 A. Yeah. I mean, you can put whatever that you

8 want to and I will say probably.

9 Q. No, I don’t want to do that. Would it help

10 refresh your recollection --

11 A. No.

12 Q. -- if I just show you the date on the

13 deposition?

14 MR. ZONEN: Your Honor, I’d be prepared to

15 stipulate to the two dates of the transcript.

16 MR. MESEREAU: Okay. Sure.

17 MR. ZONEN: And the first date is December

18 15, 1993.

19 MR. SNEDDON: Can’t hear you.

20 MR. ZONEN: The first date --

21 MR. SNEDDON: Turn it on.

22 MR. ZONEN: We make this complicated, don’t

23 we?

24 The first date is December 15, 1993. The

25 date of the second day of the deposition was January

26 11, 1994. I would so stipulate.

27 MR. MESEREAU: So stipulated.

28 THE COURT: All right. I’ll approve that 5071



1 stipulation.

2 THE WITNESS: I do remember ‘94. But I

3 don’t remember the dates.

4 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Okay. Okay. Do you

5 remember in your deposition saying you had never

6 seen Mr. Jackson touch anyone improperly?

7 A. Yeah, I --

8 Q. Do you remember saying you never saw him

9 touch anyone?

10 A. Yeah.

11 Q. You did say that, didn’t you?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. Okay. And in that deposition, you told the

14 truth, right?

15 A. As -- as I recall it at that time, yeah.

16 Q. You told the truth at that time, right?

17 A. As I remember it.

18 Q. Yes. And you were under oath, right?

19 A. Yes.

20 Q. Okay. And you said that you had never seen

21 Michael Jackson touch anyone in a sexual way, right?

22 A. Yeah.

23 Q. Okay. And you said at no time while you

24 worked for Michael Jackson did you ever see him have

25 sexual contact with anyone, right?

26 A. When I say “sexual,” I mean sexual.

27 Q. But you did say under oath that you had

28 never saw Mr. Jackson have sexual contact with 5072



1 anyone, right?

2 A. No. No.

3 Q. Isn’t that what you said?

4 A. Yeah, yeah, that’s what I said.

5 Q. Okay. Now, you mentioned that Mr. Jackson

6 has a Jacuzzi, right?

7 A. Where at? At the Havenhurst?

9 A. Uh-huh.

10 Q. Did Mr. Jackson have a Jacuzzi at

11 Havenhurst?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. And just tell the jury where the Jacuzzi

14 was, please.

15 A. It’s outside his patio.

16 Q. Okay.

17 A. Outside of his bedroom.

18 Q. And did various family members use that

19 Jacuzzi?

20 A. No.

21 Q. Did you ever see anyone use that Jacuzzi at

22 Havenhurst?

23 A. Only Mr. Jackson.

24 Q. And it was outside?

25 A. Yes.

26 Q. Okay. Can you see that Jacuzzi from the

27 house?

28 A. No. 5073



1 Q. Can you see it from any windows?

2 A. Not from the house. From a separate -- from

3 a separate -- from -- I think from up on the garage,

4 you can see it, but it’s not a bedroom.

5 Q. Did you ever see Mr. Jackson in that Jacuzzi

6 at Havenhurst?

7 A. I remember one time.

8 Q. One time seeing Mr. Jackson use the Jacuzzi

9 at Havenhurst?

10 A. Yeah.

11 Q. Okay. But you didn’t see anyone else ever

12 use it?

13 A. There was a little -- a boy there.

14 Q. Did you ever see his parents use the

15 Jacuzzi?

22 A. No.

23 Q. Ever see anyone use it besides Mr. Jackson?

24 A. No.

25 Q. All right. Was there a Jacuzzi at

26 Neverland?

27 A. Well, inside his bedroom there is a bathroom

28 with a Jacuzzi in it. 5074



1 Q. Okay. And you saw Mr. Jackson use that

2 Jacuzzi, didn’t you?

3 A. Yeah.

4 Q. Is it downstairs or upstairs in his bedroom

5 area?

6 A. Downstairs.

7 Q. It’s downstairs; is that right?

8 A. His bedroom, yeah.

9 Q. Okay. Now, the prosecutor asked you

10 questions about Mr. Robeson, okay?

11 A. Uh-huh.

12 Q. And did you say that Mr. Jackson was

13 sleeping on a bed in the lower level of his bedroom?

14 A. Yes.

15 Q. Okay. You didn’t see him sleeping in the

16 bedroom on the upper level?

17 A. No.

18 Q. And was it your belief that during the time

19 you worked at Neverland, that Mr. Jackson only slept

20 on the bed on the lower level?

21 A. Yes. There were times that the other bed

22 was used.

23 Q. Okay.

24 A. But I never saw him in that bedroom.

25 Q. So you would see the bed upstairs used, but

26 you didn’t know who had used it, right?

27 A. No.

28 Q. You would see the bed downstairs used, but 5075



1 you didn’t know who used it, right?

2 A. It was time when it was just one -- one bed

3 was undone.

4 Q. Sometimes, right?

5 A. Sometimes.

6 Q. And sometimes there was a bed upstairs that

7 seemed undone, right?

8 A. Yeah.

9 Q. And you were responsible for making both

10 beds, right?

11 A. Yes.

12 Q. Okay. Have you ever seen Mr. Jackson lying

13 on his bed watching television?

14 A. Yeah. A couple of times.

15 Q. How many times did you see Mr. Jackson lying

16 on his bed watching television?

17 A. Probably a couple of times.

18 Q. And you would see him watch videos also,

19 right?

20 A. Yeah.

21 Q. Were you often in Mr. Jackson’s room when he

22 was watching television?

23 A. No.

24 Q. You typically cleaned his room when he

25 wasn’t there, right?

26 A. Yeah.

27 Q. Is that true?

28 A. Yes. 5076



1 Q. And it was your understanding that you were

2 supposed to clean his room when he wasn’t in there,

3 right?

4 A. No.

5 Q. Was it your understanding that you weren’t

6 supposed to go in when Mr. Jackson was in the room?

7 A. Yeah. Sometimes I’ll unlock his room and

8 he’ll be there, and he tell me that it was okay to

9 come in.

10 Q. Okay. And sometimes you would unlock his

11 door, he’d ask you not to come in, right?

12 A. Yeah.

13 Q. Most of the time when you cleaned his room

14 at Neverland, he wasn’t in it, right?

15 A. Most of the time when he wasn’t in?

16 Q. Let me rephrase. Let me rephrase.

17 During the time you worked at Neverland,

18 most of the time when you cleaned his room, he

19 wasn’t in there, right?

20 A. Yeah.

21 Q. You okay?

22 Do you want some water?

23 A. Huh?

24 Q. Do you want some water?

25 A. No, that’s okay.

26 Q. Was it your understanding that when you

27 cleaned Mr. Jackson’s room you were usually supposed

28 to do it when he wasn’t around? 5077



1 A. Yeah.

2 Q. Okay. Okay. And if you opened the door and

3 he was in there, you would ask for permission to

4 come in, right?

5 A. Yes.

6 Q. Okay. Now, his bedroom is a very big area,

7 isn’t it?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. How would you describe it?

10 A. Big.

11 Q. Very big, isn’t it?

12 A. Uh-huh. Yeah.

13 Q. And how do you get into his bedroom? If

14 you’re going -- let me rephrase it. If you’re going

15 into Mr. Jackson’s room, what do you have to do to

16 get in?

17 A. Open the door with a key.

18 Q. Okay. And is that what you would typically

19 do?

20 A. Yes.

21 Q. Was there any kind of a bell that would

22 ring?

23 A. Yes.

24 Q. And would the bell always ring when you

25 entered?

26 A. Yeah. But it -- it doesn’t have a -- you

27 know, it would ring just once.

28 Q. Right. Just one ring? 5078



1 A. And then close, yeah.

2 Q. Would you then stop it? Would you shut the

3 bell off?

4 A. I used to unplug it.

5 Q. You unplugged it. Okay. So you’d hear a

6 ring, and then you would unplug it; is that right?

7 A. Well, you have to unplug it from the inside

8 of the bedroom.

9 Q. So you’d open the door, right, with a key?

10 A. Yeah.

11 Q. The bell would go off, and then you would

12 unplug it, right?

13 A. When I was there by myself, I used to unplug

14 it.

15 Q. Okay. Okay. And then it would stop

16 ringing, right?

17 A. And it would stop ringing, yeah.

18 Q. And then you would do your cleaning, right?

19 Is that right?

20 A. No.

21 Q. Tell me what --

22 A. I’ll get there --

23 Q. Yes.

24 A. -- and then -- once I get there, I unplug

25 it, because when people get close to it, it rings.

26 But it rings, and then it rings one time, it

27 doesn’t ring anymore.

28 Q. Okay. Okay. To stop it from ringing, you 5079



1 would unplug it?

2 A. Yeah.

3 Q. Okay. Okay. All right. Now, do you know

4 who Quincy Jones is?

5 A. Yes.

6 Q. And who’s Quincy Jones?

7 A. A writer, I think.

8 Q. Okay. And his daughter used to visit

9 Michael, right?

10 A. At Havenhurst.

11 MR. ZONEN: Beyond the scope of the direct,

12 and irrelevant.

13 THE COURT: Overruled. Go ahead.

14 THE WITNESS: At Havenhurst?

15 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Yes.

16 A. I think she was there a couple of times.

17 Q. Her name was Kidada, right?

18 A. I don’t know.

19 Q. But you saw her visit Michael, correct?

20 A. Yes.

22 Ritchie is?

25 Jacksons?

26 A. Not at Havenhurst.

27 Q. Okay. Did you see her visit Michael?

28 A. Him I remember visiting. 5080



1 Q. You remember him visiting Michael. You

2 don’t remember his daughter?

4 Q. Okay. Before you testified today, did you

5 meet with any prosecutor to discuss what you were

6 going to be asked?

7 A. Yeah.

8 Q. And when did that meeting take place?

9 A. Saturday.

10 Q. And who did you meet with?

11 A. I don’t remember his name.

12 Q. Pardon me?

13 A. Ron, I think.

14 Q. Prosecutor Zonen?

15 A. And another one.

16 Q. Okay. And how long did the meeting take

17 place?

18 A. Couple of hours.

19 Q. And how many people were there meeting with

20 you?

21 A. Just the two of them.

22 Q. Did they tell you what they were going to

23 ask you in court?

24 A. They -- they went to what I say before.

25 Q. Did they discuss the questions they were

26 going to ask you today?

13 say when I talk to another detective.

14 Q. Okay.

15 A. Not -- not at my deposition.

16 Q. Okay. So it was a paper that they gave you

17 to look at?

18 A. Yeah.

19 Q. And what was on that paper, if you remember?

11 deposition was taken by him, right?

12 A. Yes. Yes.

14 ago, right? Was that around 1993 sometime?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. Okay. Do you remember how much time Larry

17 Feldman spent with you?

18 A. No.

19 Q. Do you remember if it was a long time?

20 A. I don’t remember.

21 Q. Okay. Was that the only time you met with

22 Attorney Larry Feldman?

23 A. No. Then I was taken to L.A., and I --

24 Q. Did you meet with him again?

25 A. Yeah, for the deposition.

26 Q. Okay. And he was giving you some advice

27 during the deposition, wasn’t he?

28 A. I don’t remember. I don’t think so. 5083



1 Q. Didn’t he advise you from time to time

2 during that deposition?

3 A. I don’t remember. There were a lot of

4 people talking to me at that one.

5 Q. And he was one of them talking to you,

7 A. Yes.

8 Q. And you said that deposition went more than

9 a day, right?

10 A. Yeah. It was twice.

11 Q. Okay. And was it after that deposition that

12 you first spoke to an attorney named Terry Cannon?

13 A. That was -- that was after. After when Mr.

14 Cochran told me that my son was going to be

15 subpoenaed and I would have to bring him.

16 Q. Okay. And then you went to hire an

17 attorney, correct?

18 A. Then I -- yeah, then I talked to Terry.

19 Q. Okay. And has he been your lawyer ever

20 since?

21 A. Yes.

22 Q. Okay. Has he been your son’s lawyer ever

23 since?

24 A. Yes.

25 Q. Okay. When did you last talk to Terry

1 Q. Last December?

2 A. Last December.

3 Q. Okay. Okay. And do you remember having a

4 meeting with Prosecutor Zonen and Terry Cannon last

5 year?

6 A. On December? It was -- Zonen? I don’t know

8 Q. Prosecutor Zonen, who you see right here --

9 A. Oh.

10 Q. -- do you remember meeting with him?

11 A. Oh. Yeah, I think he was -- he was there,

12 too. That’s when they gave me that deposition.

13 Q. Okay. Okay. In your deposition, you said

14 that you had never seen Mr. Jackson molest a child,

15 right?

16 MR. ZONEN: Objection; asked and answered.

17 THE COURT: Overruled.

18 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: In your deposition, you

19 said under oath you had never seen Mr. Jackson

22 Q. Okay. Was it after that deposition that you

23 were interviewed by Hard Copy?

24 A. No.

25 Q. It was before?

26 A. Oh, before I met with him, with -- at my

2 A. Yes.

3 Q. -- right?

4 And that’s the interview you were paid

5 $20,000 --

6 A. Yes.

7 Q. -- to do, right?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. And that’s the interview that you had your

10 friend Evangeline help you arrange, right?

11 A. Yes.

12 Q. And then after you were paid, you said you

13 paid her some money, right?

14 A. Yeah.

15 Q. Okay. Okay. Did you ever talk to anyone

16 from The National Enquirer?

17 A. No.

18 Q. Is Hard Copy the only media --

19 A. Yeah.

20 Q. -- group that you ever met with?

21 A. Yeah. I guess someone tried to -- someone

22 contacted me from National Enquirer, I think, and

23 from Los Angeles Time.

24 Q. In your deposition, you said the people from

25 Hard Copy are not honest, right?

26 A. Yeah.

27 Q. When did you last talk to anyone from Hard

28 Copy? 5086



1 A. When did I -- recently?

2 Q. Let me rephrase it.

3 A. Uh-huh.

4 Q. After your interview with Hard Copy, did you

5 ever talk to them again?

6 A. No.

7 Q. Okay. Did you tell Attorney Larry Feldman

8 that you were going to be interviewed by Hard Copy?

9 A. No.

10 Q. And Evangeline worked at Neverland, right?

11 A. Yes.

12 Q. Did you tell anyone else who worked at

13 Neverland, besides Evangeline, that you were going

14 to be paid to interview with Hard Copy?

15 A. No. Not that I remember.

16 Q. Now, at some point you learned -- let me

17 rephrase that, excuse me. Let me start again.

18 After your interview with Hard Copy appeared

19 on television - okay? - at some point you learned

20 that other employees at Neverland now wanted to be

21 paid to go on television to talk about Mr. Jackson,

22 right?

23 A. Did I know that?

24 Q. Yes.

25 A. No.

26 Q. After you hired a lawyer --

27 A. Uh-huh.

28 Q. -- you learned that other employees at 5087



1 Neverland started hiring lawyers, right?

2 MR. ZONEN: I’ll object. Lack of

3 foundation; speculative.

4 THE WITNESS: I don’t remember that.

5 THE COURT: Wait.

6 The objection’s overruled.

7 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Did you learn at some

8 point after your Hard Copy interview was on

9 television, that now other people who worked for

10 Michael Jackson were hoping they could make money

11 doing media interviews like you did?

12 MR. ZONEN: Objection; speculative.

13 THE WITNESS: No, I didn’t know that.

14 THE COURT: Overruled.

15 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Did you discuss your Hard

16 Copy interview with anyone besides Evangeline at

19 Q. Okay.

20 A. No.

21 Q. Okay. Who did you work for at Neverland?

22 A. Did I work for?

23 Q. Besides Mr. Jackson. I mean, who did you

24 work -- let me rephrase it.

25 Obviously you worked for Mr. Jackson, but

26 did you report to other people?

27 A. Did I report to other people? Oh.

28 Q. As part of your job. 5088



1 A. I was working as part of the household,

2 housekeepers.

3 Q. And who did you work with; do you remember?

4 A. The workers? I don’t remember their names.

5 But I -- I --

6 Q. Okay. Now, the Hard Copy interview was in

7 1993, right?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. It was in December of 1993, right?

10 A. Yes.

11 Q. And you stopped working in 1991, right?

13 Q. So after you left -- after you stopped

14 working for Mr. Jackson, you stayed in touch with

15 some people who worked for Mr. Jackson, right?

16 A. No.

17 Q. What about Evangeline?

18 A. But she wasn’t working there no more.

19 Q. When did she stop?

20 A. Before me.

21 Q. Was she in touch with people at Neverland?

22 MR. ZONEN: Objection; speculation.

23 MR. MESEREAU: To your knowledge.

24 THE WITNESS: Not that I know.

25 MR. ZONEN: There’s an objection.

26 THE COURT: To her knowledge. I’ll limit it.

27 She answered no, not that she knows.

28 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Did you talk to any 5089



1 representative of the media before you had your

2 deposition taken?

3 A. Did I -- did I talk --

4 Q. I’m -- yes, let me rephrase it.

5 A. Uh-huh.

6 Q. And if I’m unclear, just tell me, and I’ll

8 You said your interview with Hard Copy was

9 after the deposition, right?

10 A. No. It was before.

11 Q. It was before. Okay. How long before it,

12 if you know?

14 Q. Okay. Did you discuss the fact that you

15 were going to be interviewed by Hard Copy with any

16 attorney?

17 A. No.

18 Q. Okay. Do you remember Evangeline saying to

19 you, “Would you like to go to The National

20 Enquirer”?

21 A. I don’t remember.

22 Q. Pardon me?

23 A. I don’t remember. I remember a guy called

24 me, but he never told me that someone refer me or --

25 Q. But didn’t Evangeline suggest that you call

26 The National Enquirer?

27 A. No.

28 Q. She didn’t? She didn’t ask you, “Do you 5090



1 want me to find The Enquirer?”

2 A. I don’t remember that, no.

3 Q. Would it refresh your memory if I just show

4 you a transcript --

5 A. Uh-huh.

6 Q. -- of your deposition?

7 A. Oh, okay.

8 Q. Can I do that?

9 A. Yeah.

10 MR. MESEREAU: May I approach?

11 THE COURT: Yes.

12 MR. ZONEN: What page, Counsel?

13 MR. MESEREAU: 208.

14 Q. Have you had a chance to look at that page?

15 A. No. Oh.

16 (Laughter.)

17 Q. You’ve had a chance to look at the page,

18 right?

19 A. Did I what?

20 Q. Have you had a chance to read that page

21 of your deposition?

22 A. Before today?

23 Q. No, no, today.

24 A. Oh, yeah.

25 Q. Okay. I just showed you the page, right?

26 A. Yeah.

27 Q. Have you had a chance to look at it?

28 A. Yeah. 5091



1 Q. And does it refresh your memory about what

2 Evangeline said to you?

3 A. You know, tell you the truth, I probably did

4 at that time. And I remember at the time, but this

5 time I don’t remember.

6 Q. Okay.

7 BAILIFF CORTEZ: Ma’am, speak into the mike.

8 THE WITNESS: Oops.

9 Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: Didn’t you tell Evangeline

10 that you were willing to talk to The Enquirer?

11 A. I don’t remember.

12 Q. Okay. Would it refresh your recollection

13 just to look at the page?

14 A. No.

15 Q. It wouldn’t? So even if you read the page,

16 it won’t help, do you think?

17 A. It won’t help me.

18 Q. Okay. Okay. But you don’t remember what

19 you said to Evangeline about talking to The

20 Enquirer?

21 A. I don’t even remember the whole sit -- I

22 don’t remember.

23 Q. Okay.

24 A. It was a lot -- at that time, you know, it

25 was --

26 Q. Evangeline called Hard Copy for you, right?

27 A. Uh-huh. Yeah, I think so.

28 Q. And she did it for you, right? 5092



1 A. Yeah, I think she did.

2 Q. You wanted her to find a way to communicate

3 with Hard Copy, right?

4 A. Yeah.

5 Q. Okay. And you wanted to talk to either Hard

6 Copy or The Enquirer, right?

7 A. I don’t remember if it was either of them,

8 but I remember that I say yeah.

9 Q. Okay. Okay.

10 A. Because I think they approach her first,

11 someone approach her. And she said, “Well, they

12 want to talk to you, too.” That’s what I got.

13 Q. Did you have an understanding with

14 Evangeline that if she arranged these interviews for

15 you, that you would pay her?

16 A. That I would pay her?

17 Q. Yes.

18 A. No.

19 Q. Did you believe she was just doing it as a

20 friend?

21 A. Yeah.

22 Q. Okay. So you didn’t have any arrangement

23 with her that you would split the money, right?

24 A. No.

25 Q. You gave her some money later on because you

26 appreciated what she had done for you, right?

27 A. Yeah. Yeah, because of the trouble that she

28 was going -- you know, she did, yeah. 5093



1 Q. Okay. So you gave her money as a friend,

2 right?

3 A. Yeah.

4 Q. Okay. There was no understanding before the

5 interview with her how much she would get?

6 A. No.

7 Q. Okay. Okay. Now, Evangeline told you that

8 she had reached Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, right; is

9 that right?

10 A. Yes.

11 Q. And Evangeline arranged for you to meet with

12 Diane Dimond, right?

13 A. Yes.

14 Q. How many meetings did you have with Diane

15 Dimond with Hard Copy?

16 A. I think it was just one.

17 Q. Do you remember going to the Hilton Hotel?

18 A. My -- yes.

19 Q. Is that where you saw Diane Dimond during a

20 meeting?

21 A. Yes.

22 Q. And that’s the meeting Evangeline went with

23 you to, right?

24 A. Yes.

25 Q. You told Diane Dimond during that interview

26 that you never told anyone that you had ever seen

27 Michael Jackson molesting boys, right?

28 A. Yes, I believe so. 5094



1 Q. And it was Evangeline that negotiated how

2 much money you were going to get, right?

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. You learned that you were going to get

5 $20,000 from Evangeline, right?

6 A. From Hard Copy.

7 Q. Yeah.

8 A. Not from Evangeline.

9 Q. Let me rephrase it to make sure you

10 understand.

11 A. Yeah.

12 Q. You learned from Evangeline that you were

13 going to get $20,000 for the interview with Hard

14 Copy, right?

15 A. Yeah.

16 Q. Is that correct?

17 A. Yes.

18 Q. Evangeline was supposed to speak to Hard

19 Copy about the money you were going to get, right?

20 A. Yes.

21 Q. So she was really your assistant, wasn’t

22 she?

23 A. Yeah.

24 Q. Okay. If you remember, how long was the

25 meeting at the Hilton Hotel with Diane Dimond?

26 A. About three hours, probably.

27 Q. Okay. Were there other people at that

28 meeting as well? 5095



1 A. I don’t remember. I don’t think so.

2 Q. Do you know if you were given a contract to

3 sign?

4 A. I signed it, but I don’t remember at what

5 time I did, if it was during that time or after the

6 interview.

7 Q. But you did sign the contract with Hard

8 Copy --

9 A. Yeah.

10 Q. -- right?

11 A. Yes.

12 Q. How did you get that contract?

13 A. How did I what?

14 Q. How did you get a copy of that contract?

15 A. I guess they give it to me.

16 Q. Okay. Did Miss Dimond give it to you

17 directly or did Evangeline give it to you?

18 A. No.

19 Q. Pardon me?

20 A. Miss Dimond gave it to me, I think.

21 Q. At the meeting?

22 A. I don’t remember. It was during the -- in

23 the room.

24 Q. Okay. And you were asked to sign that

25 contract in that room before you left, right?

26 A. Yeah, I guess so.

27 Q. Is that what you remember?

28 A. That’s what I remember. I don’t know. 5096



1 Q. Okay. Okay. The day after you were

2 interviewed by Hard Copy, Miss Dimond called you

3 again, right?

4 A. The day after?

5 Q. Yes. The day after your interview with Hard

6 Copy, Ms. Dimond called you again, right?

7 A. I don’t remember.

8 Q. Okay.

9 A. I don’t remember her calling me, but I don’t

10 remember if it was the next day or --

11 Q. Do you remember her wanting pictures of

12 Michael Jackson?

13 A. Yeah.

14 Q. Ms. Dimond wanted you to get her pictures of

15 Mr. Jackson, right?

16 A. I don’t remember.

17 Q. Do you remember that?

18 A. I think I give it to her, but I don’t

19 remember.

20 Q. Okay. Do you remember saying to Ms. Dimond

21 you don’t have pictures of Michael Jackson?

22 A. I don’t -- ask that --

23 Q. I’m sorry, I may not be explaining it

24 properly. Let me just rephrase the question. I’ll

25 withdraw the question.

26 A. Uh-huh.

27 Q. The day after you interviewed with Hard

28 Copy, Miss Dimond called you on the phone, right? 5097



1 A. I don’t remember.

2 Q. Well, after the interview with Hard Copy, do

3 you remember at some point in time Miss Dimond

4 called you?

5 A. I don’t remember.

6 Q. Okay. Do you remember Miss Dimond ever

7 asking you to get her pictures of Michael Jackson?

8 A. I don’t remember, but I give it to her

9 sometimes. Or one time, I guess, she got some

10 pictures of him.

11 Q. And was that part of your contract with the

12 show Hard Copy, that you would give them pictures?

13 A. Yeah -- yes.

14 Q. Okay. And when they paid you $20,000, was

15 part of what you had to do to give them pictures?

16 A. Yes. I guess.

17 Q. Do you remember sending any pictures of Mr.

18 Jackson’s animals to Hard Copy?

19 A. I think all the pictures I got, I give her,

20 it was me with animals, probably. But it was me

21 mostly. Not of animals.

22 Q. Did you send pictures of Mr. Jackson’s lion?

23 A. No.

24 Q. How about his tiger?

25 A. Not -- I was in the picture, but it wasn’t

26 by itself of the --

27 Q. Okay.

28 A. -- tiger. 5098

21 Q. Okay. And you could -- you didn’t think

22 people would notice your son on the show, right?

23 A. Yeah. Probably. Probably, yes.

24 Q. You said in the deposition you didn’t think

25 anybody would recognize who your son was on the Hard

26 Copy show, right?

27 A. Yeah. Probably I said that.

28 Q. That’s what you said, right? 5099

2 Q. Okay. Now, at some point, you called Diane

3 Dimond and she didn’t return your calls, right?
