26 asked questions about that while you were in front

27 of the Santa Barbara Grand Jury, correct?

12 inappropriately touching your brother, right ?

13 MR . SNEDDON : I’m going to object as vague

14 MR . SNEDDON : Since we’ve already seen it ,

18 think would be repetitive?

13 MR . SNEDDON : Yeah, that’s fine. Yeah , we

17 and then ask questions after it. The rebuttal video

18 I would be asking questions throughout it . Thank

19 you.

20 THE COURT : There’s no objection to it going

21 in evidence , then ?

22 MR . SNEDDON : No, Your Honor, there is not.

26 A. I never heard my family say that .

27 Q. Never heard anyone in your family say,

28 “Michael , would you please help us, our son is dying

1427

1 of cancer”?

2 A. Probably did. I wasn’t there .

3 Q. Okay. Well , it’s your understanding that

6 to talk to Michael Jackson , right?

7 A. Okay.

8 Q. Is that your understanding ?

9 A. Yeah.

7 know.

8 Q. To your knowledge , Michael Jackson spent a

9 lot of time with your brother at Neverland trying to

10 encourage him to beat cancer, right ?

11 MR . SNEDDON : Objection , Your Honor . Calls

12 for facts not in evidence; lack of foundation.

13 THE COURT : Overruled .

14 He ‘s asking your knowledge , if you know

15 that.

16 THE WITNESS : Michael was only there with

17 Gavin a couple times while he was at Neverland. He

18 wasn’t there the whole entire cancer.

19 Q. BY MR . MESEREAU: Okay. I didn’t ask you

20 that. Let me just ask the question again , because

23 THE COURT : Counsel, he answered your

24 question . Please ask another question .

25 MR . MESEREAU: Okay.

7 we ‘d like to play the rebuttal video, which is in

8 evidence .

9 THE COURT : All right .

10 MR . MESEREAU: Thank you.

11 MR . SANGER: For the record, that would be

12 Exhibit 340 and we’re going to start with Tape 1

13 of 2. Actually, it says Tape 1 of 2, but it would

14 be DVD 1 of 2.

15 THE BAILIFF : I’m not sure if that’s –

16 MR . SANGER: That ‘s on the film.

17 THE BAILIFF : Oh.

1430

4 like a father. He actually seemed more

5 fatherly -like than my biological father. He –

6 there is — I just — that was my first impression

7 of Michael,” you were really talking about Jay

8 Jackson?

9 A. Yes, sir .

10 Q. Why did you use the name “Michael”?

11 A. Well, because he told us to say good things

12 only about — because he told us only to say good

13 things about Michael .

14 Q. Okay. So you really were referring to Jay

15 Jackson?

16 A. Exactly.

17 Q. I see . Okay.

18 We can keep going through.

20 Exhibit 340 , Disk 1, was played for the Court and

21 jury.)

22 Q. BY MR . MESEREAU: Now, Star, when you heard

23 your mother make those comments about Michael

6 Q. Okay. We can keep going.

7 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD , People’s

8 Exhibit 340 , Disk 1, was played for the Court and

9 jury.)

10 Q. BY MR . MESEREAU: Now, you said — Davellin

11 says about Michael, “He gives Gavin advice,” and

12 then you say, “He helps me with homework,” right?

13 A. Okay.

14 Q. Was that the truth?

15 A. No . We didn’t even have homework.

16 Q. Was that a lie ?

17 A. Yes.

18 Q. We can keep going .

15 Q. “He helps us with basically anything we ask

16 and we love him.” You’re saying you weren’t telling

17 the truth?

19 because Dieter told us to.

20 Q. So everybody just memorized all these lines?

21 A. I just said whatever came to my head.

22 Q. Okay. Okay .

23 A. I was trying to get out of there . I was

Q. So you don’t think your mother was acting in

5 a spontaneous kind of way when she answered these

7 A. I don ‘t know. It was her emotions.

8 Q. Okay.

11 Q. Pardon me?

12 A. I don ‘t remember even hearing that.

13 Q. Okay.

14 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People ‘s

15 Exhibit 340 , Disk 1, was played for the Court and

16 jury.)

17 MR . SANGER: Your Honor , that ‘s — actually,

18 that does that , and that’s the end of this tape , so

19 I’m going to stop it , if that ‘s all right .

20 THE COURT : Yes .

21 Q. BY MR . MESEREAU: Star, you heard your

22 mother say all of her children want to be in movies.

17 right , Your Honor .

18 THE COURT : Okay.

19 (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People ‘s

20 Exhibit 340 , Disk 2, was played for the Court and

21 jury.)

22 Q. BY MR . MESEREAU: Star, do you know what

23 your mother is referring to when she mentioned “gang

24 signs “?

25 A. Probably the guy behind the camera was doing

26 something.

28 thought at the time?

1437

1 A. At that time?

2 Q. Yes.

3 A. No . I was just thinking about sleep.

4 Q. Did you think your mother was talking about

5 a cameraman making gang signs ? Is that what she was

6 saying?

7 A. She was pointing at off camera, so it

8 couldn’t be the cameraman. It had to be someone

9 else.

10 Q. Okay. Let me just get this straight. You

11 think she was talking about the cameraman –

12 A. No , I know she was talking about not the

13 cameraman, but someone off camera.

14 Q. Making gang signs ?

15 A. They probably weren’t even doing gang signs.

16 He was probably doing a signal or something. I

17 don’t know.

18 Q. But I think what you ‘re saying is you don ‘t

19 know what she was referring to, right?

20 A. No .

21 Q. Now, was it your — are you telling the jury

22 that while all this was going on , your family was

23 being falsely imprisoned?

24 MR . SNEDDON : Objection . Argumentative,

25 Your Honor. It’s a legal conclusion using those

26 words .

27 THE COURT : Sustained .

28 Q. BY MR . MESEREAU: Do you feel that while

1438

1 this was all going on, your family was not free to

2 leave ?

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. Okay. And do you think the way your mother

5 was acting, that she was in fear ?

6 A. I don ‘t know. I can ‘t speak for her.

7 Q. Were you in fear?

8 A. I was just sleepy .

9 Q. Okay. All right.

22 Exhibit 340 , Disk 2, was played for the Court and

24 Q. BY MR . MESEREAU: Star, the person who ‘s

25 doing the interview says, “Davellin , Star , when you

26 guys first went to the ranch, I’m sure you were

27 pretty down .”

28 When you first went to Neverland Ranch , were

1439

1 you pretty down?

2 A. The first ever time?

3 Q. Yes.

4 A. Yes.

10 Exhibit 340 , Disk 2, was played for the Court and

12 Q. BY MR . MESEREAU: Now, Star, when you made

13 that statement , were you telling the truth?

14 A. What was the statement?

15 Q. The statement was , “The first time before

16 our brother ever went to the ranch, he was always

17 sad, he was always crying, he was always just down

18 all the time. When he went to the ranch, he was

19 always happy. He was always playful. He was happy

20 again . He was cheerful , and it also gave him

21 something to look forward when we left .”

22 Was that a true statement?

23 A. It was kind of true, because my brother was

24 sad and — what’s the other word I used? Well, he

25 was sad and down, because he was going through a

26 life-threatening disease.

27 Q. And he was happy at the ranch , correct ?

28 A. Yes. In the beginning, yes.

1440

1 Q. Okay.

3 Exhibit 340 , Disk 2, was played for the Court and

4 jury.)

5 Q. BY MR . MESEREAU: At this point, Star,

6 you’re trying to speak out , correct ?

7 A. No . I was just saying I was sleepy .

8 Q. Well, he said he can hear you , Star , right?

9 A. Yeah. I was complaining.

10 Q. Was it your understanding that this film was

11 supposed to be on a television show ?

12 A. No .

13 Q. Did you ever learn that this film was

14 supposed to appear on FOX Television?

19 Exhibit 340 , Disk 2, was played for the Court and

20 jury.)

21 MR . MESEREAU: Your Honor, there ‘s a final

22 piece of evidence we ‘d like to use that the

23 prosecution wants to look at. It’s on DVD. It ‘s a

24 card on DVD , and I think — is it true you have

25 that?

26 MR . SNEDDON : No. You came up at the break

27 and asked me for something , and it’s locked up in

28 evidence at the sheriff ‘s department.

1441

1 MR . SANGER: Your Honor , we have it . I said

2 we ‘d show it to him. And we’re going to try to

3 use — we’re going to try to use the electronic

4 version, and then they’ll bring the actual piece of

5 evidence over later, and we can substitute that .

6 So with the Court ‘s indulgence, we need just

7 a minute for them to huddle over here, or somebody

8 to take a look at it , if that ‘s all right .

9 THE COURT : Go ahead.

10 MR . SNEDDON : Do you have it?

11 MR . SANGER: I have it right here. It ‘s on

12 the screen.

13 MR . SNEDDON : Oh, it ‘s on your computer.

14 MR . SANGER: Yeah .

15 (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel

16 table .)

17 MR . SNEDDON : Judge, I have no objection to

18 them using that in lieu of the original for right

19 now, and we ‘ll get the original over here , if not

20 today , tomorrow.

21 THE COURT : All right . We will give it a

22 number now. So it will be 5004. And we’ll mark the

23 original when you bring it over.

24 MR . SANGER: Your Honor , I believe there are

25 three cards , if I’m not mistaken . But we can mark

26 them as a group as 5004 . We don ‘t have to give them

27 separate numbers, unless the Court wants to.

28 THE COURT : Okay. Well, let’s mark them,

1442

1 three cards , as a group , numbered 5004 .

2 MR . SANGER: May I walk around here ? I have

3 to hook the thing up to the screen. Is that all

4 right , Your Honor ?

5 THE COURT : Yes .

6 THE BAILIFF : It will be “Input 1.”

7 THE COURT : “Input 1,” okay .

9 the “PC” button?

10 THE COURT : These are agreed they go in

11 evidence ? No objection to them going into evidence?

12 MR . SNEDDON : No, none whatsoever, Your

13 Honor .

14 THE COURT : All right . They’re admitted.

15 5004 is admitted.

16 MR . MESEREAU: Thank you, Your Honor.

21 cards from time to time ?

22 A. Your microphone’s not on.

23 Q. Excuse me? You’re right.

24 THE COURT : They’re having trouble hearing

25 you.

26 MR . MESEREAU: You’re right.

27 Q. You have sent greeting cards from time to

28 time to people whom you asked for money, true?

1443

1 MR . SNEDDON : Object ; assumes facts not in

2 evidence .

3 THE COURT : Sustained .

4 Q. BY MR . MESEREAU: The language that you hear

5 on that rebuttal tape is language similar to

6 language you have used in greeting cards to people

7 you were seeking money from, right?

8 A. We were never seeking –

9 MR . SNEDDON : Object , Your Honor . I object.

6 MR . SANGER: May as well.

7 THE COURT: That’s “4.”

8 (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel

9 table .)

10 MR . SNEDDON : I have a suggestion.

11 THE COURT : Yes .

12 MR . SNEDDON : Since he’s only asking him to

13 refresh his recollection, just take the computer and

14 show it to him .

15 MR . MESEREAU: We ‘ve moved it into evidence,

16 Your Honor. I’d like the jury to see it, if we can.

28 coming down in one second.

1445

16 technician….

17 (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel

1457

1 we go .

2 Q. All right. Star, you indicated to Mr.

25 Q. So you counted each one of those things as a

26 lock?

28 Q. Okay. And what else was locked, do you

1458

1 consider a lock?

6 Q. And where was the key pad that unlocked it?

7 Back over there that you showed us on that other

8 photograph?

9 A. Yes. And there’s a lock that you just

10 twist , and there’s one more lock . Wait. Wait, I

11 think there ‘s just six, then.

13 considered the locks that you were talking about

28 Q. Now, with regard to your testimony and the

1459

2 and today, do you see the door that you were

3 referring to that leads to Mr . Jackson ‘s bedroom?

4 A. Yes.

5 Q. All right. Can you point that out to the

6 jury?

7 A. Yes.

16 that you come into the entryway?

17 A. No .

18 Q. Pardon?

19 A. Well, yes, it’s different. It’s a single

20 door.

21 Q. And when you referred to a door the first

22 time that you went up the stairs that was — that

23 you thought was locked until you pushed it the

24 second time , is that the door you’re referring to?

25 A. Yes.

26 Q. Now, Star, you can put that down if you’d

27 like.

28 And we can turn the lights on , if you’d

4 A. Yes.

5 Q. Did you need to have a combination to get in

23 right , so I cooked some stuff .

24 Q. Do you like to cook?

25 A. Yes.

26 Q. Is that one of your hobbies?

27 A. One of my hobbies , yes.

28 Q. One other thing, just — when you answered

16 up there with our ATV’s and we saw a trail, and so

17 we went up there, and we found like a glass table

18 and — it was like a covered area. And there was a

19 telescope that was mounted right there .

20 Q. All right. I’m going to ask you some

21 questions now about some things that Mr. Mesereau

22 asked you about. Okay?

23 A. Okay.

24 Q. Now, do you remember Mr . Mesereau asking you

25 about the incident that you described where Mr.

24 was, like, kind of funny. So she wanted me to go to

25 this comedy camp that was at a comedy club, and it

26 was called Laugh Factory.

27 And so I went there, and we would — Jamie

28 would have comedians come, and then we would — they

1482

1 would teach us and we would take notes and stuff.

2 And then , like , toward the end — well , when we have

3 our graduation from comedy camp, we each had like

4 a — like our own coach for each people — for each

5 person, and my coach was George Lopez.

6 Q. Now, you used the name “Jamie .” Do you know

7 Jamie ‘s last name ?

8 A. Masada.

9 Q. And did he become a family friend?

10 A. Yeah. He’s really close. Like when I had

11 cancer, he would always visit me . And he would feed

12 me food, because I didn ‘t really want to eat ,

13 because the chemotherapy makes you always nauseous

14 and always want to throw up. And it got to the

15 point where I got to , like , 68 pounds. And Jamie

16 would feed me pineapple and melon and stuff.

17 Q. Now, when you were at the comedy camp that

18 summer – okay? – did you have somebody that you

19 admired as a comedian?

20 A. Uh -huh.

21 Q. Who was that?

26 Q. Who? Just tell me who first.

27 A. Jamie .

28 Q. Okay. Go ahead.

1483

1 A. At the comedy camp, I would always ask Jamie

2 if Jay Leno was ever going to come, if Jay Leno ‘s

3 going to come and teach us , come to the camp ,

4 because I really liked him . Jay Leno was my

5 favorite comedian . But he never came to the camp.

6 Q. At some point in time, you learned — you

7 became ill, correct?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. And when you became ill , what was the first

10 thing that you realized that something wasn’t right

11 with your body ?

12 A. Well, my stomach was hurting a lot, like it

13 felt like there was a knife in your stomach. And I

14 couldn’t sleep at night . I would put my pillow in

15 my stomach, because it really hurt. And then I

16 looked at myself in the mirror and lifted up my

17 shirt , and I saw there was a big bump, like my lower

18 left torso.

19 Q. Okay.

20 A. And my grandmother came , and she saw it, and

21 she told my parents. And a couple days later we

22 went to the hospital , and they told me — the

23 doctors were saying, like, it ‘s an inflamed spleen

24 or it ‘s this and that. They weren’t really saying

25 it was cancer yet .

26 Q. When you went to the hospital for the first

27 time and they examined you , did they put you in the

28 hospital on that date?

1484

1 A. Yeah. And then I had a surgery that same

2 week on Thursday. So we went there on Monday, I

3 think , and then surgery was on Thursday.

4 Q. When did you personally learn that you had

5 cancer?

6 A. Um , it was before my surgery. They were

7 very open. They would — didn’t try to hide it from

8 me that I had cancer . The surgeons came in and they

9 talked about it, and they said what the cancer was .

10 And they said how they were going to take it out,

11 and they were going to need to take out this –

12 they’re going to need to remove the cancer. And

13 then Thursday they did the surgery. And they had –

14 they didn’t just have to take out the cancer , they

15 had to take out my spleen and my left kidney ,

16 because the cancer was eating away at the — my

17 spleen and my kidney .

18 Q. Now, after you came out of surgery, and

19 you — did you remain in the hospital for some

20 period of time ?

21 A. Yes.

22 Q. How long ; do you remember?

23 A. A few weeks , I guess .

24 Q. During that first period of time after the

25 surgery and you were there for two weeks, did you

26 have any visitors ?

27 A. Yeah.

28 Q. Who was that?

1485

1 A. Like my old coach , George Lopez, came, and

2 he would always — he visited me . Jamie would visit

3 me . And then Louise Palanker would visit me . My

4 grandparents would visit me a lot. George Lopez

5 would always bring me shirts and stuff , because a

6 lot of my clothes didn’t fit me anymore. And Jamie

7 would buy me these little toys that I could play

8 with.

9 Jamie would always say like — I remember

10 hearing him say to my parents actually , to “Always

11 keep him happy . Always keep him happy .”

12 Q. Now, did you become friends with George

13 Lopez ?

14 A. Oh , yeah . He was like a brother to me . He

15 was very close and caring about everything that

16 happened with my cancer .

17 Q. Are you still close to Mr. Lopez ?

18 A. No . Not really.

19 Q. What happened?

20 A. Well, I heard about something that happened

21 between my biological father and George Lopez.

22 There was a confrontation where he went to one of

23 his clubs — not one of his clubs. One of his shows

24 at a club, and –

25 Q. Between your — between who?

26 A. My biological father David and George.

27 Q. After that, did you have any contact with

28 Mr . Lopez?

1486

1 A. No .

2 Q. Was that after your cancer had gone into

3 remission?

4 A. Yes, I believe so .

5 Q. So Mr . Lopez was there for you during the

6 time you were having cancer?

7 A. Yeah, he was always there for me . He would

8 always call and talk to me , call me and say that to

9 “Always” — that “Always be happy.” He’d cheer me

10 up when I was sad and stuff.

11 Q. Now, during the time that you were in the

12 hospital with cancer , did you ever have a

13 conversation with regard to some people that you

14 would like to meet?

15 A. Yeah.

16 Q. Now, at the time that you asked — you made

17 the request to meet these people , what was your

18 condition at that point in time in terms of whether

19 you thought you were going to live or die ?

20 A. Well, me , when I had cancer, I never thought

21 I was going to die. I always — I never even

22 thought about that. I always thought about, oh ,

23 getting done with the chemo and going to school

24 again ; you know what I mean?

25 Q. Did the doctors tell you something

26 different?

27 A. Yeah, there was one time that I was — well,

28 they thought I was sleeping in my bed, and they were

1487

1 talking to my mother and my biological father. And

2 my doctor told them to prepare for my funeral. And

3 that if the cancer didn ‘t kill me, the chemotherapy

4 would . Because the chemotherapy is toxic and they

5 were giving me adult dosages.

6 Q. So who did you make the request of to meet

7 some people while you were under going cancer

8 treatment?

9 A. Jamie .

10 Q. And who did you ask to see ?

11 A. Well, there ‘s — I asked — like every time

12 I would watch Jay Leno’s shows was — Jay Leno was a

13 really nice , really nice comedian, and I always

14 wanted to meet him. And he was like — I thought he

15 was like the coolest comedian .

16 And then Louise Palanker and Jamie Masada

17 knew that, and so they gave me his phone number .

18 And I would call him up , and I would ask him if he

19 could come and visit me or he could give me his

20 phone number so I could call him , and I would leave

21 messages .

22 Q. Anybody else other than Mr . Leno ?

23 A. Michael.

24 Q. Okay. Anybody else?

25 A. Chris Tucker.

26 Q. Okay. Were there any others? Were there

27 others that you asked to meet but you didn’t meet?

28 A. Oh , that I didn’t meet? No, I don’t think

1488

1 so .

2 Q. Okay. Tell me about Mr . Tucker. How was it

3 that you met Mr. Tucker ?

4 A. He came to my first benefit that Jamie

5 allowed me to have. And he was sitting there and

6 talking to me, and he was talking to me about God

7 and stuff, and that God ‘s going to bless me and all

8 this stuff like that . And then he wrote his phone

9 number down on a napkin . He told me to call him and

10 that we would hang out sometime.

11 And then so — the next day I called him

12 because I was — because it was Chris Tucker and he

13 was really cool.

14 Q. Okay. Did he come over ?

15 A. I went over to his house.

16 Q. How did you get there?

17 A. I think my dad drove me over the first time.

18 Q. So you met Mr. Tucker at his house, the

19 first time you met him in person ?

20 A. Yeah. No, I met him in person the first

21 time at the benefit. Like he was there. He was –

22 he was wearing like this white hat and white shirt .

23 Q. During the time that you had cancer , did you

24 become close friends with Mr. Tucker?

25 A. Yeah. He is –

26 Q. Tell us what Mr. Tucker did to help you.

27 A. He was really close to me. Like , he would

28 always — like , he took us to the Nickelodeon Awards

1489

1 like two years in a row . And he said, “Well , this

2 is our tradition. We’re always going to go to the

3 Nickelodeon Awards.” And he got really — like , we

4 were really close .

5 And, like, one night , on New Year’s, I was

6 feeling really sad because I had to be in the

7 hospital , and I was watching the New Year ‘s stuff.

8 And so I called up Chris, and I asked him ,

9 “Hey” — I actually — I just left a message . I

10 didn’t really talk to him in person . I said ,

11 “Chris, man , I need my brother. I don ‘t really have

12 anybody here.”

13 And then he didn’t even — he didn’t call me

14 back. But like at twelve o’clock midnight, he was

15 at my hospital — well, actually , he was in the

16 elevator coming up to my hospital room as New Year ‘s

17 rang out . And then he came up there, and we were

18 like — I was all , “Oh, Chris .” And he brought Aja,

19 his girlfriend , and little Dustin, his baby. And

20 then I didn ‘t think they were going to come because

21 New Year ‘s already rang out and stuff. Like , ten –

22 seven — five seconds after New Year’s, he was in my

23 hospital room. And I was really happy , and — I

24 don’t know. And he said, “Well, it ‘s not about

25 looking at when it rings out. It’s about being with

26 the people you love.” And that’s one of the reasons

27 I really like Chris and I got close to Chris .

28 Q. Did Mr. Tucker take you any other places?

1490

1 A. Yeah, he took me to Neverland a couple of

2 times . He took me out there.

3 Q. All right. Any other places that you recall

4 going with Mr. Tucker?

5 A. Oakland.

6 Q. Oakland?

7 A. Yeah. To see –

8 Q. What was the occasion?

9 A. Oh , because he knew I liked the Raiders

10 football team, so he — he knew this guy, he knew

11 one guy on the football team. I don’t know his

12 first name, but his last name is Pope. And he took

13 me up there in his plane, and then we went and saw

14 an Oakland Raider game. And I remember the Raiders

15 played the Jets. And then the Raiders won that

16 game. And we went into the locker room afterwards .

17 I met a bunch of players and he signed a jersey that

18 I had . So it was pretty cool .

19 Q. Did you ever go to any Laker games with him?

20 A. Yeah.

21 Q. Tell us about that.

22 A. Like, he had these — like , these pretty

23 rich friends, and he would take me to — over there,

24 and he would always have, like, front-row seats to

25 the Laker games, and they would take me.

26 And then , like , Chris — one time Chris

27 bought me a jersey, and we would always have

28 those — like, I remember seeing — always go right

1491

1 when we come in, and it was the front-row seats so

2 you could see the line of the court . It was pretty

3 cool.

4 Q. Did you ever go in the locker room?

5 A. No . We went — it wasn ‘t really a locker

6 room we went to. It was like — kind of like a

7 garage place, and then we saw , like , all the

8 players. They were already like dressed, leaving.

9 And then I saw Shaq. Like , his whole — it was

10 like my head came barely past his waist.

11 Q. Big guy, huh?

12 A. Yeah.

13 Q. Are you friends with Mr . Tucker anymore

14 currently?

15 A. Well, I don ‘t know if he still wants to be

16 my friend, but I’m — no, I haven’t called him in a

17 while . And he hasn’t — he hasn ‘t called me and we

18 haven ‘t really talked in a while .

19 Q. Why?

20 A. I don ‘t know. I guess because of all this

21 stuff .

22 Q. Now, you told the ladies and gentlemen of

23 the jury that you had gone to a benefit. I think

24 that’s what you said . A benefit ?

25 A. Uh -huh.

26 Q. At The Laugh Factory ?

27 A. Yeah. Jamie donated one of his nights to –

28 for me. I think it was like Thursday or something .

1492

1 Q. And was that a different night or the same

2 night that you met Mr. Tucker for the first time?

3 A. I think that was the — the first night I

4 met him was — oh , actually, when I met Chris

5 Tucker, I met him at a graduation for the 2000 class

6 of comedy camp . Like, Jamie invited me over there

7 for that , and Chris Tucker was there. That wasn’t

8 when the benefit was . I just remembered that right

9 now. It was then .

10 Q. But did you meet him at a benefit?

11 A. I met Chris at the graduation for, like,

12 2000 comedy camp.

13 Q. All right. Do you know whether Mr. Tucker

14 ever attended any of the benefits that Mr . Masada

15 arranged ?

16 A. Yeah, he came to my first benefit.

17 Q. Now, were you at the benefit?

18 A. Yes. I performed in it .

19 Q. Well, who else was there, from your family?

20 A. I had my doctor, my — Chris and his — all

21 his friends . And Kobe was there . And he brought

22 his girlfriend or his now wife. I don ‘t know,

23 some — it was a lady. Louise Palanker was there.

24 A lot of people came , so….

25 Q. And members of your family . Who was there?

26 A. My mom was there, and my biological father.

27 Oh , I don’t know if my mom was there. My biological

28 father was there, I think.

1493

1 Q. Any of your brothers or sisters?

2 A. I’m pretty sure they were there.

3 Q. Now, did you have occasion on that

4 particular night to meet Kobe Bryant?

5 A. No . The first time I really met — I met

6 Kobe Bryant was at one of the Laker games that Chris

7 brought me. And they were all talking , like , in

8 this hallway. It was — I don’t know, it was

9 like — it was like a really long hallway . It was

10 all cement.

11 And then Chris and, like, all these other

12 guys were talking to Kobe and they were all leaning

13 against the wall and they were all talking, and I

14 was just sitting there because I was bored. They

15 were all talking about, like, adult stuff .

16 Q. Did you ever have a picture taken with Mr .

17 Bryant?

18 A. Yeah.

19 Q. Where was that picture taken at?

20 A. That was at my first benefit.

21 Q. At where ?

22 A. At The Laugh Factory .

23 Q. Now, at any of these benefits — there were

24 two benefits; is that correct ?

25 A. Yes.

26 Q. I don ‘t want to put words in your mouth.

27 Were there more than two, or is that –

28 A. No , I’m pretty sure there was only two .

1494

1 Q. And where was the second benefit ?

2 A. At The Laugh Factory .

3 Q. And do you remember how much time elapsed

4 between the first benefit and the second benefit?

5 A. Probably a month maybe.

6 Q. At the first benefit — or at the second

7 benefit — let ‘s just go to the second benefit for a

8 second. Just tell me what members of your family

9 were at that benefit .

10 A. I don ‘t know. Maybe — I guess my dad would

11 be there .

12 Q. Why?

13 A. Because he was the one that was always with

14 me .

15 Q. At either of these benefits, did you ever

16 hear your mother ask for any money?

17 A. No .

18 Q. Did you ever hear your father ask for any

19 money at these benefits ?

20 A. I wouldn ‘t really see him asking for money,

21 but I knew he would be the one getting the money.

22 Q. How do you know that ?

23 A. Because he would be the one talking to Jamie

24 about that stuff.

25 Q. During the time that you had cancer , was it

26 necessary for the members of your family to do

27 something to — with regard to where you stayed when

28 you were not in the hospital?

1495

1 A. Yeah.

2 Q. What was that?

3 A. Well, they didn’t want me to stay at the

4 apartment anymore . And they wanted to also make me

5 happy , and they knew I loved my grandma, so they had

6 me go live with my grandma .

7 But the problem was, I couldn ‘t go to my

8 grandma’s house, because they didn’t have a room

9 that I could stay in that was clean , because I had

10 to stay in a clean room .

11 So Louise Palanker gave us some money so

12 that we could fix up a room at my grandma ‘s house.

13 And they gave us money so I could get, like, a –

14 linoleum tile floors , and — because I couldn’t have

15 carpe t because it would be too dust y and bacteria

16 could be there . And I didn’t have a spleen, and I

17 had, like, no white blood cells, so I could get

18 sick, really sick , and get fevers and have to go to

19 the hospital and stuff. That ‘s why they had to put

20 down linoleum floors . And then they painted the

21 rooms all, like, this green color. And then they

22 painted white because it was a different color.

23 They got me a better bed and then they also found me

24 a T.V. in my room .

25 Q. Do you remember, how big was the T.V.?

26 A. It was probably about that big (indicating).

27 Q. Okay. I’m a bad judge of distance there.

28 About three feet?

1496

1 A. I don ‘t know.

2 MR . SNEDDON : Counsel, three feet?

3 Q. Depending whether they’re Shaq’s or not, I

4 guess , huh?

25 right of Louise Palanker. And then that’s me.

26 Q. And do you recall when that photograph was

27 taken ?

28 A. That was during our camp at Laugh Factory .

1497

1 Q. Do you know where the money came from to fix

2 up your room?

3 A. I think it came from Louise.

4 Q. Did you have a nickname you used to call

5 her?

8 over. And I think the next one is 199 ; is that

19 then at The Laugh Factory.

20 Q. Okay. Why don ‘t we turn over — let’s go to

21 the next photograph, if we could . Do you recognize

12 some contact with the defendant in this case , Mr.

13 Jackson?

14 A. Yes.

15 Q. Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of

16 the jury how that happened ?

17 A. I’m not sure who exactly got Michael to call

18 me . But he — one night — it was either Jamie or

19 this lady named Carol Lamir. One day when I was in

20 the hospital, Michael called me up — well, someone

21 called me up, and I was like, “Who is this?”

22 Q. Lean into the microphone, please .

23 A. Someone called me in my hospital room, and I

24 asked who was this? And then they said they were

25 Michael Jackson.
26 Q. And did you believe them?
27 A. Well, yeah.
28 Q. And how long did the conversation last ?

1499

1 A. That was a pretty short conversation. It

2 was only about , like , five minutes long.

3 Q. Now, did you have other conversations with

4 Mr . Jackson ?

5 A. Yeah.

6 Q. How many do you think you had — let me ask

7 you this . Let ‘s do it this way: At some point in

8 time, were you invited to go to Mr. Jackson’s ranch

9 at Neverland Valley Ranch?

10 A. Yeah.

11 Q. Between the time you received the first

12 telephone call from the person identifying

13 themselves as Michael Jackson until you went to the

14 ranch , how many calls did you think you had between

15 you and Mr. Jackson?

16 A. That was — there was only one call , because

17 the first time that he called me , he invited me up

18 to the ranch, said he wanted me to come down .

19 Q. Were you undergoing chemotherapy at this

20 time?

21 A. Yes, I was in the middle of a round of

22 chemotherapy.

23 Q. During this conversation with Mr . Jackson ,

24 was a date set for you folks to go there, or how was

25 it that the date was set for you to go ?

26 A. He just said that he wanted me to come down.

27 And then I’m not sure how it got set up, but he was

28 telling me like — about, like, my cancer , and

1500

1 talked to me about — that he wanted me to go to his

2 ranch and stuff like that.

3 I don ‘t know how it got set up to go up

4 there . I think they talked to my parents or

5 something.

6 Q. During the time that you had cancer , did you

7 have other telephone calls with Mr. Jackson?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. Could you give us an estimate of how many

10 calls that you had from him?

11 A. I don ‘t know. Like 20 maybe. 20 calls.

12 Q. Were some of them quite lengthy?

13 A. Yeah.

14 Q. Were they all in the hospital ?

15 A. No .

16 Q. Where were you when you had other calls with

17 Mr . Jackson ?

18 A. My grandma’s house.

19 Q. Now, you said that you were invited by Mr .

20 Jackson to go up to his ranch ?

21 A. Uh -huh.

22 Q. And had you ever heard of Mr. Jackson’s

23 ranch prior to that?

24 A. No . After when he, like, called me and said

25 “ranch,” I thought it was like a ranch with horses .

26 Q. So how did you get up to the ranch?

27 A. There was a limousine that came to my

28 grandma’s house and then we went up in a limousine .

1501

1 Q. And who went up there?

2 A. It was me, my mom , my biological father, my

3 sister, my brother and me.

4 Q. And do you remember about — like, was it

5 daylight or was it dark when you got there?

6 A. It was daylight.

7 Q. And do you remember what happened when you

8 first got there?

9 A. Um , yeah , I think — I guess they told

10 Michael we were up there already . And he had a bib

11 on , because he was eating. And then he ran out and

12 he greeted us and he had, like, a red shirt on, a

13 black tie.

14 Q. All right. Did you have any conversation

15 with Mr. Jackson at that time , during the greetings?

16 A. Well, he just said hi to us, because he had

17 to go do something.

18 Q. So where did you go after Mr. Jackson went

19 to do something?

20 A. I think we ate .

21 Q. All right.

22 A. I guess.

23 Q. What did you do after that ?

24 A. We went and saw the unit that he put us in.

25 And then they were afraid — like, my dad was kind

26 of afraid of putting me on rides , because he thought

27 maybe , because of my surgery, I might, like, rupture

28 something or whatever. And then — but I eventually

1502

1 talked him into letting me go on rides , and we

2 started going on rides and stuff .

3 Q. At the amusement park?

4 A. Yeah, at the ranch.

5 Q. Now, let ‘s go back just a moment . Okay?

6 You said that you were placed in some room somewhere

7 to stay. Where — where were those located in

8 relationship to the main residence?

9 A. They were like 50 , 100 yards away from the

10 main house, and that ‘s where they put, like, all our

11 bags and stuff .

12 Q. All the what?

13 A. All our bags. All in the place where we

14 were staying. They put all our bags in those rooms.

15 Q. The room that you stayed in, who stayed in

16 that room with you?

17 A. Well, the first night I didn’t really stay

18 in that room. But the person that was supposed to

19 stay in that room was me and my brother.

20 Q. And where was your mother and your sister ?

21 A. My mother, my sister stood in the guest –

22 a queen-sized room or something. No, I think me, my

23 brother, and my sister was going to stay in one

24 room, and then my mom and my biological father were

25 going to stay in another.

26 Q. Do you remember any incident while you were

27 at Neverland Ranch on this first visit involving

28 your mother and your father?

1503

1 A. Yeah.

2 Q. What happened?

3 A. They kind of got in a fight again, and my

4 mom had makeup on and my dad made fun of her and

5 said she looked like a clown, and then my dad got a

6 cup of soda and threw it in her face.

7 Q. Now, after you got to Neverland Ranch,

8 before we go to the next day or to that night, did

9 you ever ride any of the carts, the motorized carts

10 there ?

11 A. Yeah.

12 Q. Tell us about that.

13 A. Well, I couldn ‘t really ride one yet because

14 Michael said, like, I had to go through his driving

15 test to see if I could drive the carts . And then I

16 could drive them. So –

17 Q. What did the test amount to?

18 A. Just make sure I wouldn ‘t crash it; I knew

19 how to, like, drive it and not run into things.

22 like, wanted to sleep in his room, too . And then he

23 told us to ask in front of our parents if we could

24 sleep in his room .

26 mean, he wasn’t typing. Frank was typing .

27 Q. So how long do you think — how many

28 different sites do you think you went to?

1506

1 A. Maybe , like , seven sites. We didn’t go to

8 stuff , and Michael was like, “Got milk ?” And we

9 started laughing because he said that.

10 Q. Okay. Did he say anything else?

11 A. Like, Paris and Prince were sleeping in his

21 me . Like, he would call all the kids that came to

22 his ranch that . It was either like “Doo-Doo Head”

23 or “Apple Head .”

24 Q. So he would call you either one of those two

8 Q. Yes, between that and Miami.

9 A. Okay.

11 there a time when you went back to the ranch with

12 Chris Tucker?

13 A. Yes.

14 Q. Okay. So let’s just use that as a point in

15 time. All right?

16 A. Okay.

17 Q. From the time you went there for the very

18 first time with your whole family, when Mr. Jackson

20 Tucker – okay? – for the first time ?

21 A. Okay.

22 Q. How many times had you visited the ranch?

23 A. Maybe , like , seven times probably.

26 the first time ?

27 A. No .

28 Q. How about your sister?

4 wheelchair –

5 A. Uh -huh.

6 Q. – did anybody tell you why they were doing

7 that?

8 A. No . Michael just said he wanted to make a

9 video and keep it , of me and him .

10 Q. During the time from when — the first time

11 you went to the ranch that you’ve described to us to

12 the time that you went there with Mr. Tucker -

13 okay? – during that, I think you said seven times,

14 how many of those times was Mr. Jackson actually

15 present on the ranch ?

16 A. Maybe twice .

17 Q. And on those occasions when Mr. Jackson was

18 on the ranch, did you have any contact with him ?

19 A. Those two occasions, yeah. But, I mean,

20 like, sometimes I would go up to the ranch and he

21 would say that he ‘s not there , and then he would be

22 there .

23 Q. What do you mean by that?

24 A. Like, when I would have cancer. I don ‘t

25 know what happened, but Michael, like, kind of

26 stopped talking to me and stuff, right in the middle

27 of my cancer.

28 And, like, I would go up there, and I would

1511

1 see, like, Prince and Paris playing there , and I

2 would think that Michael was there, and they would

3 tell me that Michael wasn’t there. And then , like ,

4 I would see him somewhere, and — I don’t know.

5 Q. Was there one occasion when you actually ran

6 into him by accident ?

7 A. Yeah.

8 Q. Tell the jury about that.

9 A. Well, I was playing with Prince and Paris

10 outside, like in the back of the house near where

11 the arcade was . And then we were walking into

12 the — into the main house . And I knew the code,

13 because they would give me the codes. And then I

14 walked in the door with Prince in my hand and Paris

15 in my other hand, and — we were holding hands. And

16 then we walked into the house and there I saw

17 Michael walking, like, toward me . But I guess he

18 didn’t see me turn the corner . And then he acted as

19 if , “Oh, crap,” you know what I mean? Like, he saw

20 me . And then — then he just played it off and ,

21 like, acted like, “Oh, hi, Doo-Doo Head.” You know,

22 at the time I — I was kind of hypnotized and, like,

23 he ‘s my –

25 narrative and non responsive.

26 THE COURT : Sustained .

27 Q. BY MR . SNEDDON : Okay.

28 A. And then , like –

1512

1 Q. That’s all right. I’ll give you a question.

2 So in any case , you bumped into him ?

3 A. Yeah. And I was — because of –

14 okay? – how long did that last? Just — how long

15 was the conversation between the two of you?

17 time we bumped into each other, and then we just

18 talked about — and stuff, and he said he had to go

19 somewhere.

20 Q. Now, you mentioned that you — well , let me

21 ask you this: Did you ever have a phone number for

22 Mr . Jackson ?

23 A. Yeah. He gave me a lot of phone numbers.

24 Q. I couldn ‘t hear you.

25 A. Yes.

26 Q. And how did you get those phone numbers?

27 A. Michael would give them to me , or Frank

28 would sometimes.

1513

1 Q. And when did you get those phone numbers?

2 A. Toward the beginning .

3 Q. Beginning of what ?

4 A. Like, the beginning of my cancer . First or

5 second time we went up to the ranch .

6 Q. Was there a certain point in time when those

7 phone numbers weren’t working anymore?

8 A. Yeah. Like –

9 Q. Do you remember how long it was into your

10 cancer when those phone numbers were no longer good?

11 A. Maybe , like , halfway through. Like , it

12 seemed like he changed all his numbers , or the

13 numbers that I called, he wouldn ‘t pick up. And –

14 or , like , Frank’s cell phone wasn’t — he wouldn’t

15 pick up. Frank wouldn’t pick up his phone either.

16 And –

17 Q. Now, you told the ladies and gentlemen of

26 A. Me , my now dad Jay, and I think my mom went,

27 and my brother and my sister, and they had his

1514

1 Q. Were there other times that you spent on the

8 A. I don ‘t know. It was just a day thing . We

9 went up there for one day and then we came back .

12 came back home .

13 Q. Were there other occasions when you were up

14 there with Mr. Tucker?

15 A. Yeah, one other time .

16 Q. And how long did you stay on that occasion?

18 week or — maybe a week and a half, something like

19 that.

20 Q. Was Mr. Jackson there on the day of Mr .

21 Tucker’s son’s birthday ?

22 A. No .

25 A. With Chris?

26 Q. Yes.

27 A. He was there, like, for a few days. That

28 was when — I believe that was when the Martin

1515

1 Bashir thing happened.

2 Q. I’m sorry?

3 A. I believe that was when the Martin Bashir

4 thing happened .

5 Q. Okay. Let’s talk a little bit about Martin

6 Bashir.

7 Were you introduced to a person by the name

8 of Martin Bashir?

9 A. Yes.

10 Q. And where were you introduced to the person

11 by the name of Martin Bashir?

12 A. In Michael’s living room, in his main house.

13 Q. And who introduced you to Mr. Bashir?

14 A. Michael.

15 Q. Now, how did you get to the ranch?

16 A. Um , I think Chris drove me up that time.

17 And then — in his bus.

18 Q. And did any other members of your family go

19 with you ?

20 A. It was only me , my sister and my brother.

21 Q. And did you know why you were going to the

22 ranch ?

23 A. Michael wanted me to go up there , and then I

24 think I called Chris . Because I would always tell

25 him that we never went up there, like together.

26 We ‘d never been at the ranch together with Chris.

27 He would go up there one time , and I would be at

28 home. And then I would go up , and he would be home.

1516

1 So we said that we’d all go there together. So we

2 all went up there , and Chris took us up there.

3 Q. Do you — when you got there — let me go

4 back in point in time.

5 Did you have a conversation with Mr . Jackson

6 before you went up to the ranch for the Bashir

7 thing – meaning Mr. Bashir – within , let’s say, days

8 of that?

9 A. Michael told me that he wanted me to go up

10 to the ranch, but — that’s when he wanted me to go

11 with — well, that’s when it was set up with Chris ,

12 but I mean before that, I didn’t talk to him in a

13 very, very long time .

14 Q. So when you said Mr. Jackson told you he

15 wanted you to go up to the ranch , how did that

16 communication occur between you and Mr . Jackson ?

17 A. I don ‘t know. He called my house. And he

18 kind of said he was trying to find me or something .

19 Q. All right. So you go up to the ranch and

20 you meet Mr . Bashir. When you got to the ranch ,

21 what was the first thing that happened ?

22 A. Well, he put our bags away . And then I

23 had — and I went into the main house. And –

24 Michael took me to the main house.

25 Q. Who did?

26 A. Michael.

27 Q. The defendant?

28 A. Yes.

1517

1 Q. Okay.

3 Q. All right. What happened then?

4 A. He told me –

5 Q. Who’s “he”?

6 A. No , actually, I don’t think that ‘s the first

7 thing that happened. I think — he started talking

8 to me about what was going to happen and stuff.

9 Like, he was pointing — he was telling me about

10 another young man that was a burn victim. And he

11 was telling me about how he helped him or whatever .

12 Q. Who’s this? Who’s the “he “?

13 A. I don ‘t know.

14 Q. No , who was talking to you ?

15 A. Michael.

16 Q. Okay.

17 A. And then –

18 Q. Where were you when you had this

19 conversation?

20 A. I think we were driving in one of the carts.

21 And then he was telling me that he was filming

22 something or something like that .

23 Q. All right. Did — did you at some point go

24 inside?

25 A. Yeah.

26 Q. Did you have any other conversations with

27 Mr . Jackson ?

28 A. Yeah, that’s when he introduced me to Martin

1518

1 Bashir.

2 Q. Any other conversation with Mr. Jackson?

3 A. Yeah. Like , he introduced me to Martin

4 Bashir, and then he took me — I think it was in the

5 library where he took me. And then he was telling

6 me , “Hey , you want to be an actor, right? And I was

7 like, “Yeah . I want to be comedian though.” And

8 then he was like, “But you can act too , right?” And

9 then I was like, “Yeah.”

10 “Well , I’m going to put you in the movies .

11 And this is your audition. Okay ?”

12 And I was like , “Oh, all right.”

13 And he told me , “Okay. I want you to go in

14 and then tell them about how I helped you .” And he

15 told me to, like, make sure — tell them about,

16 like, this and that, and about “that you call me

17 dad,” or “Daddy,” or –

18 MR . MESEREAU: Objection. Nonresponsive;

19 calls for a narrative.

20 MR . SNEDDON : Your Honor, this is the

28 things on the videotape .

1519

1 Q. What did he tell you to say on the

2 videotape?

3 A. He told me to say that he helped me , and

4 that he — he pretty much cured me of cancer .

5 Q. Did you do that?

6 A. Um –

7 Q. On the video?

8 A. Yeah.

9 Q. Was it true ?

10 A. Not really, because he — during my cancer,

11 he wasn’t really even there. I mean, the real

12 people — I mean, it ‘s, like, the real people who

13 were there were George Lopez, because he would

14 always visit me in the hospital like every day, and

15 he would bring me shirts and stuff. Chris Tucker

16 would always visit me in the hospital. Louise

17 Palanker would come and we ‘d make jokes because ,

18 like, I wasn’t good at smelling stuff. Chemotherapy

19 would clear out everything . And then Fritz Coleman,

20 would always come with Louise and talk to me , and –

21 Q. At this point in time, when you went up to

22 the Bashir video –

23 A. Yeah.

24 Q. – to the Bashir interview , okay ? –

27 Jackson?

28 A. Yeah. I was like –

1520

1 Q. What was your attitude towards Mr. Jackson

2 at this point in time?

3 A. I thought, like, he was the coolest guy in

4 the world. He was like my best friend ever. Do you

5 know what I mean?

6 Q. So you had a genuine affection for Mr.

7 Jackson at this time ?

8 A. Yeah, I really liked him. He was like — I

9 don’t know, he was just — like — I –

10 Q. So during the course of the interview with

11 Mr . Bashir – okay ? – after that interview was

12 completed, all right ?

13 A. Uh -huh.

14 Q. Tell us what happened after the interview

15 was completed. Was there any other filming that

16 went on that day?

17 A. No , I don’t think so .

18 Q. Do you know whether or not your brother and

19 sister ever got their picture taken in the filming ?

20 A. Well, yeah. Well , there was one time that I

22 know the camera was on. And they were inside of the

16 defendant in this case, did you know that that video

17 was going to be shown around the world ?

18 A. No , not at all . I thought it was another

19 thing like — like he had filmed before, like him

20 carrying me across the bridge , that video . I

21 thought it was going to be another thing like that ,

22 like he was going to , like , put it away somewhere

23 and keep it just for himself.

24 Q. Had there been other instances on the ranch

25 where you had been filmed with Mr. Jackson, other

2 Q. Now, after the filming was over, do you

3 recall seeing Mr. Jackson at all , after that ?

4 A. After the film ? After the Martin Bashir

5 thing ?

6 Q. Yes.

7 A. Well, I think he left, like, the next day .

8 And me and my brother and my sister , like , stood up

9 there , and we were, like, swimming and stuff .

10 Q. Did you have any contact with Mr . Jackson

11 after the filming ?

12 A. No . Like, the same thing happened. Like ,

13 the phone number they gave me while I was up there

14 wasn’t working no more.

15 Q. It ‘s a bad question on my part.

16 While you were at the ranch for the Mr .

17 Bashir filming and after the filming was over with

18 but before you and your brother or your sister left,

19 did you have any contact with Mr . Jackson at all?

20 A. No . A day after the filming, he left the

21 ranch and went somewhere.

22 Q. So where did you spend the night after the

23 Bashir film ?

24 A. In our unit that they gave us .

25 MR . SNEDDON : Your Honor, this would be a

26 good place to stop. If you want me to go on –

27 THE COURT : All right . You know, I’ve

28 decided that if I have to go to the rest room, I’m

2 important call .”
