Mr. Nicola: I'd like to show you Exhibit No. 20. Do you recognize the man in Exhibit 20?
Cynthia Montgomery: I do.
Mr. Nicola: And who is that?

Mr. Nicola: Did you ever have occasion to meet a man by the name of Vinnie or Vincent Black?

Mr. Nicola: When you made these travel arrangements, were they in connection with flights that Mr. Jackson was also taking?
Cynthia Montgomery: Sometimes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. How about if they were by private jet?
Cynthia Montgomery: Sometimes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And at other times what kind of arrangements did you make for those men?
Cynthia Montgomery: Commercial flights.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Now, with respect to the period of late 2002 and up to late September of 2003, did you have multiple occasions to make flights for Mr. Jackson where Mr. Konitzer or Mr. Weizner were also on the same flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I did.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Who made arrangements for those flights? In other words, who contacted you to set the flights up?
Cynthia Montgomery: There would have been two people.
Mr. Nicola: Let's start with the first person.
Cynthia Montgomery: Michael's assistant, Evvy Tavasci.
Mr. Nicola: And did she contact you through a company that she was working in? Was there a company name associated with Evvy Tavasci?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: What was that?
Cynthia Montgomery: MJJ Productions.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. So Ms. Tavasci would contact you and then what would happen?
Cynthia Montgomery: I would arrange for jets or commercial flights per her instructions.
Mr. Nicola: She would send you instructions about where Mr. Jackson wanted to go?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: And then you would do what?
Cynthia Montgomery: I would make a phone call to reserve a jet for him.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Was there a company that you worked with primarily in reserving a jet for Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And what was that company?
Cynthia Montgomery: Xtra Jet.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Did Miss Tavasci ever contact you to arrange travel for Mr. Amen, Mr. Cascio, Mr. Konitzer, or Mr. Weizner that did not involve commercial aircraft? Excuse me --
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Excuse me, private aircraft.
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Nicola: Who was the second person that contacted you to arrange travel?
Cynthia Montgomery: Fred Marc Schaffel.
Mr. Nicola: And did he work through a company?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And what was the name of that company?
Cynthia Montgomery: Neverland Valley Entertainment.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And was that his company, to your knowledge?
Cynthia Montgomery: And Mr. Jackson's.
Mr. Nicola: A joint company?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Move to strike.
The Court: Strike the answer.
Mr. Nicola: Just a yes or no question: Do you know who the principals of Neverland Valley Entertainment were?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And how did you come to that knowledge?
Cynthia Montgomery: Through Mr. Schaffel.
Mr. Nicola: Was it something Mr. Schaffel told you?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: What did he tell you about the principals of Neverland Valley Entertainment?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay and foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Nicola: We'd be offering them under admissions, Your Honor, of agents.
The Court: Excuse me?
Mr. Nicola: We'd be offering them under admissions of agents, Your Honor.
The Court: The objection is sustained.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. When Mr. Schaffel contacted you, was it always on behalf of Neverland Valley Entertainment?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Mr. Nicola: Let me rephrase it. I'd like to clean that up, if I may, Your Honor.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Nicola: When Mr. Schaffel contacted you with respect to making flights or travel arrangements, was it always through Neverland Valley Entertainment?
Cynthia Montgomery: Could you be more specific?
Mr. Nicola: Certainly. For travel arrangements -- did Mr. Schaffel ever call you to make travel arrangements for Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And did he do that through Neverland Valley Entertainment?
Cynthia Montgomery: Most of the time, yes.
Mr. Nicola: Most of the time, yes. Did he ever make those arrangements for Mr. Jackson through MJJ Productions?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Let's talk about how the arrangements were made. If Mr. Schaffel or Miss Tavasci called you and wanted to arrange a flight for Mr. Jackson, who would be responsible for paying the bill for that flight?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Nicola: Do you know how billing was arranged?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I do.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Please explain that to the jury.
Cynthia Montgomery: Um --
Mr. Mesereau: Same objection. Foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Nicola: How -- do you know how the billing was arranged for the private flights for Mr. Jackson that you arranged?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation and assumes facts not in evidence, no personal knowledge.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Nicola: Do you have personal knowledge of how the billing was arranged for the private flights that you set up for Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Explain that for the jury, please.
Mr. Mesereau: Same objection. Foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Nicola: Who was billed -- or did you do the billing for the private flights that you set up for Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did the billing.
Mr. Nicola: You did the billing?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Who did you charge for those flights?
Cynthia Montgomery: Two different accounts. Neverland Valley or his business managers, Whitman Fox.
Mr. Nicola: Neverland Valley Entertainment and who else?
Cynthia Montgomery: Bernstein Fox & Whitman Company.
Mr. Nicola: Did you ever bill MJJ Productions?
Cynthia Montgomery: I might have.
Mr. Mesereau: Move to strike. Speculation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Nicola: Do you have any recollection of whether or not you billed --
The Court: I'll strike that. I'm sorry, I just wanted the record to reflect I struck that.
Mr. Nicola: Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Mr. Nicola: Do you have any recollection of billing MJJ Productions directly?
Cynthia Montgomery: I might have.
Mr. Mesereau: Move to strike; speculation.
Mr. Nicola: Let me ask you a different question.
The Court: Stricken.
Mr. Nicola: Did you ever pay for those flights prior to being reimbursed?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Could you explain how that would come about?
Cynthia Montgomery: Well, I act as an agent, second party. I would be invoiced by Xtra Jet and, in turn, I would invoice one of the companies. I've --
Mr. Nicola: Okay. So Xtra Jet would send you the bill?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: And that's how you would know the billing was arranged?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: Then you would send an invoice to which companies to get payment?
Cynthia Montgomery: Depending on which company I was instructed to bill. Either Neverland Valley or MJJ or Bernstein Fox.
Mr. Nicola: And who would --
Cynthia Montgomery: -- invoice MJJ. Sorry?
Mr. Nicola: Who would you receive billing instructions from?
Cynthia Montgomery: Either Mr. Schaffel or Miss Tavasci.
Mr. Nicola: As part of your responsibility in arranging flights for Mr. Jackson to keep the flight manifests as part of your records?
Cynthia Montgomery: It's an FAA requirement.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Could you tell us how a flight manifest is transmitted to you with respect to these flights that we're talking about?
Cynthia Montgomery: Either verbally or via fax or e-mail.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And was that the same as the reservations, the information came to you from Mr. Schaffel or Miss Tavasci?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. If I may approach the witness again, Your Honor. Mr. Mesereau, Exhibit 251, 253 and 254. Now I'm going to approach.
Mr. Nicola: Mrs. Montgomery, I've placed in front of you a three-ring binder, which is opened to a page that has an exhibit sticker on the bottom right-hand corner, Exhibit No. 251; is that correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Do you recognize that document?
Cynthia Montgomery: I do.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And can you please turn the pages and review each of the documents in that section labeled 251. Did you go on to page 252?
Cynthia Montgomery: Did I go to page 253?
Mr. Nicola: 252.
Cynthia Montgomery: No, I did not.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Do you recognize Exhibit 251, ma'am?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I do.
Mr. Nicola: What is that?
Cynthia Montgomery: It's a flight manifest. It's a bill from Xtra Jet, it's a passenger trip sheet, and it's a trip report from the pilots.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. How do you recognize those documents in Exhibit 251?
Cynthia Montgomery: The first page is addressed to me from Evvy. The second page is the trip sheet from Xtra Jet, which I always get after a flight is terminated. I have an invoice here made out to my company. And I have the pilots' report.
Mr. Nicola: Are the items in Exhibit 251 records that are kept within the normal course and scope of your business as a travel consultant?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, they are.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And do you regularly rely upon the contents of those documents in Exhibit 251 in the regular course and scope of your business?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And is the information contained within the documents in Exhibit 251 recorded at or near the time of the event purported?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, they are.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. We'd move 251 into evidence, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation, hearsay, and authentication.
The Court: All right. It's admitted. It's a business record.
Mr. Nicola: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Nicola: Now, with respect to the first page dated June 6th, 2003, of 251.
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Nicola: May I have “Input 4”, Your Honor? Counsel, do you object to this exhibit?
Mr. Mesereau: No.
Mr. Nicola: Mrs. Montgomery, if you would take a look over your shoulder, please. And is that the first page of -- a copy of the first page that you have there in Exhibit 251?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And is this an example of how Miss Tavasci would contact you with respect to setting up a flight for Mr. Jackson on a private aircraft?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: And this particular request came to you on June 6th of 2003?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: There appears to be two columns with names, and that -- are those names provided to you by Miss Tavasci in the regular course of setting these flights up?
Cynthia Montgomery: The normal course.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. The “M. Jackson” on the top and the “Marc Schaffel” on the bottom, are these typically the ways you would set the flights up for Mr. Jackson, using Marc Schaffel's middle name, “Marc”, and Mr. Jackson's first initial, “M”.?
Cynthia Montgomery: It's the way Evvy would transmit it to me.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Were there ever occasions when the flight instructions from Ms. Tavasci with respect to who's going to be on the flight, were there ever occasions when those instructions were changed?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. The flights again, please. If you could turn the page, please, to Exhibit 253, please. And flip through the documents in Exhibit 253 and review them, please.
Cynthia Montgomery: Okay.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Do you recognize those documents?
Cynthia Montgomery: I do.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And do they relate to a flight that you arranged for Mr. Jackson and his entourage on September 12th of 2003?
Cynthia Montgomery: I do. I recognize it.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Are the contents of Exhibit 253 records of similar nature as Exhibit 251, kept within the normal course and scope of your business, et cetera?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Did you rely on these documents as well within the regular course of your business?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And are these copies of your actual records for this flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: We'd move Exhibit 253 into evidence, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation, hearsay, authenticity.
The Court: They're admitted.
Mr. Nicola: If I may have the Elmo again, Your Honor.
Cynthia Montgomery: Can I ask you something? If you're going to show the one with my address, can you block it out, please?
Mr. Nicola: The witness has asked that a particular address on this document be blacked out.
Bailiff Cortez: Microphone, sir.
Mr. Nicola: I had the mike off. Do you object, Mr. Mesereau?
Mr. Mesereau: No.
Mr. Nicola: May I have a sticky, please?
Mr. Nicola: And is your business name up here on this exhibit?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: I'm sorry, Mrs. Montgomery. May I have “Input 4”, Your Honor? These are difficult to work, I'll tell you that right now. Okay. Now, Exhibit 253, this was a flight on September 16th of 2003, and the customer name up there appears to be Class A Travel Services. That's one of your companies?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Did you receive a flight manifest for that particular trip?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I did.
Mr. Nicola: If you'd turn to page -- the second page of Exhibit 253. Is there a handwritten passenger list?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, there is.
Mr. Nicola: Okay.
Cynthia Montgomery: May I reiterate something? I no longer do business as Class A Travel, just for the record.
Mr. Nicola: You do business as a different company?
Cynthia Montgomery: Now I do, correct.
Mr. Nicola: Okay.
Cynthia Montgomery: It's a former company.
Mr. Nicola: But back in the period of time that we're talking about, late 2002 through September of 2003, you did business as Class A Travel and Uniglobe?
Cynthia Montgomery: Back in that period of time, Class A Travel and Travel 21.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Is Mr. Jackson's name on this list, obviously?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And was it uncommon for you to get a handwritten passenger list such as this?
Cynthia Montgomery: This is from the pilot of the plane company.
Mr. Nicola: And these are records that you also keep for billing purposes?
Cynthia Montgomery: There's times where I would have these records, yes.
Mr. Nicola: If you could turn to the fourth page. Let me show that, Your Honor. Now, is this document the actual request from Miss Tavasci for you to set up a flight on the 16th?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, it was. Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: And the names on her list, the passenger names are a little bit different; isn't that right?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: Would that happen on occasion?
Cynthia Montgomery: All the time.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And finally, if you'd turn to the next page, there appears to be yet another list of individuals for the same flight.
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: And what is the purpose of this document?
Cynthia Montgomery: It was for the U.S. Customs.
Mr. Nicola: Was this an international flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, it was.
Mr. Nicola: Where did it go?
Cynthia Montgomery: To Canada.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And then it came back to the U.S.?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: Do you see the bottom name written on there, Ronald Konitzer?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I do.
Mr. Nicola: Is it uncommon for you to receive records from Xtra Jet with additional names on the list handwritten?
Cynthia Montgomery: No, it's not.
Mr. Nicola: If you could turn to Exhibit No. 254, please, and page through those.
Cynthia Montgomery: Okay.
Mr. Nicola: Do you recognize the contents of Exhibit 254 as records that you kept within the regular course and scope of your business?
Cynthia Montgomery: I do.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Was the information recorded in those documents recorded at or near the time of the events recorded in Exhibit 254?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And are they records that you normally rely upon in the course of your business?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: We'd move Exhibit 254 into evidence, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay, foundation, and authenticity.
The Court: They're admitted.
Mr. Nicola: Now, 254 contains information with respect to two individual flights; is that correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And the first three pages relate to a flight from Boca Raton to California on February 25th, 2003; is that right?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. I'd like to show you the first page of that exhibit, if I may, with “Input 4”. Now, is this an example that -- a flight that Mr. Schaffel set up for Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: It appears to be that way, yes.
Mr. Nicola: Do you have a specific recollection of this flight from Boca Raton to -- is that Van Nuys, VNY?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: That's in California?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: Do you have a specific recollection of this?
Cynthia Montgomery: I do.
Mr. Nicola: How did that flight get set up, if you remember?
Cynthia Montgomery: I received a phone call from Mr. Schaffel and -- saying he needed an airplane.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. From Florida to California?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: On the 25th --
Cynthia Montgomery: Right.
Mr. Nicola: -- of February of 2003?
Cynthia Montgomery: Right.
Mr. Nicola: Did you receive a passenger list for that flight from anyone?
Cynthia Montgomery: On the third page, it could be the manifest from Evvy. Yes, this is the passenger manifest for this flight.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And did that come to you in a different format?
Cynthia Montgomery: No. Normal procedure. E-mail.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. The passengers on this Xtra Jet flight were Mr. Jackson, appears to be two of his children, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: Do you know who Grace Ru -- I can't say that last name.
Cynthia Montgomery: Rwaramba, I believe.
Mr. Nicola: Rwaramba?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Do you know who that individual is?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I do.
Mr. Nicola: How do you know who she is?
Cynthia Montgomery: I was told.
Mr. Nicola: Is she a frequent flyer with Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe so.
Mr. Nicola: How about Patricia Chavez?
Cynthia Montgomery: Also I know who she is.
Mr. Nicola: Mr. LaPerruque, Mr. Crawford and Mr. Carter, are you familiar with those individuals?
Cynthia Montgomery: With the exception of Daniel Crawford, yes.
Mr. Nicola: How do you know Mr. LaPerruque?
Cynthia Montgomery: Because I was told who he was.
Mr. Nicola: Did he frequently fly with Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: I can't be certain.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. How about Mr. Carter?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Did he fly with Mr. Jackson frequently?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Are you familiar with the names Marie Nicole Cascio and Aldo Cascio?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And are they related to Frank Cascio, to your knowledge?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Were they also frequently on Mr. Jackson's private aircraft?
Cynthia Montgomery: I won't say frequently.
Mr. Nicola: Not frequently?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Before we turn to the second flight that's contained within Exhibit 254, if we could discuss the bottom entry here where it says, “Catering”. Were you responsible for arranging the catering on Mr. Jackson's private aircraft?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: How would you set the catering up?
Cynthia Montgomery: I would call it in to -- I would call it in to Xtra Jet to the representative I worked with there.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And were you familiar with what Mr. Jackson wanted on his flights?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: He was your client?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. It was important for you to please him, I suspect?
Cynthia Montgomery: Of course.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Would you inform Xtra Jet in writing or verbally as to what should be catered for Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: I would forward the manifest -- or the request from Evvy as well as verbally instruct them.
Mr. Nicola: Were there standard instructions that just were not relayed to you from Miss Tavasci in writing?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Could you describe one of those requests?
Cynthia Montgomery: She always wanted --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Cynthia Montgomery: She told me --
The Court: Just a minute.
Cynthia Montgomery: Sorry.
The Court: Just a minute.
Mr. Nicola: Just a minute.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Without telling us the content of your conversation with Ms. Tavasci, she would relate the special needs, or any needs for the particular flight, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. With respect to serving alcohol on Mr. Jackson's private aircraft, Xtra Jet's private aircraft that you arranged for him, did you ever make arrangements for alcohol to be served to Mr. Jackson?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading and foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I did.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Did you ever make specific instructions as to how Mr. Jackson should be served alcohol?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I did.
Mr. Nicola: With respect to wine, did you ever instruct any Xtra Jet employees on how to serve Mr. Jackson wine?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I did.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Prior to making those instructions, did you receive information from a Lauren Wallace about how Mr. Jackson wanted his wine served to him?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I did.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And did you know Lauren Wallace as a flight attendant?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes. She is.
Mr. Nicola: Was she the primary flight attendant for Mr. Jackson during your period of service?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Yes, she was?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, she was.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And in what period of time did you receive the instructions from Ms. Wallace?
Cynthia Montgomery: Through the course that we handled his private flights.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Do you recall what Miss Wallace told you specifically about how Mr. Jackson was being served his wine?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I do.
Mr. Nicola: Can you please relay that to the jury?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Cynthia Montgomery: She told me --
Mr. Nicola: Could you speak up, please.
Cynthia Montgomery: Lauren Wallace told me that Mr. Jackson had requested that his wine be put into soda cans, and then if she was ever unable -- you can't always ensure that we're always going to have the same flight crew. To respect his privacy and to relay the message to anyone other than her if she was not flying to -- how to serve him.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. So Ms. Wallace told you that was Mr. Jackson's request to her?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: Could we turn back to Exhibit 253, please? And the last page appears to be an invoice for a flight on March 25th of 2003.
Cynthia Montgomery: You said Exhibit 253?
Mr. Nicola: I'm sorry, I meant 254.
Cynthia Montgomery: Okay.
Mr. Nicola: Please turn to the last page of Exhibit 254.
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Are there handwritten notes all over that exhibit?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, there are.
Mr. Nicola: Is that your handwriting?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: If I may have “Input 4”, Your Honor. Thank you.
Mr. Nicola: Now, in the upper left-hand corner, does that exhibit show a billing address for MJJ Productions of Provident Financial Management?
Cynthia Montgomery: It does.
Mr. Nicola: Did you cross that out?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Nicola: And why was that?
Cynthia Montgomery: He had terminated his relationship with them.
Mr. Nicola: And you were told to bill another entity; is that correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: Did you write that entity's name on the bottom of the document?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Nicola: And was that Bernstein, Fox & Whitman?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Did you ever have occasion to keep a passenger profile for Mr. Jackson --
Cynthia Montgomery: Um --
Mr. Nicola: -- in writing?
Cynthia Montgomery: There is a document that I'm aware of in writing.
Mr. Nicola: Would you turn to Exhibit No. 252.
Cynthia Montgomery: Okay.
Mr. Nicola: I believe I'm finished with the Elmo, Your Honor.
Mr. Nicola: Now, Exhibit 252 appears to be a passenger profile for Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: Did you generate that document?
Cynthia Montgomery: Verbally.
Mr. Nicola: You verbally generated that document?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Nicola: And for what purpose?
Cynthia Montgomery: For the purpose of his -- it would be on file for Mr. Jackson for his specific needs on board his flights.
Mr. Nicola: Now, are the contents of Exhibit 252 consistent with your instructions to the flight crews of Xtra Jet with regard to how Mr. Jackson should be taken care of with respect to catering?
Cynthia Montgomery: Could you repeat that, please?
Mr. Nicola: Have you read through the exhibit?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Are the instructions in there consistent with the instructions that you gave Xtra Jet?
Cynthia Montgomery: They're more specific.
Mr. Nicola: Okay.
Cynthia Montgomery: Mine were general. These are specific.
Mr. Nicola: Is there a specific reference to putting white wine in Diet Coke cans in every flight?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Nicola: Did you go by the name Cindy Greenberg?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Nicola: Back when Mr. Jackson was your client?
Cynthia Montgomery: Some of the time.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And were you listed as one of Mr. Jackson's contact people along with Evvy?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. If I may approach Madam Clerk. This is next in order, and this is next in order.
The Clerk: Mr. Sneddon has the stickies.
Mr. Nicola: Mr. Sneddon has the stickies?
Mr. Sneddon: They're right there.
Mr. Nicola: I'm off like a herd of turtles today. I'd like to show you Exhibits 848 and 849, please.
Cynthia Montgomery: Okay.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Do you recognize the contents of Exhibit 848?
Cynthia Montgomery: I do.
Mr. Nicola: And that appears to be a two-page document, front and back?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Is that a document that you generated?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And did you do that in the normal course and scope of your business?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Nicola: And are the entries -- let me ask you this a different way: Is the information in that exhibit recorded at or near the time that the information was recorded?
Cynthia Montgomery: A little vague.
Mr. Nicola: I asked the same question two different ways. Does the information accurately reflect the entries that you made? You actually entered this information, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: That is correct.
Mr. Nicola: And can you describe what the exhibit is for the jury? Just generally, and we'll get more specific.
Cynthia Montgomery: It's called a PNR, a passenger name record. It's a reservation made through an airline computer system reflecting someone's flights that they would take. A reservation, basically, with names, itinerary.
Mr. Nicola: You personally entered this information into the computer system and this is a printout of what you entered?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Is it a record you keep in the -- that you keep and rely upon in the ordinary course of your business?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: We'd move 848 into evidence, Your Honor.
The Court: Are you looking for the document, Mr. Mesereau?
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me, Your Honor?
The Court: He made a motion to introduce 848 into evidence. I didn't know if you were looking for the document or....
Mr. Mesereau: No, it was produced this morning by the prosecutor. No objection, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. There's no objection. I'll admit it.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. With respect to Exhibit 849, is that also information that you entered consistent with 848 only with respect to a different client and a different flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: Are those reservations for Mr. Fred Schaffel?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. We'd move that into evidence as well, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: No objection.
The Court: It's admitted.
Mr. Nicola: May I have the “Input 4”, please?
Mr. Nicola: I'll show you the first page of Exhibit 848. It works better that way. With respect to generating this reservation, do you recall having a conversation with Mr. Fred Schaffel on or around February 25th of 2003?
Cynthia Montgomery: I do.
Mr. Nicola: And how did that conversation begin; do you recall?
Cynthia Montgomery: He called me and asked me to make --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Nicola: Statements in furtherance, Your Honor.
The Court: Well, the question was, “How did that conversation begin?” And the answer was, “He called me..”., and then she started to volunteer the information. So the objection is sustained.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Did he ask you to do something for him?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And what did he ask?
Mr. Mesereau: Same objection.
Mr. Nicola: Our offer of proof is in furtherance.
The Court: I'll admit this document under the previous instructions, limited to the use of conspiracy evidence. Remember those conditional instructions I gave you earlier? All right. Go ahead. It's admitted under those provisions.
Mr. Nicola: Okay, Your Honor.
Mr. Nicola: You can relay what he asked you to do for him, please.
Cynthia Montgomery: He asked me to make flight arrangements for four passengers to Brazil.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And are the names of those four passengers listed on this document?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, they are.
Mr. Nicola: Did you personally highlight the lines within that exhibit prior to court?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I did.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And are the names listed on this reservation easily available to you to read to the jury?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, they are.
Mr. Nicola: Please do so.
Cynthia Montgomery: Arvizo, Janet; Arvizo, Davellin; Arvizo, Star; Arvizo, Gavin.
Mr. Nicola: Did Mr. Schaffel tell you where he wanted the Arvizos to fly to?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, he did.
Mr. Nicola: Where?
Cynthia Montgomery: To Brazil, Sao Paulo.
Mr. Nicola: You're going to have to speak up.
Cynthia Montgomery: Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Mr. Nicola: Okay.
Cynthia Montgomery: South America.
Mr. Nicola: Did he make a specific request as to what kind of tickets he wanted --
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, he did.
Mr. Nicola: -- for the Arvizos? He did?
Cynthia Montgomery: One-way tickets.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Is it possible for U.S. citizens to get into Brazil with a one-way ticket?
Cynthia Montgomery: No, it's not.
Mr. Nicola: Why is that?
Cynthia Montgomery: For visa reasons, you must have a return ticket to enter the country.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Did you make arrangements for return tickets for the Arvizos?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did. I chose the date.
Mr. Nicola: You chose the date for their return?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Nicola: Was that done arbitrarily or did you discuss that with Mr. Schaffel?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Cynthia Montgomery: I chose a date arbitrarily, and then I called him to tell him what I had done and the reason why I did it.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. When you finished making these arrangements for the Arvizos to travel to Brazil, how many days' notice did you give the airline before the flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: Just a couple days.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. The flight was scheduled to leave on what date?
Cynthia Montgomery: March the 1st of 2003.
Mr. Nicola: And you made the reservation on the 25th of February, 2003?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: What was the cost going to be for that flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: For a party of four, 15,092.
Mr. Nicola: Were you flying them first class?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Nicola: Those are coach prices?
Cynthia Montgomery: Coach. They were open tickets, basically. You know, they're expensive.
Mr. Nicola: Did Mr. Schaffel ask you to do anything with the reservations once they were made?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, he did.
Mr. Nicola: What did he ask you to do, please?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Nicola: Same offer of proof, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. I'm going to admit this for the limited purpose. Go ahead.
Cynthia Montgomery: To fax over the itinerary. Because they needed passports.
Mr. Nicola: If you'd take a look at the board behind you, there appears to be in the far right, in yellow highlighter, an address for Miss Janet Arvizo that begins at least with 11520, what I believe is Trent. Do you see that on your original document?
Cynthia Montgomery: I do.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Was that information provided by Ms. Arvizo or Mr. Schaffel?
Cynthia Montgomery: Mr. Schaffel.
Mr. Nicola: Did you ever speak to Ms. Arvizo about these flight arrangements?
Cynthia Montgomery: Not to my recollection, no.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. How about any members of her family?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Nicola: If I may have just a moment, Your Honor. I just have a few more questions, if that's okay. I don't need the inputs anymore, Judge. Thank you.
Mr. Nicola: Now, with respect to the reservations you made for the Arvizos to travel to Brazil on March 1st of 2003, assuming they made that flight that left on March 1st, 2003, was there any requirement for them to make the return flight on the date that you chose?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; calls for speculation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Nicola: To your knowledge, would they have been able to stay in Brazil indefinitely?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Relevance; calls for speculation; foundation.
The Court: Sustained; foundation.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. I believe I have no further questions at this time, Judge.
The Court: Cross-examine?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please, Your Honor. If I may, Your Honor, I'm just trying to locate one book.
The Court: Go ahead.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Good morning.
Cynthia Montgomery: Good morning, Mr. Mesereau.
Mr. Mesereau: Miss Montgomery, we have not spoken before, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: No, we have not.
Mr. Mesereau: And as you know, I'm Tom Mesereau, and I speak for Michael Jackson, okay?
Cynthia Montgomery: I understand.
Mr. Mesereau: If I say anything that's not clear to you, please don't answer it, just let me know you don't understand the question, and I'll try and rephrase it, okay?
Cynthia Montgomery: Absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. You are testifying under what is called immunity, correct?
Mr. Nicola: Objection. Misstates the evidence, Your Honor. It's use immunity.
The Court: The objection is overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe I am, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you received a grant of immunity yesterday, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Verbally, I believe I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And immunity means you cannot be prosecuted for statements you make in court today, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Your position was if you did not receive a grant of immunity, you would not testify, correct?
Mr. Nicola: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Um, per my lawyer's instructions. That's what he requested.
Mr. Mesereau: And who is your attorney?
Cynthia Montgomery: Robert Moore.
Mr. Mesereau: And he is from Los Angeles, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Your position, through your attorney, was that unless you were immunized from any prosecution based on what you said today, you would not testify as a witness, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's what he asked me to do, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's what you agreed to do, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: When your lawyer made that request in this court, you were present, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And to your knowledge, a legal grant of immunity means no one, particularly in the federal government, can come after you for anything you say today under oath, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: To the best of my knowledge, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And the reason you wanted that legal grant of immunity is because currently there is an FBI investigation into allegations that you and others secretly videotaped Michael Jackson on an Xtra Jet flight, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: I am a witness for that case, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: My question to you is, the reason you wanted a grant of legal immunity was because you know the FBI is currently investigating allegations that you and others secretly videotaped Michael Jackson on an Xtra Jet flight, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: I can't answer that yes or no.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you saying that you've never heard of any FBI investigation into that subject?
Cynthia Montgomery: No. I've spoken to the FBI voluntarily twice.
Mr. Mesereau: Then you're aware of the investigation, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Pertaining to the allegation, correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How long have you known Frederic Marc Schaffel?
Cynthia Montgomery: Approximately 20 years.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you done business with him before?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What business have you done with him before?
Cynthia Montgomery: Travel arrangements.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you done that for him for 20 years?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: How long have you made travel arrangements for Marc Schaffel?
Cynthia Montgomery: I couldn't be certain of that.
Mr. Mesereau: What's your estimate?
Cynthia Montgomery: Whenever he needed a flight. Ten years, maybe? 15 years?
Mr. Mesereau: When did you last talk to him?
Cynthia Montgomery: November 20th, 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you aware that Mr. Schaffel is currently suing Mr. Jackson for millions of dollars?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You also are currently suing Mr. Jackson, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Not for millions of dollars. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You also are currently suing Mr. Jackson, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes. He's suing me.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Jackson is suing you for invasion of privacy, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you represented by counsel in Mr. Jackson's suit against you for invasion of privacy?
Cynthia Montgomery: I am.
Mr. Mesereau: And who is your lawyer on that case?
Cynthia Montgomery: Robert Moore.
Mr. Mesereau: And who is representing you in your suit against Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: Mr. Moore.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you're aware that if Mr. Jackson is convicted in this case, Mr. Schaffel will have a much easier time winning his suit, right?
Mr. Nicola: Objection. Calls for speculation and it's argumentative.
The Court: Sustained; speculation.
Mr. Mesereau: If Mr. Jackson is convicted in this case, you would have an easier time winning your suit, wouldn't you?
Cynthia Montgomery: No, I would not.
Mr. Nicola: Same objection, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Nicola: Move to strike the answer.
The Court: Stricken.
Bailiff Cortez: Your microphone, sir. Your microphone, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: The lawsuit Mr. Jackson has filed against you has to do with an Xtra Jet flight on November 21st, 2003, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: No, sir. It's November 20th.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. My mistake.
Cynthia Montgomery: But to answer your question, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: So November 20th of 2003 was the flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That's the flight that is the subject of controversy in the litigation, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And you said you last talked to Mr. Schaffel around that time; is that true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, it is.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Schaffel wasn't on that flight, to your knowledge, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes. No, he was not on that flight.
Mr. Mesereau: But you're aware that Mr. Jackson was secretly recorded --
Cynthia Montgomery: I learned that after.
Mr. Mesereau: -- and videotaped on that flight, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: I learned it after the fact.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you the one who made arrangements for Mr. Jackson to fly on that particular flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: I made arrangements like I normally do for him.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you make arrangements for Mr. Jackson to fly on an Xtra Jet flight on November 20th, 2003?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever talk to Mr. Schaffel about those flight arrangements?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And you're aware that not only was Mr. Jackson secretly videotaped on the flight but someone tried to sell that videotape, right?
Mr. Nicola: Objection. Calls for hearsay and relevance and vague as to “someone”.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: The allegations against you in that case are that Mr. Jackson was secretly videotaped and recorded and that efforts were made to sell that for profit, true?
Mr. Nicola: Objection; calls for hearsay.
Mr. Mesereau: State of mind, Your Honor.
Mr. Nicola: Then relevance.
Mr. Mesereau: And bias.
The Court: The objection is overruled. I'm going to have the question read back so you can understand the question.
The Court Reporter: The allegations against you in that case are that Mr. Jackson was secretly videotaped and recorded and that efforts were made to sell that for profit, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe so. I have not read the suit against me.
Mr. Mesereau: The reservations for that flight were made through a company called Travel 21, Inc.; is that true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that your company?
Cynthia Montgomery: I was -- I leased space from that company.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, was the reservation made through the company Travel 21, Inc., to your knowledge?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's how I did the billing on that particular flight.
Mr. Mesereau: But you made those reservations, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: You directly made those reservations with Xtra Jet, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point before you made those reservations, you were asked to use a different company, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: A different billing company or a different plane company?
Mr. Mesereau: A different plane company.
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I was.
Mr. Mesereau: You insisted on using Xtra Jet, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: I didn't insist. It was to my client's better -- for his better being.
Mr. Mesereau: It was your recommendation that Mr. Jackson fly on Xtra Jet during the flight on November 20th, 2003, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: It was my -- I discussed it with Mr. Schaffel and we thought it was in the best interest of our client to use Xtra Jet, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: So you and Mr. Schaffel made the arrangements for the flight, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: I made the arrangements, but I had discussed it with Mr. Schaffel.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When did you learn that -- excuse me. Let me rephrase that. When did you first learn that Mr. Jackson had been secretly videotaped and recorded on that particular flight with Xtra Jet?
Cynthia Montgomery: November 21st of 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, has Mr. Schaffel been involved in any efforts to sell that videotape or audiotape?
Cynthia Montgomery: Not to my knowledge. Mr. Mesereau, I don't believe there's audio.
Mr. Nicola: Objection, no question pending.
Cynthia Montgomery: Sorry. Okay.
Mr. Nicola: Rules.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you going to say you don't believe there's an audio recording?
Cynthia Montgomery: To the best of my knowledge. I don't know of any audio recording.
Mr. Mesereau: But you know of a video recording?
Cynthia Montgomery: I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you seen it?
Cynthia Montgomery: In the FBI building, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, how long will your grant of legal immunity last for?
Cynthia Montgomery: I have no idea, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You haven't learned through your counsel --
Mr. Nicola: Objection.
Mr. Mesereau: -- how long you'd be immunized from any prosecution based on what you say today?
Mr. Nicola: Objection, Your Honor, that is vague.
The Court: It violates a privilege.
Mr. Mesereau: For -- let me rephrase that. When did you begin booking flights for Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe in 2000 -- the latter part of 2000. May have been 2001.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you met Mr. Jackson twice, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And where did you first meet Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: On his ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: Approximately when was that?
Cynthia Montgomery: September of 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you stay at the ranch?
Cynthia Montgomery: Overnight?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When was the second time you ever met Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: In Las Vegas.
Mr. Mesereau: And approximately when was that?
Cynthia Montgomery: And it was several times. October of 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: Typically any flights that were booked through you were arranged for someone other than Mr. Jackson. Excuse me, let me rephrase that. Typically any flights that you arranged for Mr. Jackson came through, I think you said Evvy or Mr. Schaffel; is that correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, how many flights do you think you booked at the direction of Evvy?
Cynthia Montgomery: Ninety-nine percent of them. Private jets.
Mr. Mesereau: How many flights do you think you booked at the direction of Mr. Schaffel?
Cynthia Montgomery: One percent.
The Court: Do you want to take a break, Counsel?
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, yes, Your Honor.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Sorry for the delay. The court reporters are having a little problem with the computer that runs their court reporting equipment. Go ahead, Counsel.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Miss Montgomery, I want to clarify a couple of questions I asked about your grant of legal use immunity, okay?
Cynthia Montgomery: (Nods head up and down.)
Mr. Mesereau: The kind of immunity you've been granted by the Court is called use immunity, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And use immunity means that anything you say in court today cannot be used against you, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You could, however, still be prosecuted for perjury, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: To the best of my knowledge, correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And the grant of use immunity that you have grew out of concerns about a possible prosecution over the secret videotaping of Mr. Jackson on that Xtra Jet flight, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were sued by Mr. Jackson and others, correct?
Mr. Nicola: Objection. This has been asked and answered, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: No, it hasn't, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Cynthia Montgomery: I sued him, and then he sued me back.
Mr. Mesereau: You also have been sued by Attorney Mark Geragos who was on that flight, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe so. I have not seen, actually, the lawsuit.
Mr. Mesereau: Is it your understanding that Mr. Jackson and his then attorney, Mr. Geragos, were secretly videotaped on an Xtra Jet flight?
Mr. Nicola: I believe that has been asked and answered. Object on those grounds.
Mr. Mesereau: Not with Mr. Geragos, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that is, in fact, the flight you booked, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: I booked the flight.
Mr. Mesereau: That's the flight you booked with the assistance of Mr. Schaffel, correct?
Mr. Nicola: Objection, Your Honor, that has been asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you indicated you met Mr. Jackson for the first time in approximately September of 2003, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Formally.
Mr. Mesereau: Formally?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you first meet Mr. Jackson in person?
Cynthia Montgomery: I've been introduced to him backstage at a concert.
Mr. Mesereau: And when was that?
Cynthia Montgomery: I don't recall. Many years ago.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know how many years ago that was?
Cynthia Montgomery: I couldn't tell you that.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't really have a discussion with him at that point, did you?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And were you attempting to try and get Mr. Jackson's business at the time?
Cynthia Montgomery: In September of .03?
Mr. Mesereau: The first time you met him.
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you in the travel business at that point?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it ever your goal to obtain Mr. Jackson as a client?
Cynthia Montgomery: When Mr. Schaffel approached me with it, of course.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did Mr. Schaffel approach you with the idea of booking flights for Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: When he became an associate of Mr. Jackson's.
Mr. Mesereau: When did Mr. Schaffel first approach you about booking flights for Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: I couldn't recall specifically.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately when it was?
Cynthia Montgomery: It was sometime in the year 2000.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you been booking flights for Mr. Schaffel before that date?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And I believe you said you have booked flights for Mr. Schaffel for approximately, what, 10, 15 years?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, are you the only one, to your knowledge, during that period that was booking flights for Mr. Schaffel?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Were other people booking flights for Mr. Schaffel as well?
Cynthia Montgomery: In my office, or --
Mr. Mesereau: Anywhere.
Cynthia Montgomery: Well, I can only speak for my office. There was someone else that could have done them.
Mr. Mesereau: And who else could have done it in your office?
Cynthia Montgomery: One of my assistants.
Mr. Mesereau: Would you have known about the flight if your assistant did it?
Cynthia Montgomery: Absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, during the 10 or 15 years that you booked flights -- excuse me. For the 10 or 15 years that you or your company booked flights for Mr. Schaffel, was it your understanding that you were the exclusive travel agent for Mr. Schaffel?
Cynthia Montgomery: Absolutely not.
Mr. Mesereau: Who else was booking flights for Mr. Schaffel at the time?
Cynthia Montgomery: I'm not privy to that information.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, how do you know someone else was?
Cynthia Montgomery: I -- I didn't say that I did. I have no idea. I have no knowledge. Other than in my office, I said I have no knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So as far as you know, during the 10 or 15 years that you or your office booked flights for Mr. Schaffel, you were the only people doing that, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: I don't believe that's what I said. I booked flights for him. Somebody in my office could have booked flights for him. I have no other knowledge if he went through another agency or directly through the airlines. I have no knowledge of that.
Mr. Mesereau: And during those 10 or 15 years, you have booked flights for Mr. Schaffel to Brazil, have you not?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I have.
Mr. Mesereau: You have booked many flights for Mr. Schaffel to Brazil, have you not?
Cynthia Montgomery: I don't -- I mean, without looking at the documents, I'm sure I have.
Mr. Mesereau: Why are you sure you have?
Cynthia Montgomery: I recall a few trips.
Mr. Mesereau: He has traveled to Brazil extensively through the years, has he not?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe he has.
Mr. Mesereau: How close a friend were you of Mr. Schaffel during the time you had a friendly relationship with him?
Cynthia Montgomery: We would socialize on occasion. Travel together.
Mr. Mesereau: And would that be -- would the socializing be in Las Vegas primarily?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Where would it be?
Cynthia Montgomery: Hawaii.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, when you met Mr. Jackson at Neverland in September of 2003, Mr. Schaffel was there, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, he was.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were there because Mr. Schaffel was conducting a fund-raiser, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, he was.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were assisting Mr. Schaffel in that fund-raiser, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And Mr. Schaffel arranged for the fund-raiser to take place at Neverland, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And then you say you met Mr. Jackson about a month later; is that true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And approximately when was that? Was that October?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And where was that, if you know?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I do. The Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Have you ever spoken to Mr. Jackson on the telephone?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When you arranged the flights you testified about earlier, you have never spoke to Mr. Jackson in any phone call about arranging those flights, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's true.
Mr. Mesereau: And it was Mr. Schaffel who talked to you about the flight to Brazil that was supposed to involve the Arvizos, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Were plane tickets ever purchased for that flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you last talk to Mr. Schaffel about that proposed flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: Sometime probably in February of 2001.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever talk --
Cynthia Montgomery: The year.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm sorry.
Cynthia Montgomery: The year. I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever talk to any member of the Arvizo family about that flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: No. Not that I'm aware of, no.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point you learned that that flight was going to be cancelled, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you learned the flight was going to be cancelled before you had a chance to buy any flight ticket, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And certainly, it goes without saying, you never sent any bill for any tickets or anything related to that flight, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's because Mr. Schaffel talked to you about what he wanted, but the flight never happened, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: He said he had a change of plans.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, around the time the plans were changed, to your knowledge, did Mr. Schaffel go to Brazil?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you arrange the flight for Mr. Schaffel to go to Brazil?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you arrange to purchase the tickets for Mr. Schaffel to go to Brazil?
Cynthia Montgomery: Indirectly.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. To your knowledge, did Mr. Schaffel go to Brazil alone?
Cynthia Montgomery: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And do you know approximately when Mr. Schaffel's flight to Brazil took place?
Cynthia Montgomery: Around the same time. March the 1st.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember whether you arranged a round-trip for Mr. Schaffel in March of 2003?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And to your knowledge, did he then return to the United States at some point?
Cynthia Montgomery: I can't swear that he actually took the flight.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you bought tickets for him, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Indirectly. I made reservations for him.
Mr. Mesereau: And to your knowledge, he actually did go to Brazil, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: I can't testify to that, Mr. Mesereau. Sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. You never learned one way or the other?
Cynthia Montgomery: I can't recall if he did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know someone named Cindy Bell?
Cynthia Montgomery: I do.
Mr. Mesereau: And who is Cindy Bell?
Cynthia Montgomery: She's a flight attendant for Xtra Jet.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you ever make arrangements for Mr. Jackson to fly anywhere with Cindy Bell?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And what are you referring to?
Cynthia Montgomery: A flight -- she was a stewardess on one of his flights.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you met her personally?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you spoken to her on the phone?
Cynthia Montgomery: I have.
Mr. Mesereau: And you've also spoken to Lauren Wallace on the phone, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And have you met Lauren Wallace personally?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, I believe your lawsuit against Mr. Jackson has to do with your using your credit card to pay for the Xtra Jet flight that he was secretly videotaped on; is that correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: What is your suit against Mr. Jackson for; how much money?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe the suit is for $50,000.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And aren't you claiming in the suit that you charged on your credit card costs that were -- should have been borne by Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, what are you --
Cynthia Montgomery: There's no credit card in question here.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you pay for a flight involving Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And how did you pay for that flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: In cash.
Mr. Mesereau: And was that the flight where he was secretly videotaped?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you actually go to Xtra Jet and give them cash?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And where did you go to Xtra Jet and pay cash?
Cynthia Montgomery: Santa Monica, California.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you go to their offices?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you personally arranged for that flight, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you get a receipt from Xtra Jet?
Cynthia Montgomery: I -- I'm not sure. I probably did. At that time --
Mr. Mesereau: Are you saying -- excuse me. Are you saying you handed $50,000 in cash to Xtra Jet?
Cynthia Montgomery: No, I didn't say that. I hand -- the lawsuit is a different amount than what I gave Xtra Jet.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you suing Mr. Jackson because you claim you should be reimbursed by Mr. Jackson for money you spent on his behalf?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And was the money you claim you spent on his behalf cash that you paid?
Cynthia Montgomery: I have paid part of it, I did that day, part of it in cash.
Mr. Mesereau: You say part of it in cash?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you give Xtra Jet that cash?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Who did you give the cash to at Xtra Jet?
Cynthia Montgomery: Jeffrey Bohr.
Mr. Mesereau: And who is he?
Cynthia Montgomery: The owner of Xtra Jet.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And was he a friend of yours?
Cynthia Montgomery: I would say more of a business associate.
Mr. Mesereau: And you went to Santa Monica to have a meeting with him, true?
Mr. Nicola: Objection. Relevance, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you suing Mr. Jackson for money you paid in cash?
Mr. Nicola: Objection, Your Honor. This is -- asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you suing Mr. Jackson for charges you made on a credit card?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Nicola: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled. Next question.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How long have you had a relationship with the company Xtra Jet?
Cynthia Montgomery: Um, for a couple of years.
Mr. Mesereau: And who has been your primary contact at the company called Xtra Jet?
Cynthia Montgomery: Brian -- at the time it was Brian Kranitz.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And it was your recommendation that Mr. Jackson fly with Xtra Jet, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, it was certainly your recommendation that he fly on Xtra Jet on the day he was secretly videotaped, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's true.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, on that particular day when Mr. Jackson was secretly videotaped on Xtra Jet, you also flew on a different Xtra Jet flight, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And on that particular day, Mr. Jackson was flying from Las Vegas to Santa Barbara, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you flew on a separate Xtra Jet flight from Las Vegas to Santa Barbara; is that correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes. In part.
Mr. Mesereau: And other people were with you on your particular flight on Xtra Jet on that day, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you arrange for those people to be on that flight with you?
Cynthia Montgomery: Only one.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you learn at some point that photographers were on that flight that you were on?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. To your knowledge, were any media people on the flight that you were on?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Nicola: Objection, relevance, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled. The answer is in. “No”. Next question.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor has showed you some itineraries that you've testified you used in your business of making flight arrangements for Mr. Jackson, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And I believe you said that 99 percent of the time Evvy would give you the information you needed to make those flight arrangements, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And your understanding was that you would make the flight reservations for Mr. Jackson, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You'd also make the reservations for others who traveled with Mr. Jackson, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: I would -- she would give me the manifest with their names on it.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. And you would ensure that all of those individuals were allowed to be on the flight that you booked, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: It was an FAA requirement. I had no -- I couldn't allow or disallow anything.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, but the plans for Mr. Jackson and others to fly were primarily made by you, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: I was -- I submitted -- I was given a list, I submitted a list, and I had no control of who was on that flight.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, I don't mean to suggest that. But certainly if you were told by Evvy --
Cynthia Montgomery: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: -- that she would like you to make a flight reservation for whatever it may be, let's say five people, you would arrange for all those five people to be on a particular flight, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And would the cost billed by Xtra Jet go up the more people that were on the flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: It was a set fee each time, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: So if Mr. Jackson were with two people or six people, it made no difference in terms of cost, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Other than the catering, it made no difference.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And would you arrange the catering as well?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And are you the person who would arrange for a particular type of food to be served on the flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And how were you compensated for making these arrangements?
Cynthia Montgomery: Xtra Jet would bill me back.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And what was your understanding with Xtra Jet as far as what you would be billed?
Cynthia Montgomery: It was discussed prior to making the reservations.
Mr. Mesereau: Would you -- excuse me. Let me rephrase that. Did you have a set fee that you would be billed by Xtra Jet or did you negotiate it differently for each flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: Well, each destination carries its own price --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Cynthia Montgomery: -- depending on where he was going.
Mr. Mesereau: So there was a -- in effect, a form or schedule of what the cost of the flight would be, depending on where it went, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: And how were you compensated?
Cynthia Montgomery: I received commission.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And would the commission be a percentage of the total cost of the flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: Usually, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Now, if Xtra Jet sent you a bill, would you then typically forward that bill to whoever you thought should pay it?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you've indicated that you sent some bills to MJJ Productions, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you sent some bills to Neverland Valley Entertainment, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you some questions about who owns those companies, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't have any idea whatsoever who actually owns stock or any other interest in Neverland Valley Entertainment, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: I wouldn't say that that's true at all. I would say I was told about Neverland Valley Entertainment.
Mr. Mesereau: Only by Mr. Schaffel, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And certainly it was always your understanding that Mr. Schaffel was trying to promote a relationship with Michael Jackson for his own benefit, true?
Mr. Nicola: Objection. Calls for speculation, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You never spoke to Mr. Jackson about whether he owned any interest whatsoever in Neverland Valley Entertainment, did you?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Your information about Neverland Valley Entertainment came primarily from Mr. Schaffel, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: And one of the bookkeepers.
Mr. Mesereau: How long would you say you were a friend of Mr. Schaffel?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe I said almost 20 years.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you know whether or not Mr. Schaffel would try and get reimbursed for anything his company allegedly spent for Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have knowledge that Mr. Schaffel would sometimes send bills to Mr. Jackson's accountants?
Mr. Nicola: Objection. Relevance; calls for speculation; lack of foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer “yes” or “no”.
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I have knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you have any knowledge at the time that Mr. Schaffel was sending bills to Mr. Jackson's accountants for money allegedly spent on the Arvizos?
Mr. Nicola: Objection, Your Honor. That lacks a foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn whether or not Mr. Schaffel was sending bills to Mr. Jackson's accountants seeking reimbursement for money he claimed he spent on the Arvizos?
Mr. Nicola: Your Honor, that calls for speculation. Lacks foundation.
The Court: Overruled.
Cynthia Montgomery: I know that he -- I'm sorry. I have some knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me?
Cynthia Montgomery: I have some knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When you sent bills to Neverland Valley Entertainment, your understanding was that Mr. Schaffel owned some interest in that company, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: And you also knew that Mr. Schaffel was sending bills to Mr. Jackson's accountants on behalf of Neverland Valley Entertainment claiming he was owed reimbursement, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you say, as you sit here today, you've never learned Mr. Schaffel has sued Mr. Jackson claiming he's owed millions?
Mr. Nicola: Objection, Your Honor. That's argumentative, calls for speculation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor showed you some documents involving travel plans that came to you from Evvy Tavasci, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And your understanding was that Evvy Tavasci was a personal assistant to Mr. Jackson, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And she was employed by MJJ Productions, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: As far as I understood, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And your understanding was that MJJ Productions was a company owned by Michael Jackson, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you would often make travel arrangements for Mr. Jackson and members of his family, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you meet other members of his family at any time, to your knowledge?
Cynthia Montgomery: Um, cousins.
Mr. Mesereau: And who were they?
Cynthia Montgomery: Elijah Jackson. People that were in Vegas.
Mr. Mesereau: And to your knowledge, who was Elijah Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe to be a cousin or a nephew.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever meet Grace Rwaramba?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And where did you meet Grace Rwaramba?
Cynthia Montgomery: Officially on the tarmac in Santa Barbara.
Mr. Mesereau: And your understanding was that she was a nanny for Mr. Jackson's --
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: -- children, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever meet his children?
Cynthia Montgomery: I don't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: How about Levon Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: I can't recall that either.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How about P.K. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's one of the children.
Mr. Mesereau: P.M. Jackson? Never met them?
Cynthia Montgomery: To the best of my knowledge, no. Best of my recollection, no.
Mr. Mesereau: You met the nanny but not the children, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And how about Patricia Chavez?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: But you remember booking flights for these individuals, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: The names are very familiar.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Cynthia Montgomery: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall making any special arrangements for the dietary needs of his children?
Cynthia Montgomery: Diet -- special dietary needs. Just what Evvy would tell me to order.
Mr. Mesereau: So pretty much she made those decisions, not you?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: She'd forward the information to you, you would then call Xtra Jet and arrange for it to happen; is that right?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. When did you last book a flight for Mr. Jackson, to your knowledge?
Cynthia Montgomery: November 19th, 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you ever remember booking flights for the Cascio family?
Cynthia Montgomery: I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever meet the Cascio family?
Cynthia Montgomery: Just the son.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Ever meet the parents?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, are you the only one in your family suing Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Is it you individually, or your company, or both?
Cynthia Montgomery: As an individual.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. The company did not sue Mr. Jackson; is that true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, that's true.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did you file that suit, if you know?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe 2004.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it filed in Los Angeles?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, is the case currently going forward?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Are you familiar with an individual named Michelle Christina?
Cynthia Montgomery: Not that I recall.
Mr. Mesereau: How about a company called Oneness, O-n-e-n-e-s-s?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did you first become familiar with a company called Oneness?
Mr. Nicola: I'm going to object, Your Honor. It doesn't appear to be relevant. It's beyond the scope of direct.
Mr. Mesereau: I will -- I will tie it up, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: You get involved in charitable fund-raisers from time to time, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that part of what your travel company does?
Cynthia Montgomery: I donate through my travel company.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you ever help to arrange charitable fund-raisers?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And is that one of the things your company does?
Cynthia Montgomery: Like I just said, I donate travel for charities.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you became familiar with a company Oneness while doing just that, right?
Mr. Nicola: I'm going to renew my objection, Your Honor, on relevance grounds.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you claiming that because Mr. Jackson owes you money, you're not going to pay a company called Oneness?
Mr. Nicola: Objection. Your Honor, there's --
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: How many fund-raisers have you been involved in for Marc Schaffel?
Cynthia Montgomery: One.
Mr. Mesereau: Just one?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Have you ever assisted in promoting Mr. Schaffel's company in any way?
Mr. Nicola: I'm going to object. Your Honor, this is not relevant.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Cynthia Montgomery: I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever assisted Mr. Schaffel in any public relations efforts involving his company?
Cynthia Montgomery: “His company” being Neverland Valley?
Mr. Mesereau: Any company he owns.
Cynthia Montgomery: Not that I -- I mean, I'm not sure I'm understanding where -- what the question is. Have I promoted his company?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Cynthia Montgomery: I would say no to that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But the fund-raiser you claim you met Mr. Jackson at was a fund-raiser arranged by Mr. Schaffel, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were assisting him with that, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Were you assisting him in raising money?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you done that on other occasions?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times have you assisted Marc Schaffel in raising money, to your knowledge?
Cynthia Montgomery: Just that one time.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm sorry if I misunderstood.
Cynthia Montgomery: Just that one time.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Never on any other occasion?
Cynthia Montgomery: Not that I'm aware of.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Have you ever had any kind of a financial interest in any projects involving Mr. Schaffel?
Mr. Nicola: Objection, Your Honor. It's vague, lacks a foundation and not relevant.
Mr. Mesereau: Bias, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever done any business with Mr. Schaffel other than arranging flights and helping him with that one fund-raiser?
Cynthia Montgomery: Not to my knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you first meet with any representative of the prosecution about your testimony?
Cynthia Montgomery: Sometime in the year 2004.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you contacted by any representative of the prosecution for purposes of that meeting?
Cynthia Montgomery: I received a phone call.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And who called you?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe it was Lieutenant Jeff Klapakis.
Mr. Mesereau: And how many meetings do you think you've had before today with any member of the prosecution to discuss this case?
Cynthia Montgomery: Specifically the prosecution or the detectives?
Mr. Mesereau: Let's start with the prosecution.
Cynthia Montgomery: I met with them -- I just met them last week.
Mr. Mesereau: For the first time?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you with your attorney?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you first notify the prosecution that you would not testify in this trial unless you were granted legal immunity?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did not do that.
Mr. Mesereau: Who did it?
Cynthia Montgomery: My attorney.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know when he first did that?
Cynthia Montgomery: I can't be certain of that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you have any idea at all?
Cynthia Montgomery: I think it was Thursday maybe.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Cynthia Montgomery: I have no idea.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever personally, on your own initiative, call any sheriff to give information about Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did you do that?
Cynthia Montgomery: After I saw the 60 Minutes Ed Bradley special.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you then meet with any representative with the sheriff's department?
Cynthia Montgomery: Not at that time, no.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times have you personally called the sheriff's department to volunteer information about Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: About Mr. Jackson?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Cynthia Montgomery: I couldn't tell you a number.
Mr. Mesereau: How many interviews do you think you've had with any representative of the sheriff's department about Mr. Jackson?
Cynthia Montgomery: Several.
Mr. Mesereau: How many do you think?
Cynthia Montgomery: In person, three or four.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever had any discussion with anyone about what you were going to say in court today linked to the prosecution?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Who?
Cynthia Montgomery: Mr. Nicola and the sergeant and the lieutenant.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you discuss with Mr. Nicola what questions you were going to be asked in court?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you and he discuss what your responses were going to be?
Cynthia Montgomery: To tell the truth.
Mr. Mesereau: Say anything more than that?
Cynthia Montgomery: Just tell the truth. Be honest.
Mr. Mesereau: That's all he said, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: To relax.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So he went over questions he was going to ask you, and all you said in response was, “I'll tell the truth, I'll tell the truth”, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: To answer the questions pertaining to the evidence that I am responsible for doing, correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever discuss with Mr. Nicola of the prosecution the fact that you had legal immunity?
Cynthia Montgomery: After my attorney called him, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you and he ever go over what legal immunity means?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes. We touched on it.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did you do that?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe that day, Thursday.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that would be last Thursday, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you and he discuss any document that gave you legal immunity from being prosecuted for what you said in court?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you and your attorney ever meet with Mr. Nicola regarding your grant of legal immunity?
Cynthia Montgomery: Mr. Nicola was introduced to my attorney yesterday morning for the first time. I wasn't privy to their conversation.
Mr. Mesereau: So you'd never had a meeting with Mr. Nicola and your attorney present, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Not a meeting, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. To your knowledge, have you ever been involved in any secretly recorded telephone conversations concerning this case?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How many conversations, to your knowledge, have you been involved in that were secretly recorded?
Cynthia Montgomery: One.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know that conversation was going to be recorded?
Cynthia Montgomery: I was asked to record it, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that by the representatives of the sheriff's department?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you call someone knowing that that call was going to be secretly recorded?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And approximately when was that?
Cynthia Montgomery: 2004, the beginning -- I'm not sure. I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you have any idea?
Cynthia Montgomery: Not without reviewing documents, no, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. The round trip that you -- excuse me, let me try and find the right word. You and Mr. Schaffel discussed a round trip to Brazil involving the Arvizos, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you put together an itinerary for that round trip, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: I made a reservation for that trip.
Mr. Mesereau: And in the course of making the reservation, you actually had an itinerary with dates, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: There was a departure date, true? And there was a return date, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: True.
Mr. Mesereau: The trip you were arranging was for how many people?
Cynthia Montgomery: Four.
Mr. Mesereau: You separately had arranged a Brazil trip for Mr. Schaffel, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You arranged a separate trip for Mr. Schaffel around the time that you and he discussed arranging a trip for the Arvizos, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you used to get tickets for Mr. Schaffel, how would you typically arrange to pay for those tickets?
Cynthia Montgomery: He would send me a check or put it on his credit card.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he ever send you a check involving a trip for the Arvizos?
Cynthia Montgomery: I couldn't tell you for sure. I'd have to look at documents.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, was there ever a charge made on any credit card for a trip to Brazil involving the Arvizos?
Cynthia Montgomery: Not to my knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And at no time did you ever arrange any trip to Brazil for Mr. Jackson, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's right.
Mr. Mesereau: And at no time did you ever speak to Mr. Jackson on the phone about any trip to Brazil, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: I've never spoken to Mr. Jackson on the telephone.
Mr. Mesereau: And you've never spoken to him in person about any trip to Brazil at any time?
Cynthia Montgomery: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: I have no further questions at this time.
The Court: Counsel?
Mr. Nicola: Thank you, Your Honor.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. NICOLA:
Mr. Nicola: Mrs. Montgomery, did you actually review the Judge's order granting you use immunity during the break?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And do you understand use immunity does not protect you from lying on the witness stand; isn't that correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Absolutely.
Mr. Nicola: You indicated with respect to the events of November 20th of 2004 -- 2003. Thank you for that -- with respect to the events of November 20th, 2003, you've cooperated with the FBI?
Cynthia Montgomery: I have on several occasions.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And was it your idea to request immunity in this case?
Cynthia Montgomery: No, it was not.
Mr. Nicola: It was your attorney's?
Cynthia Montgomery: Absolutely -- yes.
Mr. Nicola: Were you present in court yesterday when immunity for you was discussed amongst all the attorneys and the Judge?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I was.
Mr. Nicola: Did your attorney actually object to that?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, he did.
Mr. Nicola: Again, was that your idea or his?
Cynthia Montgomery: It was his idea.
Mr. Nicola: You mentioned that you contacted law enforcement for the first time after seeing an Ed Bradley 60 Minutes interview?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I did.
Mr. Nicola: Was that broadcast on television?
Cynthia Montgomery: It was.
Mr. Nicola: Was there something about that that caused you to pick up the phone and call the police?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Nicola: You may answer.
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes. A statement Mr. Jackson made.
Mr. Nicola: What was that statement?
Cynthia Montgomery: That he was mishandled by the authorities upon his arrest.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Overruled. It's redirect of questions you asked.
Mr. Nicola: Would you answer that question again? I believe you were cut off.
The Court: I'll just have the question and statement read back. Read the question and answer, please.
The Court Reporter: What was that statement? That he was mishandled by the authorities upon his arrest.
Mr. Nicola: Were you present at his arrest scene?
Cynthia Montgomery: I was -- yes. When he was put into handcuffs, yes, I was.
Mr. Nicola: Was that the tail end of that November 20th flight in 2003?
Cynthia Montgomery: It was close to the tail end of it.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And you witnessed the events?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Nicola: Felt what Mr. Jackson said on the television was not true?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Move to strike; foundation.
The Court: Sustained. It's stricken.
Mr. Nicola: Did you see Mr. Jackson being mishandled by anybody?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Relevance; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Nicola: Could you tell us on approximately how many occasions you contacted Lieutenant Klapakis?
Cynthia Montgomery: How many times I contacted him? Through the course of this investigation?
Mr. Nicola: Yes.
Cynthia Montgomery: Many.
Mr. Nicola: You talk to him frequently, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: I do.
Mr. Nicola: And did you always relay to him information that you had firsthand knowledge of?
Cynthia Montgomery: I did.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Did you also relay to him things that you had heard from other sources?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, I did.
Mr. Nicola: Did you ever actively try to hide anything from Lieutenant Klapakis when he inquired with you about facts you may know about the case?
Cynthia Montgomery: No, I did not.
Mr. Nicola: Did you hide anything from the FBI when they interviewed you about the November 20th flight?
Cynthia Montgomery: No, I did not.
Mr. Nicola: I'd like to clean something up in your cross-examination. You actually testified that the flight arrangements you made for the Arvizos to Brazil occurred in 2001. That actually occurred in 2003?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, it did.
Mr. Nicola: Could you take a look at Exhibit No. 848 again, please, and just confirm that?
Cynthia Montgomery: February 25th, 2003.
Mr. Nicola: And the day of their flight was March 2nd?
Cynthia Montgomery: March 1st of 2003.
Mr. Nicola: And you indicated on cross-examination that at some point Mr. Schaffel called you and said there was a change of plans regarding the Arvizos' trip?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, he did.
Mr. Nicola: Do you recall his tone of voice when he spoke with you?
Cynthia Montgomery: I'm not sure I recall his tone of voice.
Mr. Nicola: Do you recall anything about that conversation that caused you to take particular note of it?
Cynthia Montgomery: Normal for Schaffel's behavior.
Mr. Nicola: Normal behavior for Mr. Schaffel?
Cynthia Montgomery: Uh-huh. I would say yes to that.
Mr. Nicola: Is there anything that can help you pinpoint the date of when he contacted you and said there had been a change of plans?
Cynthia Montgomery: I don't recall a date that he would have told me to cancel the reservations.
Mr. Nicola: Do you know even whether that occurred after the flight was scheduled to leave?
Cynthia Montgomery: Reservations, if you don't ticket, will fall out of the computer system after -- 24 hours after the scheduled departure date.
Mr. Nicola: Is there any indication on Exhibit 847 of a cancellation date?
Cynthia Montgomery: 848?
Mr. Nicola: 848, I'm sorry.
Cynthia Montgomery: No. They were never physically cancelled.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. The information regarding the address for Mrs. Arvizo --
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: -- Mr. Schaffel give you that address?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Would you read that whole address into the record for us, please?
Cynthia Montgomery: Ms. Janet Arvizo, 11520 Trent Court, Calabasas, California 91302.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And he gave you each part of that address?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: To your knowledge, and with your experience in dealing with securing visas for clients that travel outside of the country, do you know the different levels of visas that are available for travel into Brazil specifically?
Cynthia Montgomery: You have to call each consulate every time you book into a country, find out the specific needs.
Mr. Nicola: And with your contact specifically with respect to Brazil and Mr. Schaffel traveling down there, did you have knowledge from your contacts with the consulate as to whether they issued 30- or 60- or 90-day visas?
Cynthia Montgomery: I called to inquire at the time I made the reservations, yes.
Mr. Nicola: So you called to inquire on the Arvizos' reservation as well?
Cynthia Montgomery: I called because they needed passports, so I needed to know how --
Mr. Nicola: Do you recall what the length of the visa was they were requesting?
Cynthia Montgomery: I don't recall that.
Mr. Nicola: If you asked for a 30-day visa, but you overextend your stay, do you know what happens?
Cynthia Montgomery: Well, if -- customs, if they catch you, they will kick you out of the country.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. But they have to catch you first?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes. They would catch you trying to depart the country, actually. They would see that your visa had expired, if it did expire.
Mr. Nicola: You mentioned that you secretly recorded one telephone conversation. Do you recall which detective asked you to do that?
Cynthia Montgomery: Two detectives. One lieutenant, one sergeant.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And was that something that you did willingly?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: They didn't pressure you or threaten some kind of prosecution against you if you didn't do that?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Nicola: Has anybody at this table, anybody you've met from law enforcement or the prosecution, ever threatened you or tried to coerce you and get you to say anything that was not truthful?
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Nicola: Does this grant of use immunity protect you from lying on the witness stand?
Cynthia Montgomery: No, it does not.
Mr. Nicola: Do you understand if you do, you can be prosecuted for perjury, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes, correct.
Mr. Nicola: Your suit against Mr. Jackson, you are suing for the cost of the flight from Las Vegas to Santa Barbara, plus other expenses?
Cynthia Montgomery: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Your Honor, I have no further questions.
The Court: Mr. Mesereau?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you questions about what your attorney said in court yesterday, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were present yesterday when your attorney made those comments on your behalf, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Your attorney expressed a concern in open court that you might be prosecuted in Nevada, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe he said that.
Mr. Mesereau: Your attorney also expressed concerns that you might be prosecuted in federal court, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: I believe he said that.
Mr. Mesereau: And because of his fear that you might be prosecuted, he didn't want you to testify at all, correct?
Cynthia Montgomery: It's his job to do that.
Mr. Mesereau: Because of his fears that you would be prosecuted, he didn't want you testifying at all, true?
Cynthia Montgomery: I've had a conversation with my attorney. I don't believe he has any fears of my prosecution.
Mr. Mesereau: Did your attorney express concerns yesterday in this courthouse in your presence and on your behalf that you might be prosecuted in Nevada and also by federal authorities?
Mr. Nicola: Object. Objection, Your Honor, calls for hearsay and speculation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: It's a concern that you might be prosecuted that resulted in your demand for a legal immunity, true?
Mr. Nicola: Objection; misstates the evidence.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Cynthia Montgomery: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Your position yesterday in this courtroom was, “If I don't get immunity, I don't testify”, right?
Cynthia Montgomery: That was my attorney's position.
Mr. Mesereau: But you had nothing to do with that?
Mr. Nicola: Objection, that's argumentative, Your Honor. Calls for hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.

Mr. Nicola: Did she explain to you how the address for Janet Arvizo was placed on that bill and who the source of the information for that was?

Mr. Sanger: Objection.
Mr. Nicola: It's a “yes” or “no” question.
Mr. Sanger: I'll withdraw it, as long as he goes no further.

Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Does the address listed on 848 for Janet Arvizo in Calabasas exist?

Mr. Nicola: Nothing further.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: You were the officer who first had a formal interview with Miss Montgomery; is that correct?
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And that was on January 13th, 2004?
Jeff Klapakis: Well, my first contact with her was in November of .03.
Mr. Sanger: Oh, that's true. Okay. As far as a formal interview, though, you didn't have a formal interview until that time?
Jeff Klapakis: I've had several interviews with her. I'm not quite sure of the date, sir.
Mr. Sanger: You were aware that prior to that, she had called and volunteered some information. She had talked to somebody else in the sheriff's department; is that right?
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And as a result of her calling and volunteering information, you then called and talked to her?
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you had a rather extensive interview with her; is that correct?
Jeff Klapakis: Phone interview, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Phone interview. And following that, arrangements were made to meet with her on January 22nd, 2004, correct?
Jeff Klapakis: I believe it was in January. But I'm not quite sure of the date.
Mr. Sanger: And that was a date in which you met with her and with her attorney, Robert Moore; is that right?
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And she then volunteered information about Mr. Schaffel; is that right?
Jeff Klapakis: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And she volunteered information about other people associated with Mr. Schaffel; is that correct?
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And she offered to make a pretext telephone call to one of those people; is that correct?
Jeff Klapakis: She did agree to do that, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And she made the call and it was tape-recorded for the benefit of the sheriff's department; is that right?
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: I have no further questions.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. NICOLA:
Mr. Nicola: To your knowledge, Lieutenant, are members of police agencies investigating crimes or their agents - for example, citizens who agree to work with them - allowed to tape-record telephone conversations during the course of an investigation?
Mr. Sanger: I'm going to object to the form of the question. Calls for speculation, and/or irrelevant information.
The Court: Overruled.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes, they are.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Nothing further.
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: All right. So just to clarify that, under -- your understanding of California law is that if law enforcement, a peace officer, authorizes somebody to make a call and tape-record it, that that permits them then to do so; is that right?
Jeff Klapakis: That is my understanding of California law.
Mr. Sanger: In other words, it would be unlawful otherwise for just an ordinary citizen to tape-record a telephone conversation without the consent of both parties to the conversation; is that right?
Jeff Klapakis: That's correct. You need law enforcement direction.
Mr. Sanger: Yes. So there's a law enforcement exception to that rule - all right?
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- that allows -- that allows law enforcement to tape-record in California, to tape-record a conversation without the consent of the other party, correct?
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And that's been interpreted to allow a law enforcement officer to empower another person, a civilian, to make a call and tape-record it without the consent of the other party as long as law enforcement said it was okay; is that right?
Jeff Klapakis: That is my understanding of California law, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And in this particular case, did you -- did your office -- whether it was you in particular or not, did your office participate in making this pretext call that was tape-recorded?
Jeff Klapakis: I participated in it.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So this wasn't just saying, “If you want to tape-record somebody, go do it”. It was you actually sitting there getting the tape-recorder set up on the phone and having her place the call in your presence; is that right?
Jeff Klapakis: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And it was your understanding at that time that she was attempting to be helpful in the case against Mr. Jackson; is that right?
Jeff Klapakis: She was helpful in this investigation, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. No further questions.
Mr. Nicola: No further questions, Your Honor.
The Court: You may step down. Call your next witness.

Hamid Moslehi: I do still photography and video production.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what training and experience have you had that qualifies you to -- for that profession?
Hamid Moslehi: Training; like what do you mean by that?
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, I mean, what is your background that qualifies you for that position, to be a professional photographer and videographer?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I majored in art directing, actually. But then now I started, like, experience hands-on in photography, and then I got into video production, so I became one.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. How long have you been a professional photographer/videographer?
Hamid Moslehi: Since 1990 I would say.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. The microphone I'm going to have you use is the one on the left there, okay?
Hamid Moslehi: Sorry.

Hamid Moslehi: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you say “documentaries”, are you talking about videos?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: What about production of videos? Editing, this type of thing? Do you participate in that activity?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure. I do, like, pre-production, and then production, and post-production, which contains some editing work.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. What are the distinctions between pre-editing --
Hamid Moslehi: Pre-production is mostly planning for the production. Production, it's the shooting itself. And post-production is editing it and putting the final touches together.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you have any employees for your business?
Hamid Moslehi: I hire, like, independent contractors.
Mr. Auchincloss: On an as-needed basis or --
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you ever -- well, let me back up. How do you work with an individual who hires you in terms of the legal arrangement? Do you ever act as an employee?
Hamid Moslehi: No. They're mostly independent contractor. Basically they work per project. So I give them a call, check their schedule. If they are available, then I book them.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what type of independent contractors do you use? What --
Hamid Moslehi: Freelance people mostly.
Mr. Auchincloss: But specifically what tasks do you assign them?
Hamid Moslehi: It could be sound, it could be assisting, it could be lighting, grip, all sort of thing.
Mr. Auchincloss: What's a grip?
Hamid Moslehi: A grip is the guy who put, like, stands together or, you know, carries heavy equipment around, and things like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you ever been contracted by MJJ Productions for any of your photography work?
Hamid Moslehi: MJJ Production has used my services from 1996, I believe, till 2003.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what type of services have you provided to MJJ Productions?
Hamid Moslehi: Still photography and video production.
Mr. Auchincloss: How many projects have you worked on with MJJ Productions?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say between maybe 40 to 50 projects.
Mr. Auchincloss: And if you can tell me, give me an example, or a couple of examples, of the nature of the work that you do for MJJ Productions.
Hamid Moslehi: Could you be more specific to that? Like --
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, do you ever receive still photography assignments?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: What type?
Hamid Moslehi: It could have been a birthday party. It could have been family portrait pictures. It could have been concert.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Or documentaries.
Mr. Auchincloss: Same question for videography.
Hamid Moslehi: Same.
Mr. Auchincloss: Same answers?
Hamid Moslehi: Same answers.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. When you work for MJJ Productions, how do you become aware that there is a job for you there? Who informs you that MJJ Productions wants to employ your services?
Hamid Moslehi: Typically I would get a call from Mr. Jackson's personal assistant at MJJ Production. And basically I would check my schedule. Upon my availability, I would book that job and take it from there.
Mr. Auchincloss: What do you understand MJJ Productions to be?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe it's Michael Joe Jackson Productions.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Michael Jackson's production company?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And when you say “Michael Jackson”, you're referring to the gentleman seated in -- at the table to my right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when you shoot video work, what type of documentaries? You mentioned that you would shoot video documentaries. Give me an example.
Hamid Moslehi: For example, Mr. Jackson would take a trip to London to do -- for, like, a fund-raising event. And I would shoot basically fans, media, everything that goes around it. And including the event itself.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would Mr. Jackson ever personally call you to set up one of these contracts that you'd do for him?
Hamid Moslehi: Maybe a few times.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And when I say “contract”, I mean you're a contractor, contracted employment?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you ever do any public relations type of photography for Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: In what sense? Like --
Mr. Auchincloss: Videos or still photographs that were going to be used for public relations purposes.
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: How many times, if you can approximate?
Hamid Moslehi: Maybe 20, 25.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you interact with Mr. Jackson when you were shooting those projects?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: Can you tell me what his level of interest was and involvement -- well, let's start with his interest. When you did those projects, can you characterize how involved -- let's strike that question. We'll go right to involvement. How involved would Mr. Jackson be with you when you would be shooting a project that was for public relations purposes?
Hamid Moslehi: How involved? Like what --
Mr. Auchincloss: Would he interact with you?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what would his level of interaction be in terms of what he wanted concerning the specific project?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you understand the question?
Hamid Moslehi: Please repeat that question one more time.
Mr. Auchincloss: My question is, what would his level of interaction be with you regarding the video project that you're shooting for public relations purposes?
Hamid Moslehi: Mostly technical. Like lighting, camera angles.
Mr. Auchincloss: He would talk to you about that?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Would he tell you what angles he wanted?
Hamid Moslehi: He would look at the monitor and then make some suggestions as to what he likes it to be.
Mr. Auchincloss: What about the finished product? Would he be interested or involved with you concerning what the finished project would look like?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure. Sometimes.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Were you ever present when he was shooting a music video?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was -- was he involved in that process, if you know?
Hamid Moslehi: Of the story? Or --
Mr. Auchincloss: The shooting of it. How involved would he be with the part of the project that you observed?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sure he would be involved with the director as far as the story of the music video, and also with the director of photography for the look of the picture.
Mr. Auchincloss: As far as the finished product would go, can you characterize Mr. Jackson's level of interest in terms of how that finished product would come out?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: Very perfectionist, I would say.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And why do you say he's a perfectionist?
Hamid Moslehi: Because he would make comments that would make sense, changes, and using a level of perfectionism I would say.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you familiar with a project that was -- that involved Martin Bashir that was entitled, “Living with Michael Jackson”?
Hamid Moslehi: Say that, your question, one more time.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are you aware --
Hamid Moslehi: Oh, yes, I am.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- of a video called “Living with Michael Jackson”, a documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: I am.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if Mr. Jackson was involved in the production part of that documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: Production of it?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Meaning --
Mr. Auchincloss: The cutting, the editing. I'm talking about the whole production. Do you understand the word “production”?
Hamid Moslehi: I do understand the word “production”.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: When you say “involved”, because Mr. Jackson was the subject of this documentary.
Mr. Auchincloss: I know.
Hamid Moslehi: Now, technically, was he involved technically with it?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: In some level.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what level was he involved?
Hamid Moslehi: Mostly the look of the camera and the picture.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And did you participate at all in the making of that video production?
Hamid Moslehi: The Martin Bashir, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: In what capacity?
Hamid Moslehi: I was called from Mr. Jackson's office to come to Neverland and supervise a production or a shoot that is taking place by Martin Bashir. I was -- usually my duties are to make sure that Mr. Jackson looks good in that monitor or a picture of it. That includes camera angles, lighting, other technical things. And that's what my involvement was for that documentary.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. What does the term “personal videographer” mean?
Hamid Moslehi: A personal videographer would be someone who creates video images for another person.
Mr. Auchincloss: And is it uncommon in the world of celebrities for celebrities to have their own personal videographer?
Hamid Moslehi: Actually, it's called a personal DP. This stands for Director of Photography.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Hamid Moslehi: It is common that celebrities have their own DP that they bring on a shoot, because that person is familiar with that, with the image of that celebrity, and it could help to create a good-looking picture.
Mr. Auchincloss: And during the period of time that you worked as a contractor for Mr. Jackson, were you his personal DP?
Hamid Moslehi: I worked on certain projects that I acted as a personal DP for Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there anybody else during that time who was working with him as a personal DP?
Mr. Mesereau: Vague as to time.
Mr. Auchincloss: That's fair.
Mr. Auchincloss: During -- I believe you said that you began working with him in .97?
Hamid Moslehi: 1996.
Mr. Auchincloss: 1996. And when did you finish, stop working with him?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe early 2003.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So during that period, are you aware if he had any other personal DPs?
Hamid Moslehi: At the beginning there was another gentleman that also had the same kind of position.
Mr. Auchincloss: Uh-huh. And then at some point, did you become the only personal DP for Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: When did that occur?
Hamid Moslehi: I think towards .97. 1997.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So from .97 to 2003, were you Mr. Jackson's personal DP?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you ever travel with Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever go on tour with Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever go to places at Mr. Jackson's behest, at his request, to meet him and do video shoots?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Now, as far as the Martin Bashir video, you said that you participated in -- well, let me strike that. Did you participate as a personal DP in any of the video shoots involving Michael Jackson for the Martin Bashir special?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: How many?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sorry.
Mr. Auchincloss: Help yourself.
Hamid Moslehi: I think three sessions.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know the dates?
Hamid Moslehi: To my best memory, I think it was July 30th of 2002, July 31st of 2002, and the last session was mid-January of 2003.
Mr. Auchincloss: And on these individual shoots, what were your duties?
Hamid Moslehi: The very first session, I took some still photographs and I hired a crew to do like a behind-the-scenes footage.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where was this first one that occurred on July 30th? Where did that shoot take place?
Hamid Moslehi: At Neverland Valley Ranch.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. And you took some stills?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Any video shooting on that day?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you help out with that at all?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I hired a crew to do video and sound as a behind the scene, so, yes, there was a video and the still photography that day.
Mr. Auchincloss: And as far as the videographer for the actual special, the Martin Bashir special, did you do the video for that?
Hamid Moslehi: I helped Mr. Bashir's crew for lighting purposes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So Mr. Bashir had his own crew for that shot -- that shooting, and you assisted with lighting?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, yeah, my duty were to light Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you also help out with camera angles?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what's your goal when you try to assist in lighting and camera angles? What are you trying to do?
Hamid Moslehi: I try to make my subject the best that they can look.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. What occurred on the 31st -- first of all, let me back up. Where did that shoot occur?
Hamid Moslehi: The 31st?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Neverland Valley.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did you do at Neverland Valley on that date?
Hamid Moslehi: The second day, basically it was supposed to do just -- to be an interview only. So I helped Mr. Bashir's crew put up lighting. I did the lighting for Mr. Jackson. And I also recorded it on a separate camera.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you record anything on a separate camera the first day?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I had a crew the first day, which they were shooting behind-the-scene footage.
Mr. Auchincloss: So you had a separate camera both days?
Hamid Moslehi: They were different cameras, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And then you had another shoot in mid-January of .03. Where did that shoot occur?
Hamid Moslehi: Florida.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you -- and I take it you flew to Florida to make that appointment?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: How did you become aware that that -- on the trip to Florida, how did you become aware that your services were going to be requested?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe I received a call from Mr. Jackson's assistant from MJJ Productions, and they informed me that there's going to be another interview with Martin Bashir of Mr. Jackson in Florida.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And what did you do to help out on that particular shoot?
Hamid Moslehi: Mostly lighting for Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you do any behind-the-scenes video footage on that?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did some footage of behind the scene and still photos.
Mr. Auchincloss: During the course of your work for Mr. Jackson, have you ever shot any videotape of a family with the last name of Arvizo?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: On how many occasions?
Hamid Moslehi: Approximately three.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you remember the approximate month and year that those three video shoots took place or --
Hamid Moslehi: Each of them?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: I believe the first one was October of 2000. Or, I'm sorry, the first one was September 2000, if I remember correctly. The second was -- the second one was October of 2000, if I remember correctly. And I believe the last one was February 19 of 2003.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you present -- well, let me ask you, first of all, did you see the Martin Bashir special?
Hamid Moslehi: “Living with Michael Jackson”?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you see the segment in which Gavin Arvizo appears in that documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, there's two versions. There's an ABC version and a BBC version. I saw the ABC version.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: And I saw Gavin with Mr. Jackson in a scene.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you present when that scene was shot?
Hamid Moslehi: No, I was not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Let's go back to the first video that you did for Mr. Jackson on -- involving the Arvizo family. You said it was September 2000. What was that shoot about? First of all, tell me, if you can recall, who contacted you.
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, I received a call from MJJ Productions, Mr. Jackson's personal assistant, and they informed me that Mr. Jackson wants me to go to Neverland to shoot some footage.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you arrived at Neverland?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have any crew with you?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe I had one assistant, if I remember correctly.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did you do at Neverland on that particular occasion?
Hamid Moslehi: I was told by Mr. Jackson to get some footage of Gavin and him walking around at Neverland.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is that the first time you met Gavin?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you meet any other members of the Arvizo family on that trip?
Hamid Moslehi: His brother.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you recall his name?
Hamid Moslehi: Star.
Mr. Auchincloss: So tell me how you went about your task of getting video footage. How did that happen, specifically?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe I was told by Mr. Jackson to just get some coverage, footage of Mr. Jackson and Gavin walking around the Neverland.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were these shoots scripted at all?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: How did you go about getting this video footage?
Hamid Moslehi: I would basically decide what angle, how, where, you know, to shoot this footage.
Mr. Auchincloss: And who would decide the arrangement of the subjects and what the subjects would be doing?
Hamid Moslehi: Sometime Mr. Jackson will direct me as far as what shots he wants. But most of the time he would leave it up to me.
The Court: All right. Let's take our break.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Counsel?
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Moslehi, where we left off, we were talking about the September 2000 video that you shot of Gavin and Michael Jackson. Now, my last question really deals with the -- dealt more with the subject -- what the individual subjects of that video were doing. First of all, let me ask you, who were the individual subjects in that video?
Hamid Moslehi: Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Gavin. I believe there was a shot of three of them, with Star, the brother.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Anybody else who appeared in that video?
Hamid Moslehi: Not that I remember.
Mr. Auchincloss: And in terms of what Mr. Jackson was doing in that video, who decided that, what he was doing, in terms of whether he was standing in a place, walking, that kind of thing?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, Mr. Jackson asked me to shoot some footage, and while he was walking with Gavin, I will decide whether to get an over-the-shoulder shot, which is a back shot, or run in the front and get a front shot.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. I understand that you were in charge of shooting the photography, the video, and that you made a decision about camera angles, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: And but in terms of what Mr. Jackson was doing when you shot those photographs, did you direct him, or did Mr. Jackson do that on his own?
Hamid Moslehi: You mean the video, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes. What he was doing.
Hamid Moslehi: He was walking with Gavin, I guess.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you understand my question?
Hamid Moslehi: No, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who made that decision, what Mr. Jackson was doing, what he did in that video? Who decided --
Hamid Moslehi: Himself. Mr. Jackson himself.
Mr. Auchincloss: So you didn't tell him, “Go stand over there. And now I want you to walk across” --
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. He decided. Let's talk about the second video. You mentioned that was in October of the same year; is that right? 2000?
Hamid Moslehi: As I remember, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who were the subjects of that video?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, the video was a pilot. A pilot is like a little sample of an idea. Mr. Jackson -- well, I had a meeting with Mr. Jackson, and he informed me that he likes to do a program called “Neverland Channel”.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Which is like --
Mr. Auchincloss: So this was a little pilot --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. I don't think the witness completed his response, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: Then I believe we were getting nonresponsive. But --
The Court: Well, you can ask him another question. Go ahead.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. So going back to my original question, who were the subjects of that video?
Hamid Moslehi: The host of the video was Star, Gavin's brother.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And who else appeared in that video?
Hamid Moslehi: Some other kids, including Gavin, and some animals.
Mr. Auchincloss: How long did that video take to shoot?
Hamid Moslehi: A good 16-hour day it was.
Mr. Auchincloss: 16 hours?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah. One day.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Star exhibit any natural talent in terms of his ability to host this program?
Hamid Moslehi: “Natural talent” meaning?
Mr. Auchincloss: Talent.
Hamid Moslehi: Was he be able to do this right, or --
Mr. Auchincloss: Correct.
Hamid Moslehi: Not really.
Mr. Auchincloss: Tell me what you mean.
Hamid Moslehi: Well, first of all, dealing with kids and animal in production is really tough.
Mr. Auchincloss: Uh-huh.
Hamid Moslehi: But when you deal with both of them, is just another situation that it's really tough to shoot. Star did not have enough, I guess, rehearsal or talent to do this video right, so we had to take a lot of takes and that kind of thing. Is that what --
Mr. Auchincloss: Yeah, that's the question. For instance, how many takes would it take -- how many different takes would you run before you got a good shot of Star doing what you wanted him to do?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I -- if I remember correctly, I never ended up getting a really good shot that I was looking for. But it would take like 15 takes, maybe, just to get a little piece so I can probably fix it in editing and put a piece together.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. What were Star's shortcomings, if you could characterize them, in his ability to be the host of this program?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: May I answer?
The Court: You may.
Hamid Moslehi: Well, the way he was basically acting in front of a camera, and, you know, just like his skills, I guess. It wasn't -- it wasn't professional.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Were you the producer of this particular video?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Were there any other individuals who were involved in this, other than yourself?
Hamid Moslehi: Crew-wise? Like other --
Mr. Auchincloss: Any fashion.
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there a crew?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I hired a crew to shoot this.
Mr. Auchincloss: What about in the production of it? Was there anybody else who was involved in the production of it?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, production is like really the crew who shoot the footage, or sound, that kind of stuff. Is that what your question --
Mr. Auchincloss: I mean pre-production --
Hamid Moslehi: Oh, pre-production.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- production or post-production. Anybody else involved in any production aspect?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, the pre-production was mostly me and Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Production was me and my crew.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: And post-production was me.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Was Frank Cascio involved in this production at all?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, he was.
Mr. Auchincloss: In what fashion?
Hamid Moslehi: Co-producer.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what does that mean?
Hamid Moslehi: Like somebody who coordinates things. For example, he would practice with the talent, in this case Star, go through his lines. That kind of thing.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you say Mr. Jackson helped you with pre-production, what did you mean by that?
Hamid Moslehi: As I said, we had a meeting with -- I had a meeting with Mr. Jackson, and Mr. Jackson explained to me what he wants to create for this look, or for the story of it. So that's part of the pre-production.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you go through what was going to be said by Star or the individuals who were appearing?
Hamid Moslehi: With Mr. Jackson?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: I -- I don't think so.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you go through what the individual shoots would involve? Any specifics about what the program -- that program or pilot would be about?
Hamid Moslehi: We covered certain style of the coverage, if I remember correctly.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: With Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who is Frank Cascio?
Hamid Moslehi: Frank is a friend/associate of Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know Frank Cascio?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I do.
Mr. Auchincloss: How long have you known him?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe I saw him at the tour, which was 1996.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm sorry?
Hamid Moslehi: In 1996, Mr. Jackson did a tour. And if I remember correctly, Frank was there.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where was that tour?
Hamid Moslehi: It was a world tour.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you present during the entire tour?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I was.
Mr. Auchincloss: And where did that world tour go?
Hamid Moslehi: We went to a lot of different countries. I would say 40, 50 countries. 40, 50 countries.
Mr. Auchincloss: How long did the tour take?
Hamid Moslehi: It was a year -- well, eight months in a year-and-a-half period.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Mr. Cascio there the entire time?
Hamid Moslehi: On and off.
Mr. Auchincloss: What percentage of time would you say he was on the tour with Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say maybe 30 percent.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. I'd like to show you some photographs at this time. If I may approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Mr. Moslehi, I show you People's Exhibit 338. Can you identify that for me, please?
Hamid Moslehi: These are the Arvizo kids, or Star, Gavin and I believe Davellin.

Mr. Mesereau: No objection.
The Court: All right. They're admitted.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. You mentioned a few names that I'd like to ask you some questions about. And if I could have the Elmo, Your Honor. First of all, I'll show you People's Exhibit 844. Is that the photograph that you said you shot of Mr. Jackson and Frank Cascio?

Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And the individuals in the center of the photograph, you don't recognize them?
Hamid Moslehi: I do not.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Thank you. Okay. Mr. Moslehi, at some time during the early part of 2003, you said that -- well, let me strike that. In 2003, did you perform some video services for Michael Jackson in the early part of 2003?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: And I believe you, first of all, characterized that you did some assistance in the Martin Bashir documentary in January; is that correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Mid-January of 2003.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Subsequent to that, did you perform some more -- some additional video services for Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. And could you describe the first one? First, let me strike that. How many projects or individual shoots did you involve yourself in at the request of Mr. Jackson for the remainder of 2003?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say five or six projects.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Tell us about the first one. Tell me what -- first of all, what was the subject matter of the first shoot, the first of those shoots?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I believe the very first project, if I'm not wrong, it was the Martin Bashir, which was --
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: -- mid-January of 2003.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes. And what was the next one?
Hamid Moslehi: Next one, I believe, was a shoot in Florida which never took place.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Let's start with that one. Well, let me ask you this, first of all: Prior to that shoot in Florida, did you do any video -- any other video production between the shoot -- between going to Florida and the Martin Bashir documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm not sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Do you recall doing a video shoot on February 5th, 2003?
Hamid Moslehi: I think there was an interview with Debbie Rowe.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Where did that interview take place?
Hamid Moslehi: At Marc Schaffel's house. Calabasas.
Mr. Auchincloss: When did you first learn that that was a project that Mr. Jackson wanted you to shoot?
Hamid Moslehi: Maybe a day before.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who informed you of that?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm not sure. Could have been Mr. Jackson's personal assistant or his new managers.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Who were his new managers at that time?
Hamid Moslehi: Ronald and Dieter.
Mr. Auchincloss: When did you first learn that Ronald and Dieter were Michael Jackson's new managers?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe I had a meeting with them in late 2002. I would say November, December.
Mr. Auchincloss: Uh-huh.
Hamid Moslehi: And they informed me that they were going to take the management from, I guess, the beginning of the year.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. Jackson ever confirm that, that they were his new managers?
Hamid Moslehi: Not directly, but somehow indirectly.
Mr. Auchincloss: What do you mean?
Hamid Moslehi: Once I called Mr. Jackson to ask him a question, and he asked me to call Dieter.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did he indicate what -- who Dieter was, to why he wanted you to call Dieter?
Hamid Moslehi: Why Mr. Jackson wanted to know --
Mr. Auchincloss: Why Mr. Jackson wanted you to call Dieter. Did Mr. Jackson tell you?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I think Dieter had the answer for whatever question I had.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm not asking what you think. I'm asking you if Mr. Jackson told you why he wanted you to call Dieter.
Hamid Moslehi: He didn't specifically told me why, but he just advised me to call Dieter.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know what the subject matter was? Do you remember the subject matter of that conversation?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember.
Mr. Auchincloss: So you were instructed to do a video shoot of Debbie Rowe?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And where did that shoot take place?
Hamid Moslehi: At Mr. -- at Marc Schaffel's house.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who told you to show up at Marc Schaffel's home?
Hamid Moslehi: It could have been either Mr. Schaffel or Dieter.
Mr. Auchincloss: Just a moment. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Going back to this video shoot, what was the purpose of it?
Hamid Moslehi: The Debbie Rowe?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: I believe it was like a response for what the Martin Bashir documentary was about.
Mr. Auchincloss: Had the Martin Bashir documentary aired in the United States at that time?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't think so. I'm not sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, that documentary was aired on the 6th of February.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you see the Martin Bashir documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where did you see it? Where were you when you saw it?
Hamid Moslehi: I was in Florida.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you specifically remember whether you shot the Debbie Rowe footage before you went to Florida?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe, yes. The day before.
Mr. Auchincloss: The day before?
Hamid Moslehi: The day before.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. So whatever day you went to Florida, the day before that, you shot the Debbie Rowe footage?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Now, tell me, who was at Marc Schaffel's home at the time this footage was shot?
Hamid Moslehi: There was Debbie, another lady, the interviewer, which I forgot his name, Schaffel, Christian Robinson, me, and my crew.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what was Mr. Schaffel's role in this shoot?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe some sort of producer.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And specifically what did he do?
Hamid Moslehi: He would have, like, a questionnaire in his hand to let the interviewer -- what to ask.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did this questionnaire look like?
Hamid Moslehi: Pieces of paper.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did the interviewer -- who was the interviewer?
Hamid Moslehi: I forgot his name.
Mr. Auchincloss: This is the fellow you can't remember his name?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And the interviewer, did he have any paper in his hands when he was asking the questions?
Hamid Moslehi: During the interview, I don't remember seeing him having any paper in his hand.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would he ever confer with Mr. Schaffel about how this interview would proceed?
Hamid Moslehi: Prior to this shoot or during the shoot?
Mr. Auchincloss: At any time.
Hamid Moslehi: They had some interactions as far as, you know, what kind of questions to ask and so on.
Mr. Auchincloss: And how many times did they interact about how this interview was going to be conducted?
Hamid Moslehi: Approximately?
Mr. Auchincloss: If you can recall, yeah, approximately.
Hamid Moslehi: Six, seven times, maybe.
Mr. Auchincloss: How many times before the interview started did they have discussions of that nature?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm not sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: And this interview, after you finished shooting it, what did you do with the footage?
Hamid Moslehi: Mr. Schaffel took it.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he take it on that day?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: It was in video format?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So you said the next day after that shoot, you went to Florida?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: What city in Florida?
Hamid Moslehi: Miami.
Mr. Auchincloss: And why did you go to Florida?
Hamid Moslehi: I was informed that there's going to be some sort of video shoot.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who informed you of that?
Hamid Moslehi: Either Mr. Jackson's personal assistant or Dieter.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when you say his personal assistant, do you mean Evvy?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: How long has Evvy been his personal assistant, as far as you know?
Hamid Moslehi: Years. Maybe 15 years. Something like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. She was his personal assistant when you began in .96?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And were you informed of what the nature of this video shoot was going to involve in Florida?
Hamid Moslehi: No, I was not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you informed of what type of equipment you would need?
Hamid Moslehi: Video equipment.
Mr. Auchincloss: Anything else?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I usually take, like, my still camera, too.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have any employees with you?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So tell me the arrangements that you made before you left for Florida, if any.
Hamid Moslehi: Since I couldn't take anybody with me, if I remember correctly, I called a rental house, which they rent equipment and -- video equipment, and booked some equipment so when I get there, I have the proper equipment that I need. Then basically I grabbed all my equipment that I could carry by myself and flew to Florida.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where did you go when you arrived in Florida?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe one of Mr. Jackson's drivers picked me up and they drove me to Mr. Jackson's hotel.
Mr. Auchincloss: Which hotel was that?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember the name of the hotel.
Mr. Auchincloss: And where did you go when you arrived at the hotel?
Hamid Moslehi: To my room.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you meet with anybody at the hotel on that day?
Hamid Moslehi: I met with Dieter and Ronald that day.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where did that meeting take place?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe at their room.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did that meeting consist of? What was it a meeting about?
Hamid Moslehi: Mostly about just them taking over the management; they're the new managers, and the way they liked to conduct business from now on.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: And also we had discussion about my unpaid invoices.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you have some unpaid invoices at that time?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sorry?
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have some unpaid invoices --
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- that were owed by MJJ Productions?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What kind of figure are we talking about at that time? How much money was owed to you, approximately?
Hamid Moslehi: About $250,000.
Mr. Auchincloss: How long had you been owed that money?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, this was like a year and a half worth of unpaid invoices, so it kept adding up.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would you bill as the invoices would accrue?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sorry?
Mr. Auchincloss: Would you make bills out and send them to Mr. Jackson's company --
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- as the bills would accrue when you do the work?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah, I would finish the work and render an invoice and mail it to Mr. Jackson's office.
Mr. Auchincloss: So, did you have any discussions with Mr. Konitzer and Mr. Weizner about what you were to do in Florida?
Hamid Moslehi: I asked them what the purpose is. I guess they didn't know or they didn't want to let me know, but I was never informed specifically why I went there. But at one point I was informed that it's not going to happen.
Mr. Auchincloss: When did that happen?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe was either the same day that I got there or it could be the same -- the day after.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who told you that it wasn't going to happen?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe Dieter.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you see any other individuals there that you recognized from the previous shoot at Debbie Rowe's -- at Marc Schaffel's house involving Debbie Rowe there in Florida when you were there?
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, there were -- I only met with Ronald and Dieter and Mr. Jackson's bodyguard.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who was that?
Hamid Moslehi: At the time I believe it was Mike and another gentleman.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was the -- what was their involvement, the two bodyguards? What did they have to do with this meeting?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: Maybe I'll start over again.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was the meeting with the bodyguards separate from the meeting with Mr. Konitzer and Mr. Weizner?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, it wasn't a meeting with them, but I met them there. I mean, I saw them there.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: You know.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you talk to them?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah. Casually.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever see the individual who was the interviewer in the Debbie Rowe shoot in Florida while you were there?
Hamid Moslehi: Not that I remember.
Mr. Auchincloss: Sorry?
Hamid Moslehi: Not that I remember --
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: -- seeing him there.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you see Mr. Jackson while you were in Florida?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't believe I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you receive any other instructions while you were in Florida from Mr. Weizner or Mr. Konitzer?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I informed them about having some footage of Martin Bashir, behind-the-scene documentary. And after discussing certain matters, they advised me to call Marc Schaffel.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you call Marc Schaffel?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: While you were in Florida?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you receive any instructions from Mr. Schaffel?
Hamid Moslehi: He wanted me to come back to L.A. so I can show him the footage.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you do so?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: When did that occur?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe the day after.
Mr. Auchincloss: So you fly back to Los Angeles. You didn't do any photography at all in Miami?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: And then the next day you meet with Mr. Schaffel?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did Mr. Schaffel -- what was that conversation about with Mr. Schaffel?
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, I explained to him that I have -- “I have certain footage of behind the scene that I shot during Martin Bashir production, and that I have made some agreement and arrangement with Dieter and Ronald in regard to usage of this footage, and they asked me to see you”. And then I showed him the footage, and that was it.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you receive any further instructions from Mr. Schaffel during the month of February concerning any other shoots, video shoots?
Hamid Moslehi: Some additional footage of Mr. Jackson's family interviews, some of Mr. Jackson's archival footage and so on.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm talking specifically about new video footage that you shot in the month of February --
Hamid Moslehi: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- at the request of Mr. Schaffel. Did you shoot any such video?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, there was some -- I mean, there were a few projects within the same one project --
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: -- which contained footage and creating a new footage of certain people.
Mr. Auchincloss: Let's begin with what the nature of this new one project was. What was the purpose of this new one project?
Hamid Moslehi: Was like -- was a rebuttal documentary of the Martin Bashir documentary.
Mr. Auchincloss: And who did you take new video footage of for purposes of that documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe we shot Mr. Jackson's parents, including his brother.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where did that take place?
Hamid Moslehi: At the Encino place in California. Mr. Jackson's house. Joe Jackson's house in Encino.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And do you know what date that video was shot?
Hamid Moslehi: Approximately February 15.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Any other video footage that you shot for this rebuttal film or this rebuttal documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: We're talking new footage, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes. New footage.
Hamid Moslehi: Well, we shot some footage of the Arvizo family, but it never got used. Never got aired on the FOX.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So let's talk about that. You were -- were you assigned to shoot video footage of the Arvizo family for purposes of this rebuttal video?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who assigned you to that task?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe was Marc Schaffel.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Do you know?
Hamid Moslehi: I think it was Marc Schaffel.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And were you instructed the nature of this video, what this video footage would be about involving the Arvizo family?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, this footage were supposed to be used in that rebuttal documentary that Martin Bashir basically originally did. So --
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Was this rebuttal film -- did this rebuttal film have a public relations purpose?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was the public relations purpose?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, to make Mr. Jackson look good.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And so what was the purpose -- or let me strike that. Were you ever informed as to what the purpose of taking video footage of the Arvizo family was? What was the purpose for taking footage of the Arvizo family?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, in the Martin Bashir documentary there was a shot of Gavin, I believe, and Mr. Jackson holding hands, which it created some sort of controversy about it. And we were trying to show that basically there was nothing between Mr. Jackson and Gavin that they were saying on the media and news and stuff like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm not sure I understand. There was nothing that -- that they were saying?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, just to rebuke (sic) that shot that -- basically Mr. Jackson holding the hand of Gavin. We were putting this family in front of a camera just to see what they have to say and use it in that rebuttal documentary.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you discuss this video-shooting with Mr. Schaffel?
Hamid Moslehi: Of the Arvizo family?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was it anticipated at all that this video would be a positive thing for Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: How so? How was it anticipated that this was going to be good for -- make Mr. Jackson look good?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, the footage that I shot of Martin Bashir during Martin Bashir production, there were a lot of segments or scenes that Mr. Bashir was saying --
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm going to interrupt you as not --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection to interrupting the witness.
Mr. Auchincloss: It's nonresponsive.
Mr. Mesereau: It is responsive, I believe, Your Honor.
The Court: It is. I'll allow you to finish the question -- or the answer. Do you want me to have the part read that you answered?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sorry, say that again?
The Court: I'm going to allow you to finish your answer. Do you want to hear the first part of your answer?
Hamid Moslehi: I forgot what I was talking about.
The Court: Read him the part of his answer.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm sorry, Your Honor, my question dealt with the previous question of the video of the Arvizos. It was not a general question about the video, the whole video.
The Court: I'll let her read the question.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
The Court Reporter: How so? How was it anticipated that this was going to be good for -- make Mr. Jackson look good?
The Court: Now you can finish your answer.
Hamid Moslehi: (Continuing) -- that Mr. Bashir was saying good thing about Michael Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. I'm going to go back to my -- what I intended to ask or make. How was the Arvizo family footage anticipated -- how was it anticipated that this would help Mr. Jackson to look good, in your discussions with Mr. Schaffel?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I mean, at that time, I don't think, there was no footage of the Arvizo, but we were supposed to shoot this footage.
Mr. Auchincloss: Right. I'm talking about the planning of it. You planned to shoot the Arvizo family, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: The plan was to do a video, a rebuttal video, that would make Mr. Jackson look good?
Hamid Moslehi: Overall, the plan of the rebuttal documentary was to make -- basically make Mr. Jackson look good.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was shooting the Arvizo family something you did to try and make Mr. Jackson look good in this rebuttal film?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, at the time, I didn't know how the final piece would look, because we were still in the production phase of this whole production. Once it's edited and you look at it, then you can, you know, basically decide whether that's going to make him look good or not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Let's just move on. The -- where was this -- originally where was this video shoot to take place?
Hamid Moslehi: At Neverland.
Mr. Auchincloss: And whose idea was that?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe was Marc Schaffel.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you ever go to Neverland to do this shoot?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: When was that?
Hamid Moslehi: February 19, 2003.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you bring any assistants with you, any assistants with you?
Hamid Moslehi: I took two people, crew, with me.
Mr. Auchincloss: What time did you arrive at Neverland?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say late afternoon, early evening. 7:00-ish, kind of. 6:00-ish.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you contact any members of the Arvizo family at Neverland that day?
Hamid Moslehi: I saw the three kids at Neverland, and I told them that, “We're supposed to shoot an interview with you guys”.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. The three kids, Gavin, Star and Davellin?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Janet at Neverland that day?
Hamid Moslehi: She was not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there any plan to shoot this video with Janet in it?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, it was.
Mr. Auchincloss: So did you make an effort to determine where Janet was?
Hamid Moslehi: I asked the kids where their mom is.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. What happened next?
Hamid Moslehi: They said, “She's not here”.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you do after that?
Hamid Moslehi: I asked them if they know where she is, because we're supposed to set up this lighting and camera equipment and do the interview. They -- I believe they told me that, “She's not here”, and they're going to -- I asked them if they can call her to see if she's going to do it or not, or what's the schedule.
Mr. Auchincloss: During that period, did you have any contact with Mr. Schaffel concerning this problem of the mother not being there?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Misstates the evidence; move to strike.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: Did I have any conversation with Schaffel? I believe so.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Tell me about it. Did you contact Mr. Schaffel?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe either he called me or I called him. I'm not sure. But there was a conversation saying that, “Janet, the mother, is not here”.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what was Mr. Schaffel's -- did Mr. Schaffel have a solution to this issue?
Hamid Moslehi: I guess not at --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered in furtherance.
The Court: First of all, that requires a “yes” or “no” answer.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Fair enough.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. Schaffel have a solution of this issue of Janet not being there where you intended to shoot the video involving the entire family?
Hamid Moslehi: Not at the time, I guess. It was just information going back and forth.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. At some point while you were at Neverland, did you talk to Janet Arvizo on the phone?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Had you previously met Janet Arvizo?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I believe I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. When had you previously met her?
Hamid Moslehi: Where?
Mr. Auchincloss: Where, let's say where?
Hamid Moslehi: At Neverland Valley.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Was that during one of the shoots that you had done with the Arvizo family before, the Arvizo kids?
Hamid Moslehi: The year 2001?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: I don't think so.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: It was maybe a birthday party of Mr. Jackson's kids or things like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you make any efforts to get Janet to come to Neverland to do the shoot?
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, I had a conversation on the phone with her.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: And I asked her whether she was going to do it or not so that I know what my schedule would be for that day.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did she want to do this video shoot?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; calls for speculation.
Mr. Auchincloss: It's offered --
The Court: Foundation; sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did she describe to you whether or not she was willing to do the rebuttal video shoot?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe at the beginning she was not happy to do this rebuttal video.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did she tell you why she didn't -- was not happy about it?
Hamid Moslehi: Um --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered for state of mind.
The Court: Well, the question is, did she tell you why she was not happy? But without telling us any more, did she? Did she tell you that, whether or not she was happy?
Hamid Moslehi: She told me that she's not happy.
The Court: Okay. So the Court will allow that for the limited purposes of her state of mind at that time.
Mr. Auchincloss: So my follow-up question, did she tell you -- and this is “yes” or “no”. Did she tell you what she was unhappy about, why she was unhappy about doing the rebuttal filming or video?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe yes, she did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did she tell you?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered for state of mind.
The Court: I'll admit this, her statement, for the limited purpose of her state of mind, not the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. You may answer.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Go ahead and answer that question.
Hamid Moslehi: Did she tell me why she didn't want to do it?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: She said since -- if I remember correctly, she said since the rebuttal documentary of Martin Bashir has aired, her life turned upside down because of the, you know, media and press following her, and that kind of stuff. And if I remember correctly, she said, “The last thing I want to do is do another video, you know, and expose myself to more hassle”.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did she want her children to be in another video?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm not sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was that any part of her concern?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you make any efforts to persuade her to make this video?
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, I told her that we're doing this rebuttal documentary and --
Mr. Auchincloss: That's really a “yes” or “no” question.
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sorry, say that again, the question.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yeah. Did you make any efforts to persuade her to do the rebuttal video, the rebuttal video involving --
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- this segment?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what was your purpose in doing that?
Hamid Moslehi: So I can get the production done.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. How long did you talk to her on the phone?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say 20 minutes, approximately 20.
Mr. Auchincloss: And was that 20 minutes largely -- did that deal with anything other than persuading her to agree to do the video? Did you talk about anything else?
Hamid Moslehi: She talked -- me or her or both parties?
Mr. Auchincloss: No, you said you were having a conversation. She's reluctant; true? You're persuading her. Was there anything -- any discussion, other than her coming to do the video, during that 20-minute phone conversation?
Hamid Moslehi: Not that I remember.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. When you finished the phone conversation, had Janet Arvizo agreed to do anything?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe she agreed to do this video finally.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you have a specific recollection whether she agreed to it or not?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe she did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did she say? Did she say -- you tell me.
Hamid Moslehi: I believe she said that she's going to do it. I mean, after we hung up, my understanding was that this is going to happen at one point.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where was it going to happen?
Hamid Moslehi: I didn't know at the time.
Mr. Auchincloss: So she said she'd do it, but she didn't say she would do it that day?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, there was not specific conversation about how, when, where it's going to happen. But I think, if I remember correctly, the conversation end up that it's going to happen. My understanding, if I remember correctly at the time, was that she's coming to Neverland to get it done.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So at the end of the conversation, you believe Janet's agreed and she's going to come to Neverland to do the film?
Hamid Moslehi: As I remember, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: About what time is it at this point?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say 9:00-ish, 10:00-ish, at night.
Mr. Auchincloss: At some point did you learn or decide -- let me strike that, start over. At some point did you decide that the filming was not going to take place that night at Neverland?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sorry, say that again. Me deciding, or --
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I was informed it's not going to happen at Neverland.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Who informed you of that?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe it was Marc Schaffel.
Mr. Auchincloss: You believe?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, Marc Schaffel, I think. It was Marc Schaffel.
Mr. Auchincloss: And how did you hear from Marc Schaffel that that was not going to take place at Neverland that night?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe it was a phone conversation.
Mr. Auchincloss: So you had -- was this the first phone conversation? Second? You tell me.
Hamid Moslehi: I believe could be second.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you receive some instructions from Mr. Schaffel regarding the filming on that second phone conversation?
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, he informed me that Janet, the mom, is going to -- is going to be in L.A. She's in L.A. Therefore, we're going to shoot this in L.A. He asked me if I can shoot that in my house. I respond to him that if we can shoot it at his house, but then he said he doesn't want them to remember where he lives. So we ended up shooting at my house.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Schaffel said he didn't want who to know where he lived?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe the family.
Mr. Auchincloss: So what did you do then?
Hamid Moslehi: I informed my crew that this production will not take -- this shoot will not take place at Neverland. I let them know that they should pack the equipment. And then I got the three kids and we drove back to my house.
Mr. Auchincloss: After you spoke to Mr. Schaffel and learned that the shoot was going to take place at your house, did you have a conversation with Joe Marcus, the Neverland Ranch manager?
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, I -- when I arrived at Neverland, I let him know why I'm there, to shoot this interview. Then later, I informed him that it's not going to happen here at Neverland, it's going to be at my house, and I'm taking the kids with me.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you tell him that you were going to do the shoot with the mother and the kids?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was Mr. Marcus's reaction when you told him that you wanted to take the kids off of Neverland?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered in furtherance.
The Court: All right. I'm going to admit it for the limited purposes previously discussed on the conspiracy issue.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did Mr. Marcus tell you when you informed him that -- of your intent to take the children --
Hamid Moslehi: I believe he said --
Mr. Auchincloss: -- to your home?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe he said, “They're not allowed to leave the property”.
Mr. Auchincloss: You believe that or did --
Hamid Moslehi: I did --
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you remember what he said?
Hamid Moslehi: I remember he said, “They're not allowed to leave the property”.
Mr. Auchincloss: At some point did you confront him with the intent or did you confront him with the necessity to have the children go down to your home to complete the video shoot?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, at one point I believe I informed him that the video that we were supposed to shoot at Neverland, it's not going to take place, and it's going to be at my house.
Mr. Auchincloss: Uh-huh.
Hamid Moslehi: So the kids are coming with me.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he agree to anything at that time during that first conversation with you in terms of letting the kids off the property?
Hamid Moslehi: He agreed?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes. Did he agree with you about anything during that first conversation you had with Joe Marcus where he told you that the kids are not allowed off of the property?
Hamid Moslehi: What do you mean, did he agree? Do you mean letting them go with me, or --
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember hearing anything from him.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. What did you do then?
Hamid Moslehi: Then I let the kids know that within, like, 15 minutes we're going to take off, “So get your stuff ready”.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you do in the next 15 minutes?
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, I went to help my crew so we can pack the car, the equipment back to the car, and take off.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you see Joe Marcus again before you left Neverland?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you talk to him about getting the kids off the property?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm not sure if I had a conversation with him about that, but he saw me leaving.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. So you were allowed to leave Neverland when you drove off the property, when you wanted to leave the property?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah, that's right.
Mr. Auchincloss: And how much time went by between the time that you first told Joe Marcus -- or when Joe Marcus first told you the kids are not allowed off Neverland and the time that you actually drove off of Neverland?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say approximately half an hour.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you went down to the theater to collect your equipment, where was -- where did Joe Marcus go, or where was he?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't know.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he come with you?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if he had any conversations with anybody during that meantime?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm not sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. So you took the kids, personally you loaded them up in one of the vehicles?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: How many vehicles?
Hamid Moslehi: I took two vehicles of mine to Neverland.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And which vehicle did the kids go in?
Hamid Moslehi: I had a Suburban for the equipment and the crew, and a BMW for myself, basically.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Which one did the kids go in?
Hamid Moslehi: The BMW.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you drove that?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you drive straight to your home?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: About what time was it when you ultimately arrived at your home?
Hamid Moslehi: Approximately 11:00-ish.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did the children do during the drive down from Santa Barbara?
Hamid Moslehi: We had some little conversations, and they went to sleep.
Mr. Auchincloss: Your home is in Calabasas?
Hamid Moslehi: West Hills.
Mr. Auchincloss: West Hills. So you arrived at your home about 11:00. What did you do then?
Hamid Moslehi: I immediately started loading equipment to the area that I was going to shoot, and let the kids play with video games and things like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you have some video games at your home?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: Some fancy ones?
Hamid Moslehi: Not really.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So they played video games?
Hamid Moslehi: That's right.
Mr. Auchincloss: All three of them?
Hamid Moslehi: I guess the guys. She was -- I don't know what she was doing. I don't remember exactly. But she was there, too.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did they stay in one area of the house during that period?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: And were your two assistants still with you?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, they were.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there anybody else at the house when you first arrived, other than you, your assistants and the Arvizo kids?
Hamid Moslehi: No. Just us.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did someone arrive at the house shortly thereafter?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who was that? Who was the first person to arrive?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe was Christian Robinson, and another gentleman by the name of Paul, which is an associate of Marc Schaffel.
Mr. Auchincloss: Had you met Paul before?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: On what occasion?
Hamid Moslehi: In the year 2001, Mr. Jackson did the project “What More Can I Give?” And Paul was involved somehow with that production helping Schaffel.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you set up your equipment for the shoot?
Hamid Moslehi: At my house, yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: During that period, did anybody else show up at the house after Christian and Paul arrived?
Hamid Moslehi: Another gentleman; I believe was Brad Miller.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he arrive by himself?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Had you ever seen Brad Miller before?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you ever seen him since that night?
Hamid Moslehi: No. On T.V., I guess, once.
Mr. Auchincloss: And he arrived by himself?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have any understanding of what Brad Miller was doing at your home that night?
Hamid Moslehi: No. And I remember asking Christian who this guy is, and they said, “Don't worry about it. It's just a private detective”.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you ever done any video shoots where there was a private detective invited to watch at a home that the shoot occurred at?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever see Brad Miller do anything that evening?
Hamid Moslehi: He was walking around my house.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did anybody else arrive at your home?
Hamid Moslehi: Vinnie and the mother.
Mr. Auchincloss: Janet Arvizo?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know about what time they arrived?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say towards midnight.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. So how was the preparation going at this point for the video shoot?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, me and my crew were setting up the lighting. Mainly I'm doing the lighting, background, sound and that kind of stuff. They're bringing the equipment in. Sorry. And Janet was getting her makeup done. And the kids were just, you know, playing with games and stuff like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did anybody do Janet's makeup for her?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't believe -- she did her own makeup.
Mr. Auchincloss: And how did you feel at this point about this scene, if you can characterize it in terms of the time, the people? Was there anything unusual about this?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, timing was a little -- you know, kind of getting late. Also having Brad Miller in my house, I didn't really feel comfortable.
Mr. Auchincloss: Had you met Vinnie before?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And prior to the shooting of the video, did you become aware of any problems that Janet had, any additional problems that Janet expressed concerning the shooting of the video?
Hamid Moslehi: I think there was a problem with the contract or the release that they were asking her to sign.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: And if I remember correctly, Vinnie asked me to use my fax machine and that kind of things.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you say “they” were having a problem with her?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; misstates the evidence.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, I believe you said, “...They were asking her to sign”. Who were “they”?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe it was Paul and Vinnie and potentially Christian Robinson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So if I could have the Elmo briefly, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm showing you again Exhibit No. 194 which you previously identified as your home. Can you identify that perspective for me?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah, this is a view of my living room.
Mr. Auchincloss: And does this area -- does this photograph depict any area of the part of your home that was used in the video shoot?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Which area? Explain it to me.
Hamid Moslehi: This is where I set up the background.
Mr. Auchincloss: Uh-huh.
Hamid Moslehi: I believe the family were sitting approximately in this area. And my camera was like -- it's off of this frame, but about this area.
Mr. Auchincloss: You've indicated the background was in the center of the carpeting, the carpet, or I should say rug?
Hamid Moslehi: Right about there.
Mr. Auchincloss: And then the seating area was at the front, between the two carpets?
Hamid Moslehi: About there.
Mr. Auchincloss: The two rugs. And then your camera was down outside the frame of the picture?
Hamid Moslehi: Outside this frame.
Mr. Auchincloss: Below it. Okay. And where were the boys and Davellin during the period of the downtime when you were preparing the video shoot?
Hamid Moslehi: That's my T.V. set-up, so that's where they were sitting. It's like a little coffee table and a little video game stuff.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where was the discussion that was taking place between Janet, Paul, Vinnie and possibly Christian?
Hamid Moslehi: In the other room, which is out of this frame.
Mr. Auchincloss: Showing you Exhibit 193, would you identify that area?
Hamid Moslehi: That's, well, like a billiard room, kind of.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is that the area you're saying that the conversation took place in?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Now, you said you have a fax machine?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where is your fax machine in your home?
Hamid Moslehi: Upstairs. I have three rooms upstairs, and one of them's an office.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know which of those individuals went upstairs? I believe you said Vinnie went and used the fax. Anybody else?
Hamid Moslehi: Not that I remember. I think it was Vinnie.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you. So how much time passed between the time that Janet arrived at your home and the time that you started shooting the video?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say a couple of hours, approximately.
Mr. Auchincloss: How much time went by in which Janet was -- how long did this discussion take place between Janet, Vinnie, Paul and possibly Christian?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say half an hour.
Mr. Auchincloss: How much time did it take for you to set up the video equipment?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say hour to hour and a half.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you hear any of the conversation between Janet and these other parties about the consent form?
Hamid Moslehi: Did I hear any conversation?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yeah. You told us the general context of the conversation. Did you hear any specifics about what the issue was about signing this consent?
Hamid Moslehi: No, I did not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Can you tell me what Janet's demeanor was? What was her -- what was her mood like? How did she act about this?
Hamid Moslehi: About the --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, that's fine. I can lay a better foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: You mentioned that Janet had a problem with signing the consent form.
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why do you say that? What do you base that on?
Hamid Moslehi: Because I observed that they're looking at the contract, and she was going through it, and there was some, I guess, words that she was not happy with or the content of this contract. And then at one point Vinnie asked me to use my fax machine, I guess to get faxed in or out, to redraft that contract, some sort.
Mr. Auchincloss: During that period of time that you were observing Janet and these individuals, did you have a chance to see what her demeanor was like? Do you know what I mean by “demeanor”?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah, like an attitude?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yeah. What was her attitude like?
Hamid Moslehi: Um --
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have a chance to notice that?
Hamid Moslehi: I was very busy setting up equipment, so I didn't really pay attention to each individual's, you know --
Mr. Auchincloss: Right.
Hamid Moslehi: -- attitude or whatever. She was, I guess, normal. I guess. I don't know.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did she seem happy about it?
Hamid Moslehi: Um --
Mr. Auchincloss: About this thing they wanted her to sign?
Hamid Moslehi: She wasn't happy about the assignment, or I mean the contract that she wanted to sign, as I understood.
Mr. Auchincloss: So ultimately you do the video shoot?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if she signed anything that night?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe she did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you see her sign something?
Hamid Moslehi: No, I did not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Why do you say you think she did?
Hamid Moslehi: Because it looks like Marc's people were happy.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: So --
Mr. Auchincloss: So you do the video shoot. Was it a continuous shoot or were there segments?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe we shot one-hour interview, and each of these professional tapes are 30 minutes. I don't believe there were so many cuts in it, so we continued rolling camera, basically. Maybe one or two cuts in between, if any.
Mr. Auchincloss: So how much video footage did you shoot total?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say approximately an hour.
Mr. Auchincloss: At the conclusion of the -- of this project, when you finished shooting it, what happened? After you finished it, you've got the videotape. What happened next?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, we wrapped equipment and everybody left.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you see who left with whom?
Hamid Moslehi: Not specifically, no.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you provide the videotape that you had shot to anybody, any member of the group that had come from -- well, did you give that tape to anybody that night? Let me just put it that way.
Hamid Moslehi: No, I didn't.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did anybody want that tape?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Calls for speculation; vague; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: I can ask the question a little better.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did somebody ask you for that tape?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe Paul, Marc Schaffel's associate.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there a discussion with Paul about him getting the tape that night?
Hamid Moslehi: He asked me to turn him -- turn over the tapes to him.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: And I refused.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did anybody else ask you to turn those tapes over, other than Paul?
Hamid Moslehi: Maybe Christian.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: I'm not sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why did you refuse to turn the tapes over?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, first of all, I wanted to make a copy so in case -- as insurance, to have a second copy of that tape. Also, there was some other issues that were not resolved by then, so I kind of kept the tape for that.
Mr. Auchincloss: At the conclusion of the evening, did you spend some time with Janet, any time privately with Janet?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: When did that occur in relationship to the end of the video shoot and everybody leaving?
Hamid Moslehi: It was towards the end of when everybody was leaving. At the end of the shoot.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you remember who was still at the home at that time?
Hamid Moslehi: Everybody was there.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have a purpose in meeting her separately?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was your purpose?
Hamid Moslehi: I -- I remember I gave her, like, a loan.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. What was -- let me back up. During the period of time that you first became acquainted with the Arvizos to the time of this shoot, how many separate meetings would you say you had with the Arvizo family?
Hamid Moslehi: Including the kids?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yeah.
Hamid Moslehi: Six, seven.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you get to know them?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: How did you feel about the Arvizo family?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; foundation; relevance.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you at some point that night decide to give Janet Arvizo a loan based on your own desire?
Hamid Moslehi: Did I decide?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yeah.
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: You did.
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Janet Arvizo ever ask you for any money?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did she ever request anything from you?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
The Court: All right. We'll take our break now.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. I think where we left off, we were talking about --
The Bailiff: Is your microphone on?
Mr. Auchincloss: It is now, yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: We were talking about the end of the video shoot and your having this private conversation with Janet. When you had that private conversation with Janet, did you give her some money?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And I think I've already asked you, did she ever ask you for that money?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Whose idea was it to give Janet some money?
Hamid Moslehi: It was mine.
Mr. Auchincloss: During that period of time that you were with the Arvizo family, did you form any kind of affection for this family during this period of time?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
Mr. Auchincloss: Goes to his --
Mr. Mesereau: And leading.
The Court: All right. The objection is overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: I kind of felt sorry when I -- about the whole family, about Gavin being -- you know, being sick, and, you know, close to dying from cancer, and that kind of thing. So -- and then over the video shoot that we had in, I believe, October 2000, I worked with Star and Gavin very closely, so we became kind of, you know, buddies --
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: -- in a way.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Were those the reasons why you did this act?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll strike that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did what you have just described have anything to do with your decision to give Janet some money?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sorry. Repeat that question one more time.
Mr. Auchincloss: You just described that you had some affection for Gavin and Star and you were sad about the hardship of Gavin's cancer. Did your feelings towards the Arvizo family have anything to do with your decision to give them -- give Janet some money?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And how much money did you give Janet?
Hamid Moslehi: $2,000.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you envision that she would pay this back some day?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Hamid Moslehi: Can I answer that?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes, you can answer it.
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I told her that, “This is a loan, a personal loan, from me to you, and pay me whenever you have the money”.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you have a date that you envisioned getting this money back by?
Hamid Moslehi: No. I left it up to her.
Mr. Auchincloss: During the period of time that you were working on this rebuttal film, and I mean the entire film, not just the portion with the Arvizos, did you work with -- did you spend any time at Mr. Schaffel's home?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you do at Mr. Schaffel's home?
Hamid Moslehi: Mostly rough editing, meaning I would go through Mr. Jackson's archival footage, find certain footage from concerts to some other material. And while we were creating this new footages for the interviews, then I would make a rough cut. And then the production company who was assigned to do this entire video, Brad Lachman Productions, would do the final editing.
Mr. Auchincloss: During this period of time, did you ever have an opportunity to overhear Mr. Schaffel talking on the phone?
Hamid Moslehi: As I remember, there were a couple of times that I had, like, questions that I wanted to ask Marc Schaffel, and I would walk from the room where we set up the equipment, like the editing equipment, to his office, and, you know, he would be on the phone or things like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever hear him making any remarks concerning getting people out of the country?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; foundation; move to strike.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, one occasion I walked into the room, and I think I heard Schaffel saying, “We're going to get them out of the country”.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you remember hearing that?
Hamid Moslehi: To my best recollection, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there anything about the context of that conversation that struck you as unusual?
Hamid Moslehi: Not at the time.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you know what he was talking about?
Hamid Moslehi: Not at the time.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you know who he was talking to?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: So at some point you said that during 2003, you were -- you ended your relationship as Mr. Jackson's personal DP; is that correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, Mr. Jackson stopped calling and using my service.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Was there a specific date that was associated with that change?
Hamid Moslehi: I think after that rebuttal documentary, “The Footage You Were Never Meant To See” --
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: -- I guess after that, basically that was the last project that Mr. Jackson used my services.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you ever terminated?
Hamid Moslehi: Terminated -- well, they just stopped using my service.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you ever informed that your services were no longer required?
Hamid Moslehi: I received a letter from --
Mr. Auchincloss: That's “yes” or “no”.
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So tell me, do you remember what date that was?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe it was February 21st of 2003.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when did “The Footage You Were Never Meant To See”, that rebuttal video, when did that air on the network?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe it was February 20th of 2003.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you watch it on T.V.?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. Jackson ever contact you after that?
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, the day after, he called me. Mr. Jackson called me.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what was the substance of -- what was the purpose of that phone call?
Hamid Moslehi: He thanked me for my good work.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have any conversations with him -- well, let me strike that. Does Mr. Jackson still owe you the $250,000 that had been promised?
Hamid Moslehi: Part of this is paid, but there's still a substantial amount of unpaid invoices that has not been paid yet.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you bring that up with Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: I -- I believe I had one conversation to him about my invoices not being paid. But I had hundreds of conversation with his personal assistant, his accountant, all his agents, including his managers, and his lawyers.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. My question is, did you bring that up to Mr. Jackson on the 20th when he called you -- or was it the 21st --
Hamid Moslehi: The 21st.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- the 21st when he called you and said you did a good job on the rebuttal video?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe I mentioned that for the very first time that my invoices are not being paid.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Later that day, did you receive a communication from Mr. Jackson's attorney?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. Yes, go ahead.
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was his name?
Hamid Moslehi: David LeGrand.
Mr. Auchincloss: And can you tell me what the substance of that communication was?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Can you tell me.... It's offered in furtherance, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is that the day that you were terminated?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Misstates the evidence; move to strike.
Mr. Auchincloss: That's fair.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is that the day that you were informed --
The Court: Stricken. Go ahead. Next question.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is that the day that you were informed that your services were no longer required by Mr. Jackson?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; misstates the evidence.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you ever informed that your services were no longer required by Mr. Jackson?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: When were you informed that your services -- when were you informed that Mr. Jackson no longer needed your services?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Misstates the evidence; leading; move to strike.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: I believe was February 21st, by a letter.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. How did you receive that letter?
Hamid Moslehi: By fax.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was it before or after you spoke with Mr. Jackson on the phone?
Hamid Moslehi: After.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you continue to make any efforts to have your outstanding bill paid by Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you do?
Hamid Moslehi: I made several communications between Mr. Jackson's accountant, managers, personal assistant, and his lawyer, David LeGrand. I have provided them with my invoices, and I basically let them know that, you know, my invoices are not being paid and they are due immediately. And it was failed.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever make an attempt to contact Mr. Jackson again personally about your outstanding invoices?
Hamid Moslehi: I remember I made a conversation with Mr. Jackson's personal assistant, Evvy, and I explained to her that my invoices were promised to be paid at certain date, and they are not, and that I'd like to make a meeting with Mr. Jackson to discuss these matters.
Mr. Auchincloss: So did you attempt to meet with Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: When was that?
Hamid Moslehi: The meeting was supposed to be, I believe, February 26th of 2003.
Mr. Auchincloss: And how did you go about attempting to contact Mr. Jackson on that date?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe I spoke to Evvy, Mr. Jackson's personal assistant, and I was informed that Mr. Jackson will come to L.A. from Florida at certain date, and that I can meet with Mr. Jackson, have a meeting with him and go through these issues.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you go to Neverland that day?
Hamid Moslehi: I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: And was Mr. Jackson there?
Hamid Moslehi: When I arrived at Neverland, Mr. Jackson was not there.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you do?
Hamid Moslehi: I talk -- I spoke to, I believe, Joe Marcus, and I told him the reason I'm in Neverland, to meet with Mr. Jackson. And he informed me that Mr. Jackson is on his way, coming home right now, so why not just wait for him.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you wait for him?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. Jackson show up?
Hamid Moslehi: I saw Mr. Jackson arriving, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he arrive with anybody?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe with his entourage, like Miko and bodyguards, and I think maybe his own kids.
Mr. Auchincloss: You previously mentioned Miko, identified his picture. Is he a part of Mr. Jackson's entourage?
Hamid Moslehi: Sometimes he travels with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know what his relationship is with Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say friend/associate, some sort. Personal assistant kind of.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. So where were you when Mr. Jackson arrived at Neverland?
Hamid Moslehi: I was waiting for Mr. Jackson outside the main house in the little catering area, and just waiting for him so he can -- you know, so I can have this meeting with him.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you see him?
Hamid Moslehi: I saw Mr. Jackson coming in.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he see you?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe he did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Could he have missed you?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; calls for speculation.
Mr. Auchincloss: That's fair.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where were you standing in relationship to Mr. Jackson when he walked in his house?
Hamid Moslehi: Again, I was behind the main house on the north side of the main house. There's a little catering area, kind of, a little bar kind of. It's not like a liquor bar, but like a little catering bar area.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: I was just waiting. There were two tables there. I was just sitting and waiting.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was that in clear view where Mr. Jackson walked?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe, yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: You could see him clearly?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: How far away were you from him?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say 30 feet, 40 feet.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he acknowledge you?
Hamid Moslehi: Um, that I'm there?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yeah. Did he even -- did he acknowledge that you were there in any way?
Hamid Moslehi: Mmm --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; calls for speculation.
The Court: Overruled.
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember whether he saw me, I mean eye contact or not, but I felt like that he knows that I'm here.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did he wave, say anything to you, do anything to acknowledge your presence?
Hamid Moslehi: Not at that moment.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he do it at some other time?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I -- I received a call.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So Mr. Jackson walks inside -- did he go inside his house?
Hamid Moslehi: He was going inside his house.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And you were still sitting where you were sitting?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: What happened after that?
Hamid Moslehi: They informed me that there's a phone call for me.
Mr. Auchincloss: How much time passed between the time that Mr. Jackson walked into his house and you were informed that there was a phone call for you?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say five to ten minutes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you go inside and take this phone call?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who was it from?
Hamid Moslehi: Evvy called me, Mr. Jackson's assistant.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what was the purpose of this call?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you do something after you talked to Evvy?
Hamid Moslehi: I left the property.
Mr. Auchincloss: Has Mr. Jackson ever paid you the money he owes you?
Hamid Moslehi: Not in full.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you had to take legal action to try and get your money?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; assumes facts not in evidence.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I have filed a lawsuit.
Mr. Auchincloss: After you terminated or after you stopped working the last time for Mr. Jackson, did you become aware that you were -- at any time that you were being -- that there was surveillance on you?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: Did I know about surveillance being conducted on me? No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you give anybody permission to take your video, take videotapes of you?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: And prior to your testimony today, did you review a DVD on this computer to my left of an Exhibit No. 815? Did you review that?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is that image an image of you?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, it is.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is that an image that you permitted or allowed anybody to take?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: No, I did not give permission to anybody to follow me or take pictures of me.
Mr. Auchincloss: Your Honor, there's one last unpublished portion of 815 that I'd like to publish for the jury at this time. We've previously admitted the rest of that DVD.
The Court: All right. Is that on the computer, or is it on --
Mr. Auchincloss: That's on the computer, so I'd ask for “Input 1”. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 815, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Moslehi, whose vehicle is that? We're looking at a -- appears to be a large SUV in the center frame of this picture.
Hamid Moslehi: It seems to be my vehicle.
Mr. Auchincloss: And who is the individual that I've stopped -- where I've stopped this video at? Who is the individual that seems to be approaching that vehicle?
Hamid Moslehi: It seems to be me.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 815, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Auchincloss: That's it. Thank you, Mr. Moslehi. No more questions.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Good afternoon.
Hamid Moslehi: Good afternoon.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Moslehi, my name is Thomas Mesereau, and I speak for Mr. Jackson.
Hamid Moslehi: Nice meeting you.
Mr. Mesereau: Same here. You gave an interview on April 23rd of this year with Sergeant Steve Robel, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Where was this?
Mr. Mesereau: I'm not sure where. My understanding is that you were with your attorney, Mr. Dowling, correct? And you met with Sergeant Steve Robel of the Santa Barbara sheriffs. Do you recall that recent interview?
Hamid Moslehi: You said the 24th of 2004?
Mr. Mesereau: The date that I have is April 23rd. Do you recall a recent interview with a Santa Barbara sheriff?
Hamid Moslehi: Of this year, 2005?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And your lawyer was present, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember my lawyer being present.
Mr. Mesereau: Is your lawyer's name Mr. Dowling?
Hamid Moslehi: Alan Dowling.
Mr. Mesereau: Alan Dowling, okay. And when -- let me restate all this. You recently interviewed with a Santa Barbara sheriff, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And when do you think that interview was?
Hamid Moslehi: Recent-recent or --
Mr. Mesereau: The most recent interview you gave to a Santa Barbara sheriff.
Hamid Moslehi: The most recent was, I guess, two days ago.
Mr. Mesereau: Right. Okay. And to your knowledge, was that with a Sergeant Steve Robel of the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office; do you know?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe I was talking to another gentleman. Maybe he was present in and out or -- kind of things.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Where did the interview take place?
Hamid Moslehi: This interview took place at Santa Barbara District Attorney's Office.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know if any representative of the Santa Barbara District Attorney's Office was present at the interview you gave?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah. I think, again, at the beginning, I was talking to Mr. Auchincloss. Then Mr. Robel came in and out.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: And, yeah, Mr. Alan Dowling was there, too.
Mr. Mesereau: Right. Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah. I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: And the purpose of the interview was to inform the prosecution for the first time that you had given money to Janet Arvizo, right?
Hamid Moslehi: The purpose of the interview was I guess an overall of what's going to be taking place in this courtroom --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: -- when I take the stand.
Mr. Mesereau: And in the interview, you admitted that you now recalled that you had given $2,000 to Janet Arvizo, right?
Hamid Moslehi: During that interview, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. And you indicated to the Santa Barbara sheriffs that Janet had not ever directly asked you for money, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: But you also indicated with your attorney that Ms. Arvizo had described to you her financial situation from time to time, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, I had one conversation with Janet Arvizo which took place at Neverland, and this was right after the Martin Bashir documentary.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: And at that time, there were some discussions as to her life is upside down, and, you know, she can't work and things like this.
Mr. Mesereau: But at some point she led you to believe that her family was having some financial difficulties, true?
Hamid Moslehi: What I understood from that conversation is that she couldn't work and that they had to, you know, move around because of the media and the press following them.
Mr. Mesereau: Right. She led you to believe at one point that she was out of money, right?
Hamid Moslehi: We never discussed money with her. I mean, she was just explaining to me what has happened to her since the Martin Bashir documentary.
Mr. Mesereau: But you got the impression at one point that she needed financial assistance, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Um, that she needed financial assistance?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, let me restate the question.
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: In that interview you had with the Santa Barbara sheriffs on April 23rd, 2005, your lawyer spoke to Sergeant Robel, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct. Alan Dowling.
Mr. Mesereau: And he did so in your presence, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And on your behalf, your lawyer indicated that you had learned about Janet Arvizo's dire financial circumstances, correct?
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm going to object -- I'm going to object as to any comments about this lawyer as hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Was one of the --
Mr. Auchincloss: And I'll move to strike the question.
The Court: It's not necessary. Go ahead.
Mr. Mesereau: Was one of the purposes of that meeting for you and your lawyer to explain why you gave $2,000 to Janet Arvizo?
Hamid Moslehi: One of -- yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And on your behalf, your lawyer did at one point explain why, true?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point, it was your belief that Janet Arvizo was out of money, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Again, if I remember correctly, we didn't specifically talk about money. She was mainly complaining about her life being upside down because of this Martin Bashir documentary, and not being able to work.
Mr. Mesereau: And the impression you got was that she needed some financial assistance, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: Could you repeat that again, please?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. You got the impression that Janet and her family could use some financial help. That's why you made a loan, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You based your conclusion that Janet needed financial help on what she had said to you from time to time, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Could you repeat that one more time?
Mr. Mesereau: Sure. Let me restate it completely. You didn't just give her $2,000 for no reason, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You thought she could use it, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You thought she needed it based on things she had told you about she and her family, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: She didn't directly ask for it at any time, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No, she never asked for it.
Mr. Mesereau: But she led you to believe that their lives had been turned upside down and she needed some financial help, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Compound; misstates the evidence; asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: Could you repeat that one more time? I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, okay. At some point -- let me restate the question. I'll withdraw the previous question.
Hamid Moslehi: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: At some point after numerous discussions with Ms. Arvizo, you formed the conclusion that she and her family could use some financial help from you, right?
Hamid Moslehi: After one conversation with her that night, February 19th, on the phone, I felt that they could use some financial assistance.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And because you had reached that conclusion, you gave her $2,000, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You called it a loan, but you didn't expect to be repaid, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, actually, I've been expecting to be paid. But if not, I can live without it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I mean, realistically when you gave it to her, did you expect her to repay it?
Hamid Moslehi: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you --
Hamid Moslehi: I mentioned, “This is not a gift. It's a loan. It's from me”.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: “And pay me whenever”.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And has she ever repaid it?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, is the conversation where you spoke to her and then concluded she could use some financial help the 25-minute conversation?
Hamid Moslehi: Approximately.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And to your knowledge, where was Janet Arvizo when you had this approximately 25-minute conversation?
Hamid Moslehi: At what location she was, you mean?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. If you know.
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: And did she call you?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you call her?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Where were you when you had the 25-minute conversation?
Hamid Moslehi: At Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And do you know approximately what date that conversation took place?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe it was February 19, 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So the impression you got that Janet could use a little help was formed before the rebuttal video was filmed at your home, true?
Hamid Moslehi: That's true.
Mr. Mesereau: The rebuttal video was filmed at your home the next day, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, the morning after.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Once, you know, it goes over midnight, the date changes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, are you familiar with a company called I Films, Inc.?
Hamid Moslehi: That's my company.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that still your company?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, it is.
Mr. Mesereau: And the services you provided to either Mr. Jackson or Mr. Jackson's company has been on behalf of I Films, Inc., right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that's a corporation, obviously, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And I believe you said you've been providing services for Mr. Jackson for a long time, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: From 1996 to 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. And when you've provided services for Mr. Jackson, you have periodically gone to different locations to provide the service, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you have typically sent an invoice not long after you provide the service, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. At some point you dealt with a company called Brad Lachman Productions, Inc., right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And to your knowledge, who is Brad Lachman Productions, Inc.?
Hamid Moslehi: It's a production company that FOX hired to put the rebuttal documentary together.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Final editing.
Mr. Mesereau: And was it your understanding that that rebuttal documentary was being done by FOX Television?
Hamid Moslehi: What do you mean, “by FOX Television”?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you mentioned FOX, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah, it was supposed to be aired by FOX.
Mr. Mesereau: And to your knowledge, was FOX involved in the production in any way?
Hamid Moslehi: Could have been.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When you were doing the filming, was it your belief that FOX was somehow involved at that point?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I never met anybody from FOX Television to discuss certain matters, but most of the communications came from Brad Lachman Productions.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you signed an agreement with Brad Lachman Productions on approximately February 14th, 2003, right?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you that document?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
Hamid Moslehi: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that document?
Hamid Moslehi: I never been provided with that document.
Mr. Mesereau: But do you see your signature on the document?
Hamid Moslehi: It seems to be my signature.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall what the purpose of that document was?
Hamid Moslehi: There was an interview of me being used in that rebuttal documentary.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And when you were interviewed, who did your interview, if you know?
Hamid Moslehi: Brad Lachman Productions.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did they choose an interviewer to actually interview you?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe they did.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you recall where your interview took place?
Hamid Moslehi: In a hotel.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And was that prearranged by somebody?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And I gather the purpose of that interview was to allow you, who had known Michael Jackson, to say good things about him?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, actually that interview was supposed to be the rebuttal, to be used for the rebuttal documentary that we were working on titled, “Footage You Were Never Meant To See”.
Mr. Mesereau: Right.
Hamid Moslehi: To respond to some of the comments that Martin Bashir made.
Mr. Mesereau: And the reason you were interviewed was that when Martin Bashir was filming his interview with Michael Jackson, you were also filming that interview, true?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And Bashir had arranged to film the interview separate and apart from what you were doing, right?
Hamid Moslehi: There were two different cameras and two different angles.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. And you were filming it at the request of Mr. Jackson, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Who were you filming it at the request of?
Hamid Moslehi: Myself. There was no request as far as me recording it. I decided on my own.
Mr. Mesereau: But certainly Mr. Jackson knew you were there, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were right next to Mr. Jackson doing your filming while Bashir was doing his filming of Mr. Jackson, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And your intention was to make sure you had a full copy of all the questions and answers between Bashir and Michael Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: Repeat that question one more time.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Maybe I wasn't clear on that. Your intent was to try and film a complete copy of the interview between Bashir and Michael Jackson, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Actually, my intention was just to document this interview on my camera.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, okay. And one of the purposes was not to allow Bashir to have exclusive possession of what he had done in that interview, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Would you repeat that one more time?
Mr. Mesereau: Sure. I'm sorry if I'm unclear. If you hadn't filmed Mr. Bashir's interview with Michael Jackson, logic suggests that the only person that would have had a copy of that interview would have been Bashir, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, you see, there were like two different cameras, one single scene. So meaning if there was not my camera in there --
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: -- the only other camera that would have been in there would have been Martin Bashir's camera.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. And if that had been the case, Mr. Bashir could have selectively used, or not used, whatever parts he wanted and he would have had control of all the product, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you saw the Bashir documentary, you knew that there were parts where Mr. Bashir had said positive things about Michael Jackson that he had left out of his documentary, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And the reason you were being interviewed by Brad Lachman Productions was because the intention was to have some of those parts that you had filmed appear in the rebuttal video, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's --
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm going to object; relevancy and beyond the scope.
Mr. Mesereau: I believe he opened the entire door, Your Honor.
The Court: The objection's overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, the title of that documentary on television was, “The Michael Jackson Interview: The Footage You Were Never Meant To See”, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That was the title of the rebuttal video, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And the words “The Footage You Were Never Meant To See” were supposed to apply to footage you had?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: That Bashir had never used, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: That included footage where Mr. Bashir was complimenting Mr. Jackson on what a parent he was, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's right.
Mr. Mesereau: Complimenting Mr. Jackson on what a good person he was, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: He was complimenting Mr. Jackson on his wonderful role in the world involving children, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: Right?
Hamid Moslehi: Do I answer?
The Court: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: He had footage about Mr. Jackson wanting an international day in honor of children, right?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sorry. Say that again.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Bashir, in his interview, talked to Mr. Jackson about Mr. Jackson's desire to have a day around the world in celebration of children, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And your belief at that time was that Mr. Bashir had presented a very distorted view of that interview with Mr. Jackson, correct?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; calls for a conclusion.
Mr. Mesereau: State of mind, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: Relevance.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: Say that one more time.
Mr. Mesereau: Yeah, I'm sorry. Sorry. Your role in the television show titled, “The Michael Jackson Interview: The Footage You Were Never Meant To See”, was to talk about the footage you had in that interview that Bashir didn't use, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was footage that was very positive about Mr. Jackson, true?
Hamid Moslehi: Most of Martin Bashir's comments were positive.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. And the agreement you signed with Brad Lachman Productions related to the fact that you yourself were going to appear in that documentary, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: So your role in that documentary was not just filming people. It was actually appearing yourself, right?
Hamid Moslehi: At one point, yes. I basically did an interview to appear in that with the permission of Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. That's why you signed an agreement with Brad Lachman Productions, Inc., right?
Hamid Moslehi: Just for that interview.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: For my interview, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Not the footage.
Mr. Mesereau: But the consent was to use your likeness and your words in the show, right?
Hamid Moslehi: My image, my voice in the show.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Okay. And you signed that on February 14th, 2003, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Again, I don't -- I don't think I have the copy of that, but if that's what it says, I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that is what it says, and you think that's accurate?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sure. If you tell me, I believe you.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You believe that's accurate, the date I showed you, right?
Hamid Moslehi: I didn't pay attention to the date. I was just looking at my signature.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection just to see the date?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach?
The Court: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at the document?
Hamid Moslehi: No. (Laughter.)
Hamid Moslehi: Oh, right now? Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about the entire thing.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Have you had a chance to look at the date on the document?
Hamid Moslehi: I looked at the date of the document just right now, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And does it refresh your recollection that it was signed on February 14th, 2003?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Now, I gather from what you've said that you decided at some point that your role in this rebuttal documentary titled, “The Michael Jackson Interview: The Footage You Were Never Meant To See”, was to be both participant and help film portions of it, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Would you repeat that one more time?
Mr. Mesereau: Yeah, and I think -- I think you've said this. You were both interviewed to appear in it, and you also were doing footage yourself?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. And I believe you told the prosecutor that the footage you took of the Arvizos you decided to retain yourself at some point, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I -- well, what happened is, it remained in my possession and it was not turned over that night.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. And one of the reasons was you wanted to make sure you got paid, right?
Hamid Moslehi: One of the reasons, if I remember correctly, was that Mr. Jackson's managers, his agents, they promised me certain things.
Mr. Mesereau: Right.
Hamid Moslehi: And they did not fulfill their promise.
Mr. Mesereau: So you thought you would get paid either that night or the next day, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that didn't happen?
Hamid Moslehi: That didn't happen.
Mr. Mesereau: So you were retaining control of the video to make sure you were paid properly, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I figured I did everything that I promised them, but they not fulfill their promise, so I'm going to stop doing whatever I was doing until I get paid.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, how many interviews did you do yourself to help prepare the rebuttal show?
Hamid Moslehi: How many interviews I shot, or --
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, how many did you shoot? You, yourself.
Hamid Moslehi: Of other people?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: For that rebuttal documentary?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. You did the Arvizos, obviously.
Hamid Moslehi: We did Arvizos. We did Mr. Jackson's parents. I believe Debbie Rowe.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Mr. Jackson's makeup artist.
Mr. Mesereau: That's Karen Faye?
Hamid Moslehi: Karen Faye.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: That's what I remember right now.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall whether or not you did an interview with Mr. Jackson's physician? Pardon me, I'm sorry, that's not -- that's not phrased well. Do you recall whether or not you filmed any footage of an interview with Mr. Jackson's physician?
Hamid Moslehi: Do you have a name? Because Mr. Jackson has a lot of physicians.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall doing anything like that?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Not any physicians that I remember.
Mr. Mesereau: And were you involved with Brad Lachman Productions while you were doing these filmings?
Hamid Moslehi: I had some involvement with them.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And what was the involvement you had with Brad Lachman Productions?
Hamid Moslehi: Providing footage to them from Mr. Jackson's archival office and some new footage that we were shooting.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Now, was it your understanding that you would be paid for the actual interview you did?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You were expecting payment for the film footage that you did, right?
Hamid Moslehi: For my services.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, okay. All right. And I believe you testified that the footage of the Arvizos that you did never appeared in that television documentary, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you, yourself, deal with anybody from FOX when it came to preparing this documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall at one point complaining that Martin Bashir had used footage of you in his televised interview with Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: Did I ever complain?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: To who?
Mr. Mesereau: To anyone, that you had appeared in this documentary without your permission.
Hamid Moslehi: I discussed with some people that I was in that documentary without my permission, but I wasn't really complaining, because, you know, it's just --
Mr. Mesereau: But your position certainly was that you had appeared in the Bashir documentary without any permission from you, right?
Hamid Moslehi: I did not sign anything to Martin Bashir to use me in that video, but then he did and -- you know, it was okay with me.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever send a letter to anyone complaining about the fact that Bashir had used you in his documentary without your permission?
Hamid Moslehi: Send any letter?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, about the unauthorized use of your likeness by Bashir.
Hamid Moslehi: I received a letter from Mr. Jackson's lawyer asking me to sign that document that you're talking about.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: But I never did.
Mr. Mesereau: You never did, okay.
Hamid Moslehi: I never did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But your position at the time was he had used your likeness without any authorization from you?
Hamid Moslehi: He never ask me if we can do that, but he used it.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, he was not some friend of yours, was he, Mr. Bashir?
Hamid Moslehi: We became friends, kind of.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you remain friends?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: Did you remain friends?
Hamid Moslehi: After the air -- after the airing it?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: I guess not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: I've never seen the guy again.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. Around March of 2003, you were represented by a law firm named Greenberg Traurig, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: March 2003, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And Greenberg Traurig is a large law firm with different offices around the country, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And they were representing you in your desire to get paid, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And you were asking to be paid for the work you did, right?
Hamid Moslehi: For my services and out-of-pocket expenses.
Mr. Mesereau: But you were also asking for more money than that, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: What do you mean by that?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, your lawyer claimed that you were promised you would be compensated above and beyond the moneys set forth in your invoices, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Mr. Jackson's managers, Ronald and Dieter --
Mr. Mesereau: Right.
Hamid Moslehi: -- they promised me percentage of the net profit of this -- of this documentary.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. So your position was that you not only should be paid what was in your invoices, but that you should be given a profit percentage of what was made on the whole show, right?
Hamid Moslehi: They promised me that all my invoices for the last year and a half that has not been paid at the time, approximately $250,000 --
Mr. Mesereau: Right.
Hamid Moslehi: -- will be paid in full, plus a percentage of the net profit.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. And obviously they never came through with that, did they?
Hamid Moslehi: They never fulfilled their promise.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And at some point did you learn that they had been caught stealing close to a million dollars from Mr. Jackson?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; assumes facts not in evidence.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: At some point did you ever learn that they were stealing anything from Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you were dealing with -- excuse me, I'm going -- sorry. Your lawyers were dealing with a lawyer for Mr. Jackson named David LeGrand, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And to your knowledge, Mr. LeGrand had an office in Las Vegas?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever talk to him personally yourself?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point you turned that over to your lawyers, right?
Hamid Moslehi: To my lawyer, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: To deal with him directly?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, when you say that Dieter and Konitzer promised you a net profit's interest in that rebuttal documentary, what did you believe “a net profit's interest” meant?
Hamid Moslehi: A percentage of, like, the gross sales or net profit of it, some sort.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that what Dieter and Konitzer promised you?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: The two of them?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And you took the position that you owned a copyright interest in the footage you had done, right?
Hamid Moslehi: What footage?
Mr. Mesereau: The footage that you did to put together the T.V. documentary about “The Footage You Were Never Meant To See”, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And what did you mean by your having a copyright interest?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm the author of this footage, and because no payment has ever made for those, I'm claiming ownership of it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. So you claim that you owned an interest in footage that was used in that television documentary, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you ever see that television documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: “The Footage You Were Never Meant To See”?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was narrated by Maury Povich, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When did you first meet Dieter?
Hamid Moslehi: The very first time?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: 1996.
Mr. Mesereau: So you knew Dieter before he was doing anything for Mr. Jackson, correct?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; assumes facts.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: I met Mr. Dieter during the History tour, Mr. Jackson's world tour, and his position was merchandising.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. He said he was trying to merchandise something involving Mr. Jackson, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: He was doing the merchandising of that tour, I believe.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: With a promoter.
Mr. Mesereau: With a promoter you said?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And who was the promoter, if you know?
Hamid Moslehi: Avram.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Forgot his name. Mr. Avram.
Mr. Mesereau: After you met him in 1996, did you do any business with Dieter, other than what you have described today?
Hamid Moslehi: After 1996?
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase it. Bad question. You met him in 1996, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: After you met him in 1996, did you do any business with him?
Hamid Moslehi: Until like from 1996 till sometime -- I mean, are you giving me a time frame or --
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Between the time you first met Dieter in 1996 --
Hamid Moslehi: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: -- and the events you've described today --
Hamid Moslehi: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: -- did you personally do any other business with him?
Hamid Moslehi: “Business” meaning financial business-type of -- no. No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have any involvement with him at all between the time you met him in 1996 and the events you've described today?
Hamid Moslehi: When you say “involvement”, what do you mean by that?
Mr. Mesereau: Were you in communication with him at all?
Hamid Moslehi: Sometimes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did you start communicating with him after you first met him in 1996?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, just an example would be we're on the tour, and he's doing merchandising --
Mr. Mesereau: Right.
Hamid Moslehi: -- and we will just see each other and say “Hi” at a venue, let's say, and he would show like the new jackets that he designed and things like that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Basically that kind of -- that kind of, you know, interaction.
Mr. Mesereau: Right. After the tour ended, when did you next communicate with Dieter?
Hamid Moslehi: I would see Dieter once in a while --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: -- with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that would be in Los Angeles?
Hamid Moslehi: Various locations.
Mr. Mesereau: And your understanding was that he was trying to merchandise memorabilia, jackets, things like that, involving the name “Michael Jackson”, right?
Hamid Moslehi: For the tour.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Okay. Your understanding was he was trying to merchandise products, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Products like jackets, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Jackets that were supposed to be associated with Michael Jackson, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Mr. Jackson's name would be on it.
Mr. Mesereau: Right. Right. And when did you first meet Konitzer, if you know?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe late 2002. I would say in November, December 2002.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You didn't meet him when you first met Dieter, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay.
The Court: All right. Let's take our afternoon recess. 8:30 tomorrow morning. Remember the admonitions.
