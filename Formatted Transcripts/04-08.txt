Message: ADRIAN MARIE McMANUS Having been previously sworn, resumed the stand and testified further as follows:
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION Continued BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Ms. McManus, your -- excuse me. Ms. McManus, your deposition in the Chandler lawsuit was on December 7th, 1993, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And the Complaint you filed against Michael Jackson, along with Ralph Chacon, was December 2nd, 1994, a year later, approximately a year later, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Would it refresh your recollection just to take a look at the Complaint?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay. Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, in that lawsuit, you were suing Mr. Jackson for a number of different claims, and one of the claims talked about you having appeared at a deposition taken by Larry Feldman, and the claim said that you were a potential material witness against Jackson in both the civil suit and a criminal investigation, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And what that really meant was, by filing that Complaint with that language, you were essentially threatening Mr. Jackson that you would change your testimony unless you were paid, right?
Adrian McManus: I'm not familiar with a lot of attorney language, so I really don't know how to answer that.
Mr. Mesereau: How much money do you recall you were seeking from Mr. Jackson in that lawsuit?
Adrian McManus: That's another question I cannot answer. That was dealing with my attorney.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you were in court when he argued to the Santa Maria jury for millions of dollars, right?
Adrian McManus: I don't even know if I was there at that time. I could have been. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: You certainly must have discussed with your attorney during that six-month trial how much money you were trying to get for yourself from Mr. Jackson, right?
Adrian McManus: Honestly, I don't believe anybody knew how much money anybody would be getting out of a trial.
Mr. Mesereau: But how much did you want?
Adrian McManus: I really didn't want anything. I just wanted justice for what I had gone through.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't want millions of dollars in that lawsuit?
Adrian McManus: I wanted justice. I didn't -- whatever -- I wanted justice.
Mr. Mesereau: But your idea of justice was millions of bucks, right?
Adrian McManus: Well, that's not what I call justice.
Mr. Mesereau: You file a lawsuit, you go through approximately eight days of depositions, all sorts of paperwork, and you're in trial for six months. You wanted millions, right?
Adrian McManus: Honestly, a simple “Sorry for what we did to you” would have been great for me.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever write a letter to Mr. Jackson saying, “Mr. Jackson, I don't want to sue you. Just tell me you're sorry”?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever call Mr. Jackson and say, “Mr. Jackson, I don't really want to sue you. Just say you're sorry”?
Adrian McManus: I didn't have a number to contact Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When did you first go to the police to tell them you had seen anything improper about Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: I can't recall the date. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: It was after your deposition in the Chandler case, correct?
Adrian McManus: It might have been.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately when you first talked to anyone from the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department about your claim that you'd seen Mr. Jackson do anything improper?
Adrian McManus: You know, it might have been when I talked to my attorney, Mr. Ring. It might have been sometime then, that I can recall.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you did that, you thought going to the sheriffs would put pressure on Mr. Jackson to pay money in your civil case, right?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you go to the sheriffs with your attorney?
Adrian McManus: I don't believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: But certainly you went to an attorney before anyone from law enforcement, right?
Adrian McManus: Actually, I recall going to law enforcement to com -- to complain about the death threat that I got from James Van Norman and strange circumstances that were going on at Neverland Valley Ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: But that was also to bolster your claim for millions of dollars, right?
Adrian McManus: That was before I even contacted an attorney.
Mr. Mesereau: But by doing that, you were setting the stage for a lawsuit for millions of dollars against Mr. Jackson, correct?
Adrian McManus: No, I was not.
Mr. Mesereau: You went to tabloids, a lawyer, and the sheriffs, all to get millions of bucks, right?
Adrian McManus: You're wrong.
Mr. Zonen: Objection; compound.
The Court: The answer was, “You're wrong”. Overruled. Next question.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know Leslie Gomez?
Adrian McManus: No, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know she was the manager of McFrugal's?
Adrian McManus: I think I know her as Beaver. That's the name I think I'm thinking of.
Mr. Mesereau: You told her you had never seen Michael Jackson act inappropriately with children, right?
Adrian McManus: I've never talked to her about Michael Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Leslie Gomez that, “The suit by that kid”, meaning Mr. Chandler, “was a bunch of bull”, right?
Adrian McManus: I've never told -- I've never talked to her about anything to do with lawsuits or anything with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know someone named Ludi Trujillo?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Ludi Trujillo is your former boss at Gottschalk's, right?
Adrian McManus: No, she was not.
Mr. Mesereau: Who is she?
Adrian McManus: She's a girl that worked at Gottschalk's. Just a lady.
Mr. Mesereau: She didn't have any position above you?
Adrian McManus: No, she did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You talked to her about the Chandler lawsuit, didn't you?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: She asked you specifically if Mr. Jackson ever molested children, and you told her, “Of course Michael did not”, right?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: You told her Michael Jackson was a great boss, didn't you?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know someone named Jamie Vail?
Adrian McManus: No, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't Jamie Vail live across the street from you?
Adrian McManus: Where was this? I don't know the name.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember telling someone named Jamie Vail that you loved Michael Jackson, you love working at the ranch, and you never believed any of the charges against him?
Adrian McManus: I don't even know that person.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know who Gayle Goforth is?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: And who is Gayle Goforth?
Adrian McManus: She was a supervisor that worked at Neverland Valley Ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember Gayle asked you if there was anything to rumors about inappropriate conduct by Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: She never -- we never talked about that, no.
Mr. Mesereau: In the autumn of 1993, you told her there was no truth to those rumors about Mr. Jackson acting inappropriately, right?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you and Ralph Chacon and Kassim Abdool started meeting secretly at Neverland to talk about your lawsuit, didn't you?
Adrian McManus: No, we did not.
Mr. Mesereau: You and Ralph Chacon and Kassim Abdool began to meet at Neverland to discuss the possibility of selling stories to the media, right?
Adrian McManus: No, we did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever discuss selling a story to the media with Ralph Chacon?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: When you were working at Neverland, did you ever learn that Ralph Chacon was thinking of selling any story about Michael Jackson to the media?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you first hear anything about Ralph Chacon's willingness to go to the media with information about Michael Jackson?
Adrian McManus: The only time that we all sold a story was when we were already in our lawsuit with Mr. Jackson, which was with Mr. Ring, our attorney.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, at some point, you learned that Blanca Francia had sold a story to Hard Copy, correct?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: She sold her information before you sold yours, right?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall when Bianca -- Blanca sold the story.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know someone named Charli Michaels?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Who is Charli Michaels?
Adrian McManus: She was a security guard for Neverland Valley Ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever hear information that Charli Michaels was trying to sell a story about Michael Jackson to the media?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: To date, have you ever heard anything about that?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever have a discussion with Charli Michaels about the possibility of making money from information you'd learned at Neverland?
Adrian McManus: No. I only recall talking to Charli about her having sexual harassment with people at the ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you and she never said anything about the possibility of making a buck from the media, correct?
Adrian McManus: No. No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, when you were at Neverland, you learned that security guards at the Encino home of the Jacksons on Havenhurst had sold stories for approximately $100,000, right?
Adrian McManus: No, I never heard that.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew they had sold stories about Michael Jackson, didn't you?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to object as asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know someone named Francine Orosco?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: And who is Francine Orosco?
Adrian McManus: She was a maid for Neverland Valley Ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point, she was a personal friend of yours, was she not?
Adrian McManus: We became friends, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you knew that she became a witness against your claims in the lawsuit, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: She said you were never sexually harassed by anybody, right?
Mr. Zonen: I'll object as hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you repeatedly tell Francine Orosco that Michael Jackson was innocent of any charge of molestation?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling Francine Orosco that you were going to get big-time money in your lawsuit against Michael Jackson?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: And you tried to convince her to say that she had seen acts of sexual harassment involving you, right?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: While you worked at Neverland, Francine Orosco visited you at home, did she not?
Adrian McManus: Maybe one time.
Mr. Mesereau: And you showed her a room in your house filled with watches, posters, clocks, sunglasses, T-shirts and other items you had taken from Neverland, correct?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You showed her laundry baskets filled with Michael Jackson's clothes that you had taken from Neverland, right?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember one time at Neverland when a box of black felt hats came for Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: I can't recall that.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember that box of hats had Michael Jackson's name printed on the inside of the rim of the hats?
Adrian McManus: I know he had hats, but I don't recall the hats being sent there.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember taking a hat and saying you were going to bring it home?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you used to take food home from the theater, did you not?
Adrian McManus: Food, like what are you talking about? Dinners?
Mr. Mesereau: Candy?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never took bags of candy home?
Adrian McManus: There was a time when -- you say “take”, you're saying like -- you're saying I'm just going to take it, that is not correct. There was a time when Gayle Goforth, a supervisor, went down to the theater and took a lot of the candy from there, because it was expired. She brought it back to the maids, the maids' room, and she let all the maids take candy that was expired. She also gave it to security. That was the only time.
Mr. Mesereau: So you never stole any candy from Michael Jackson?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember around Christmastime when you worked at Neverland, Mr. Jackson used to purchase toys for needy children?
Adrian McManus: I believe he did.
Mr. Mesereau: And they tended to be fairly expensive toys, did they not?
Adrian McManus: I really don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: You took some of those toys home, did you not?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not. That was Janelle Wahl.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me?
Adrian McManus: That was Janelle Wahl that would take that.
Mr. Mesereau: You never took any Super Soaker guns home?
Adrian McManus: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, these are the kinds of things the jury found that you had actually done, correct?
Adrian McManus: I don't believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, they found that you had stolen from Mr. Jackson, correct?
Adrian McManus: I believe it was what they thought I had stolen was that sketch that I found in the trash.
Mr. Mesereau: And you're saying you didn't steal that either, right?
Adrian McManus: I didn't. I found it in the trash.
Mr. Mesereau: That's the sketch of Elvis?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You complained at Neverland that you should be paid more, right?
Adrian McManus: I don't believe I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Never said that to anybody?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall saying that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you say you left voluntarily, correct?
Adrian McManus: I left after the harassment and the death threats, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And then you filed a claim for disability with EDD, right?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Ralph Chacon stopped working at Neverland the same day you stopped, right?
Adrian McManus: I don't believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Kassim Abdool stopped working there the same day you stopped, didn't he?
Adrian McManus: I don't believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: All -- excuse me. Now, you sued someone named Bill Bray, correct?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And who is Bill Bray?
Adrian McManus: He was the -- how would you say it? Maybe the top man for the Office of Special Services.
Mr. Mesereau: You sued Betty Bailey, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And who was Betty Bailey?
Adrian McManus: She was maybe like his right hand.
Mr. Mesereau: And you sued Mr. Jackson's personal security people, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: You sued Jimmy Van Norman, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Marcus Johnson, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Tony Coleman?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And Jerome J.J. Johnson, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point you approached Mr. Johnson about testifying for you, right?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Someone on your behalf did, right?
Adrian McManus: All I know is that I believe that, from what I understand, he jumped onto our side and decided to tell the truth about what was going on.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you say he “decided to tell the truth”, you dropped your suit against him, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe we did.
Mr. Mesereau: And the jury didn't believe him either, right?
Mr. Zonen: Objection.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: He never testified. Assumes facts not in evidence that he testified.
The Court: I sustained your objection.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember when Mr. Johnson got in trouble for sending an extortion letter to Mr. Jackson asking for three million dollars?
Adrian McManus: I did learn of that through the later part of my deposition, which I knew nothing about.
Mr. Mesereau: At the point where you learned about Mr. Johnson's $3 million extortion letter to Mr. Jackson, were you working with him on your lawsuit?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You stole commemorative Pepsi cans from Neverland, did you not?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: You were accused of that, right?
Adrian McManus: No, I was not.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know someone name Peter Burt?
Adrian McManus: No, I do not.
Mr. Mesereau: Never heard the name?
Adrian McManus: I've heard of the name, but I do not know him.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You do know Sandie Domz, do you not?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Who is Sandie Domz?
Adrian McManus: She was an office administrator, a secretary for Neverland Valley Ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: You and the other plaintiffs in that lawsuit decided that she would go to the show Hard Copy to try and sell a story, correct?
Adrian McManus: Not that I ever recall.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you saying that didn't happen, or you just don't remember?
Adrian McManus: That did not happen.
Mr. Mesereau: So you never got together and said, “We'll split money that we could get from Hard Copy”?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Sanger: Inside Edition. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Mesereau: How much in total did Mr. Ring collect on your behalf from tabloids or media?
Adrian McManus: From what I recall from my deposition, which there were stubs in my deposition, that showed, I'm thinking, maybe 32,000.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did any of that go to you?
Adrian McManus: 1,000.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you spent days being interviewed by a book author named Mr. Gutierrez, right?
Adrian McManus: Days being interviewed?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you interviewed by a book author named Mr. Gutierrez?
Adrian McManus: I never was interviewed, but I did meet with him.
Mr. Mesereau: And approximately when did you meet with him?
Adrian McManus: You know, I cannot recall the date.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you certainly had a discussion with him about the fact that he was writing a book, didn't you?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: So when you met with him, you didn't know he was writing a book?
Adrian McManus: No, when I met with him, he was going to try to help us in our lawsuit.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn he was writing a book about Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: I never -- I don't recall him saying that he was writing a book. I don't remember that.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you give him information about Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: Um, later I did.
Mr. Mesereau: When you first talked to the Santa Barbara Sheriffs, you didn't tell them about inappropriate behavior you'd seen by Mr. Jackson, correct?
Adrian McManus: Probably not.
Mr. Mesereau: You waited to say that in your lawsuit, correct?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: Going back to your deposition in the Chandler suit - okay? --
Adrian McManus: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: -- you were asked if you'd ever seen Wade Robson at the ranch without one of his parents, and you said, “No”, right?
Adrian McManus: I don't -- I have not gone over that, so I do not recall what I've said or --
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to just take a look at the page?
Adrian McManus: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said under oath in that deposition?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And on that issue, what did you say?
Adrian McManus: “No”.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you had never seen Wade Robson at the ranch without one of his parents, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You were asked if you had ever seen Brett Barnes' clothes in Mr. Jackson's bedroom, right?
Adrian McManus: If it's there. Like I said, I have not gone over that.
Mr. Mesereau: And your response was sometimes his mother would give you his clothes to wash, right?
Adrian McManus: Yeah, probably.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that what you remember saying?
Adrian McManus: Like I said, I have not gone over that in probably ten years.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to just take a look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said that his mother would give you his clothes, correct?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't see his clothes in Mr. Jackson's bedroom, right?
Adrian McManus: Um --
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me, at that point in time, you said you didn't see his clothes in Mr. Jackson's bedroom, his mother would give you his clothes, correct?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You also said you'd never seen any of the Culkin boys' clothes in Mr. Jackson's bedroom, right?
Adrian McManus: If it's there, that's probably what I said at that time.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me just go back a little bit. You said that you saw Macaulay Culkin and his brother at Neverland, right?
Adrian McManus: I probably did.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. May I approach?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay. Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said on that topic?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said that you had never seen the Culkin boys' clothes in Mr. Jackson's bedroom, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You also told Mr. Feldman that you had never come to Mr. Jackson's room in the morning and seen anything that indicated somebody may have slept on his floor, right?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall. Sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
Adrian McManus: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does that refresh your recollection about what you said?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what did you say?
Adrian McManus: “No”.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember testifying that Mr. Jackson had never given you money?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall that. I don't --
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. Jackson give you money from time to time?
Adrian McManus: No. There was just one time.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that was when you told the jury that you got 300 bucks to lie in a deposition?
Adrian McManus: That --
Mr. Zonen: Objection; misstates the testimony of the witness.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase that.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell the jury that Mr. Jackson gave you $300 to lie in a deposition?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; misstatement of evidence.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Adrian McManus: What I said was the $300 was given to me after Mr. Jackson had read the transcripts of Jordie Chandler.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you interpreted that as a token of his appreciation?
Adrian McManus: Yes, for covering up for him.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. 300 bucks?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember being asked if you'd ever seen a woman in Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Adrian McManus: I can't recall that.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you had seen June Chandler in his bedroom, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe to bring in Jordie's clothes.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, let me just go step by step. You testified under oath in the deposition that you had seen June Chandler in Mr. Jackson's bedroom, right?
Adrian McManus: To bring in his clothes, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you had never seen Mr. Jackson and June Chandler in any romantic relationship, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You weren't aware of her sleeping with Mr. Jackson, right?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: But you saw her in his room?
Adrian McManus: To bring in the clothes, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you didn't say “to bring in the clothes” in the deposition, right?
Adrian McManus: I don't know what's in the deposition.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Zonen: I'll object as irrelevant and hearsay.
Mr. Mesereau: I think the prosecution raised the issue of what was happening in that bedroom.
The Court: I'll allow you to refresh her recollection.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page of your deposition?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said about June Chandler being in Mr. Jackson's room?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you had seen June Chandler in his room, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't explain it in terms of her coming there for clothes, or with clothes, right?
Adrian McManus: I guess not, no.
Mr. Mesereau: You testified that you had seen Jordie Chandler and Michael Jackson together outside on a Jet Ski in the water, right?
Adrian McManus: I probably did.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember that?
Adrian McManus: Slightly.
Mr. Mesereau: You indicated you had seen Mr. Jackson in water balloon fights and squirt gun fights, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And you saw that once in a while, didn't you, while you worked there?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: He would do that with kids all the time, wouldn't he?
Adrian McManus: Yeah, sometimes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your impression that Mr. Jackson liked water balloon fights?
Mr. Zonen: I'll object as speculative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you had never seen Mr. Jackson hold hands with anyone at the ranch, right?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall that.
Mr. Mesereau: Could I refresh your recollection --
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: -- by showing you the page?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you'd never seen Michael Jackson hold hands with anybody at the ranch, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, there was approximately a one-year period between this deposition and the actual filing of your lawsuit against Mr. Jackson, right?
Adrian McManus: Are you talking about Jordie Chandler?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, approximately a one-year period between your deposition in the Chandler case and the filing of your lawsuit, correct?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the Chandler deposition was in December, and the next December you filed your lawsuit, right?
Adrian McManus: I know the Chandler one was probably December 7th of -- oh, gosh, I don't know if it was '93 or '94. I don't -- I'm not -- I don't know the dates.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. We talked about a little earlier that December 7th, 1993, is the deposition in the Chandler case.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: And your lawsuit is December 2nd, 1994?
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, how long after the Feldman deposition in the Chandler case did you to go a lawyer to talk about suing?
Adrian McManus: I don't know how long after it was. I just -- I know I left Neverland in the end of July of '94. It might have been -- I don't even want to guess because I'm not real -- I'm not sure.
Mr. Mesereau: You must have had a lot of meetings with Mr. Ring before you actually finalized the lawsuit, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know roughly when that started?
Adrian McManus: You know, in my head, I don't know why I keep thinking 1995, but I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: For how many months do you think you and Ralph Chacon and Kassim Abdool met with Mr. Ring before the action was filed?
Adrian McManus: I really can't answer that, because I really don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Approximately when did you stop working at Neverland?
Adrian McManus: The exact date -- my last day, I believe, was July the 31st of '94.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall participating in an Inside Edition show?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did you participate in a show about Mr. Jackson for Inside Edition?
Adrian McManus: I believe that had to do when we contacted Gary Morgan. That was all around the same time, so our lawsuit had already been going on.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember meeting with representatives of Inside Edition?
Adrian McManus: I remember -- I remember those -- the people from Inside Edition showing up at our attorney's office, so I guess, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you meet with them with your lawyer?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And was Ralph Chacon in that meeting?
Adrian McManus: You know what, I really can't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: Was Kassim Abdool in that meeting?
Adrian McManus: I don't want to say yes, because I can't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: But the subject was Mr. Jackson, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes, it was.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember trying to sell information about Mr. Jackson's relationship with Ms. Presley?
Adrian McManus: There could have been something of that. Possibly, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You say, “Possibly, yes”?
Adrian McManus: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, I mean, you were actually trying to get money from tabloids in return for your giving them personal information about Mr. Jackson's relationship with Miss Presley, right?
Adrian McManus: We were trying to get money to help with our lawsuit to fight Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall ever going to anyone in the media and telling them you had inside information on Mr. Jackson's relationship with Miss Presley?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall ever giving information to anyone in the media involving Miss Presley and Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: I believe we probably did with Gary Morgan.
Mr. Mesereau: And he was your media broker, wasn't he?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: He was the one that you were using and Ralph Chacon was using to find media outlets to sell information to, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you met him through Attorney Ring; is that correct?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever see any tabloids that quoted you about Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: I -- I could have.
Mr. Mesereau: You're not sure?
Adrian McManus: I'm not real, real sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see any tabloids that quoted you about Mr. Jackson's relationship with Miss Presley?
Adrian McManus: I could have. It's been a long time. I kind of can't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember Star magazine asking you to sign a contract whereby you would give them information about Mr. Jackson and his relationship with his wife, Lisa Marie Presley?
Adrian McManus: I remember something to do with Gary Morgan and something with Star, but I don't remember everything that was discussed with that.
Mr. Mesereau: Might it refresh your recollection if I just show you that document?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that document?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it appear to be a contract with Star magazine?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you signed that, correct?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And among other things, you agreed to provide information about Mr. Jackson's relationship with Lisa Marie Presley, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And Ralph Chacon signed that, did he not?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you've heard the name Splash, correct?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And who was Splash?
Adrian McManus: I really -- all I know about Splash is that it was linked up with Gary Morgan, so I don't know a lot of this tabloid stuff. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, Splash was an agency, was it not, that was retained by you to find media sources, right?
Adrian McManus: If it was retained, it would have been with Michael Ring, my attorney.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You signed an agreement with Splash News and Picture Agency, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And was your involvement with Splash always through Mr. Ring?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever deal with Splash directly?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: How long were you working with Splash?
Adrian McManus: I have no idea. I don't know the dates.
Mr. Mesereau: At some point -- at some point did your relationship with Splash end?
Adrian McManus: I'm sure it did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know approximately when?
Adrian McManus: No, I do not.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you giving information to any tabloids or media sources during your trial?
Adrian McManus: Only through Splash.
Mr. Mesereau: And that went on during the trial, right?
Adrian McManus: Probably sometime during the trial, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall trying to sell what you called “Mr. Jackson's sex secrets”? Do you remember that?
Adrian McManus: I know something was written about that, but I know sometimes tabloids write other stuff that they like to put in, so I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: You were quoted in an issue of Star magazine titled “Five of His Closest Servants Tell All. Kinky Sex Secrets of Michael and Lisa Marie's Bedroom”, right?
Adrian McManus: I don't believe I said that.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you seen that article before?
Adrian McManus: I did during my deposition.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that the first time you'd ever seen this article?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You are quoted in the article, correct?
Adrian McManus: I don't know. I could be. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you --
Adrian McManus: Sure, you can.
Mr. Mesereau: May I, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Kind of hard to see that. Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that article?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about you being quoted in that article?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You were going to tabloids and saying that you were the only person with a key to Mr. Jackson's bedroom and you had information to sell, right?
Adrian McManus: Um, as I've said, I know we did interview -- the interview with Gary Morgan. But a lot of the times with those tabloids, those tabloids write other stuff and put it in there, and it makes it look like I said it, when I didn't say it. So I don't know how to answer that.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, did he have authorization from you to quote you with various tabloids?
Adrian McManus: You know what, that's where I don't know. He was dealing with Michael Ring, so I really don't know. I kind of got stuck in the middle.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, at some point you must have known that your quotes were appearing in tabloids regarding Mr. Jackson, true?
Mr. Zonen: Assumes facts not in evidence that there were quotes.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: During the time you were represented by Attorney Ring, did you learn from time to time that your name and various quotes about Mr. Jackson were appearing in the media?
Adrian McManus: Just through the Gary Morgan deal. That's all I recall.
Mr. Mesereau: What I'm trying to find out is this: Did you sort of leave it to other people to sort of quote you when they wanted in the media?
Adrian McManus: Actually, sometimes you have no control over what people quote you in the media.
Mr. Mesereau: But you're not saying you had nothing to do with these quotes, are you?
Adrian McManus: I can't answer that, because I don't know what was quoted.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You never learned?
Adrian McManus: No. Huh-uh.
Mr. Mesereau: During your trial with Mr. Jackson, were you speaking to various newscasters?
Adrian McManus: Only Gary Morgan is all that I recall, and when we met with Victor Gutierrez, and that was it.
Mr. Mesereau: Would he arrange meetings for you?
Adrian McManus: Victor Gutierrez?
Mr. Mesereau: No, Mr. Morgan.
Adrian McManus: I believe he might have, through Mr. Ring.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it -- let me rephrase that. Was it typical during your relationship with Mr. Morgan that he would fax a story to you to have you review it, and ask you to see if you wanted any changes, and then you would fax it back?
Adrian McManus: What I recall is viewing one -- I don't know what you call it, I don't know if it was a transcript, and that's the only thing I remember seeing.
Mr. Mesereau: Did the group used to meet with Mr. Morgan?
Adrian McManus: The only time we all met was with Mr. Ring at his office.
Mr. Mesereau: And you had a number of meetings with Mr. Ring, Mr. Morgan, and the group that was suing Michael Jackson, true?
Adrian McManus: Maybe two meetings that I can recall.
Mr. Mesereau: And Ralph Chacon was at those meetings, right?
Adrian McManus: He might have been at one. I don't know if he was at all of them.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you last talk to Ralph Chacon?
Adrian McManus: It's been a while. I don't know, maybe -- I really can't -- it's been a while.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you last talk to Kassim Abdool?
Adrian McManus: Actually, the last time I spoke with Kassim was during our verdict, when we lost, and I have not seen him since.
Mr. Mesereau: How about Melanie Bagnall?
Adrian McManus: I see her off and on.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall your being quoted in any Australian newspapers about Mr. Jackson's private life?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your understanding that Mr. Morgan was going to try and use your quotes in foreign newspapers about Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: I have no idea.
Mr. Mesereau: How many television shows do you think you appeared on where you purported to give private information about Michael Jackson?
Adrian McManus: The only thing that I can recall that I appeared on was maybe with Inside -- I think it was Inside Edition. There wasn't an interview with me, but I think they captured me walking, maybe, with -- I don't know if it was Kassim.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall meeting with any representative of the media while you worked at Neverland?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And you're telling the jury that you never had any discussion with any employee while you worked at Neverland about what you could make by selling a story?
Adrian McManus: The only thing I recall when I worked at Neverland was one of the maids, Francine Orosco, had contacted the media. I don't know if it was -- it was one of the tabloids and they had offered her $2,000, and she was going to come out and talk, but they wanted her picture. And she was considering doing that. That's the only thing I ever remember with that.
Mr. Mesereau: Finally, when did you last talk to anyone representing any media outlet about Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: I have not interviewed with anybody about Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: I don't mean an interview. I mean when have you last spoken with anyone who purported to represent the media?
Adrian McManus: I haven't really been talking to anybody about anything in the -- with the media.
Mr. Mesereau: Has anyone called you from the media?
Adrian McManus: I did get a call from somebody from London at my job, and they wanted to interview, and I told them no.
Mr. Mesereau: When was that?
Adrian McManus: Maybe about -- within the last week.
Mr. Mesereau: And you didn't interview because there is a court order in this case that you're not allowed to do that if you're a witness, right?
Adrian McManus: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you agree with them that on a future date you may speak to them?
Adrian McManus: I told them that I was not interested in doing any interviews, that I was under a gag order.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions at this time.
The Court: Redirect?
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: Mr. Mesereau asked you some questions about an article that was in a tabloid that quotes you as saying that you have all kinds of information about kinky sex secrets between Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. He showed you that article and asked you if it refreshed your recollection as to whether there was, in fact, such an article, and you said yes, it refreshed your recollection as to that article. About the quotations in the article, are they accurate?
Adrian McManus: No, they are not.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever give information about kinky sex secrets between Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley to any publication, any media, or any reporter?

Mr. Zonen: You told Mr. Mesereau about June Chandler unpacking clothing in Mr. Jackson's bedroom. Did that, in fact, happen?
Adrian McManus: Yes, it did.
Mr. Zonen: Explain that to us, please.
Adrian McManus: June Chandler had gone into Mr. Jackson's room and brought in suitcases of Jordie Chandler's clothes, since he was staying with Mr. Jackson in his bedroom.
Mr. Zonen: I guess that begs the question, Miss Chandler obviously knew that her son was sleeping in that room, correct?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; calls for speculation.
The Court: Argumentative; sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Did she do this on more than one occasion?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: Was there a dresser or a drawer set up for Jordie's clothing?
Adrian McManus: No. The clothes would just get put anywhere in the room.

Adrian McManus: Not that I can recall.
Mr. Zonen: You testified in the deposition that you had not seen Wade Robson on the property without a parent. Was that a correct statement?

Mr. Zonen: Who was the parent that was always there?
Adrian McManus: His mother.
Mr. Zonen: And you never met the father?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Your initial conversations with the sheriff's office, were they at a time that you were still employed at Neverland Ranch?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: You testified in the deposition that Brett Barnes' mother would bring you his clothes to wash. Was that, in fact, true?
Adrian McManus: At times that was true.
Mr. Zonen: Was that always the manner in which you washed his clothes?

Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Had you ever seen them in bed together?

Adrian McManus: He was staying with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever actually see either Michael Jackson or Brett Barnes in bed in Michael Jackson's room?

Mr. Zonen: Do you have a recollection of that?

Mr. Zonen: What did you see?
Adrian McManus: I brought breakfast and they were sitting in the bed.
Mr. Zonen: Both of them together?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you recall how they were dressed?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall.
Mr. Zonen: Were they in the bed, under the covers, or --
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: They were in the bed under the covers?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: You testified that you never saw Jordie Chandler either get ready for bed or get up in the morning. Were either of those statements true?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Both of them?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: You testified that you never saw a chimp in his bedroom. Was that statement true?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: In fact, you'd been bitten by a chimp in his bedroom; is that true?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you used to clean up after the monkeys?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever have to change their diapers?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever have to clean up monkey droppings on the floors?
Adrian McManus: Not on the floor. Just on the walls.

Mr. Zonen: What did he do?
Adrian McManus: Mr. Jackson would rub his fingers through my son's hair.
Mr. Zonen: Did that concern you at the time?
Adrian McManus: A little bit, yeah. I was a little upset.
Mr. Zonen: I have no further questions.
Mr. Mesereau: Very briefly.
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: You tried to sell a story to a tabloid about Mr. Jackson putting his fingers through your son's hair, didn't you?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: You tried to sell stories to tabloids about your son's experiences at Neverland, correct?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall Mr. Jackson living at Lisa Marie Presley's home during the week, and Lisa Marie Presley visiting on weekends during the time that you worked at Neverland?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You saw her there?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever see Brooke Shields there before Lisa Marie Presley?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I -- I saw Brooke Shields, but I don't know if it was before.

Mr. Auchincloss: Phillip LeMarque would be our next witness, Your Honor.
The Court: Remain standing. Raise your right hand. Face the clerk here.
Message: PHILLIP LeMARQUE Having been sworn, testified as follows:
Phillip LeMarque: I do.
The Clerk: Please be seated. State and spell your name for the record.
Phillip LeMarque: My name is Phillip LeMarque. P-h-i-l-l-i-p; LeMarque, L-e-M-a-r-q-u-e.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me, Your Honor. I think we have that issue that was raised.
The Court: That doesn't come up until your exam.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:
Mr. Auchincloss: Good morning, Mr. LeMarque. Where did you work in 1991?
Phillip LeMarque: At the Neverland Valley.
Mr. Auchincloss: And who was your employer?
Phillip LeMarque: Michael Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is he the man seated to my right?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: How long did you work at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: Oh, somewhere around ten months or more. Somewhere like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did you do at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: Was in charge of the food. Majordomo of the food. And my wife was the cook.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. What do you mean by “majordomo of the food”?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, in charge of serving the food and preparing and organizing for the guests and so forth.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you said your wife also worked there at the same time?
Phillip LeMarque: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where did you live while you were living -- or while you were working at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: We were living at the ranch.
Mr. Auchincloss: Whereabouts at the ranch?
Phillip LeMarque: It was a house which is maybe -- was by the zoo.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you involved in serving the food as well as preparing it?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you said you left your employment there after about ten months?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes, somewhere around ten months.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why did you leave Neverland? Why did you leave the employment there?
Phillip LeMarque: There was an issue happening with Norma Stakos, who was Michael's private secretary.
The Court: All right. We're going to take a break.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. We have a morning break.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Counsel? Did you wish to address me?
Mr. Mesereau: Yeah, Your Honor. I believe the prosecutor filed a memorandum this morning regarding impeachment of this witness.
The Bailiff: No one can hear you.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, I'm sorry. Your Honor, the prosecutor filed a pleading this morning regarding impeachment of this particular witness.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And he has, as I understand it, requested that the defense not mention the fact that this witness has been in the --
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll ask --
Mr. Mesereau: -- the pornographic website business.
Mr. Auchincloss: May I object, and just ask that the Court -- the Court is aware of the issues. I don't think it's necessary to publish them.
The Court: That's true. He did -- not in the terms you just stated. For once you want to use “pornographic” when no one else wants to. It was the other way around recently. But what -- your point being?
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, we can prove that this witness tried to use tabloid stories about Mr. Jackson --
The Court: What's your argument against his position? I understand what you can prove. I think his position is well-taken. What's your argument?
Mr. Mesereau: My argument is that what we would like to show, Your Honor, is that he tried to use information allegedly about Mr. Jackson to get into this business.
The Court: All right. I'll sustain his objection. You cannot impeach him based on the work he did on that --
Mr. Mesereau: Website?
The Court: -- website after these incidents. All right. Bring in the jury.
Message: The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence and hearing of the jury:
The Court: Go ahead, Counsel.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. LeMarque, where we left off, we were talking about the reasons that you left your employment at Neverland.
Phillip LeMarque: The reason, there was some problem with Norma Stakos, who was Michael's secretary.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was that problem?
Phillip LeMarque: She wanted to have my wife to sign an affidavit stating that Bianca had been involved into looking into purses of other maids. And since my wife didn't see it, she didn't want to sign it.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you say Bianca was her name, do you know what her last name was?
Phillip LeMarque: No, I forgot.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did she have a different first name; do you know?
Phillip LeMarque: Not that I remember.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And what was this woman Bianca's -- what was her job at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: She was the private maid for Michael. She was the only one who could enter his room.
Mr. Auchincloss: So the affidavit that your wife was asked to sign was a false affidavit?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, it was false as far as my wife was concerned, because she never saw Bianca looking into any purses so --
Mr. Auchincloss: Did she believe that Bianca looked into any purses?
Phillip LeMarque: No, of course she didn't believe it.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And how much time transpired between the time that your wife was asked to sign this false affidavit and the time that you were asked to leave Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: We were -- we were not asked, really, to leave, but we had a conference with Norma a few days later, maybe three or four days, and Norma said I guess --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered to explain conduct only.
The Court: The question was how much time transpired between the signing of the affidavit, so it's not responsive to the question.
Mr. Auchincloss: That's fine.
Mr. Auchincloss: So let's go back to that first question. How much time between the time that you -- that your wife was asked to sign the false affidavit and the time that you actually left your employment at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: I would say four or five days.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Phillip LeMarque: Maybe a week. I don't know.
Mr. Auchincloss: And were you terminated from your employment?
Phillip LeMarque: No, we came into --
Mr. Auchincloss: That's just a “yes” or “no” question.
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: You were terminated?
Phillip LeMarque: (Nods head up and down.)
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Phillip LeMarque: No. Yes and no.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes and no. Okay. That's fine.
Phillip LeMarque: Common agreement.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why do you say, “Yes and no”?
Phillip LeMarque: Because it was a common agreement that we decided, since we didn't want to sign the affidavit, that was not a place for us to work.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. While you were at Neverland during that ten-month period, did you observe Mr. Jackson to have child visitors?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would these children spend the night at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: Some of them, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would any of them come with families?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would any of them come by themselves?
Phillip LeMarque: I think on one occasion I saw.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you notice whether or not Mr. Jackson would spend time equally with all the child visitors at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. Jackson show any special preference towards the children that visited him at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Auchincloss: You may answer.
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And was there anything in common that -- the children that Mr. Jackson showed preference to, was there anything in common that these children shared?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was that?
Phillip LeMarque: Little boys around 10, 11 years old.
Mr. Auchincloss: How would Mr. Jackson show preference to these 10- or 11-year-old boys?
Phillip LeMarque: He would spend most of his time with them.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would he ever buy them gifts?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he buy them more gifts than the other children?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm going to object. No foundation; move to strike.
Mr. Auchincloss: I can ask some additional questions on that.
The Court: On the question that he objected on, did he buy them more than any other children, I'll sustain the foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. LeMarque, were you ever asked by Mr. Jackson to go out and buy toys as gifts for these children?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: On how many occasions?
Phillip LeMarque: I don't -- several times.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And can you characterize the number of gifts that you would buy, the number of toys?
Phillip LeMarque: I would go to Toys-R-Us and pick out toys for boys of 10, 11 years old.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you instructed to buy such toys?
Phillip LeMarque: No, but I figured that was what they were for, so --
Mr. Auchincloss: And when you brought these toys to Mr. Jackson, did you have any occasion to see him give these toys as gifts to the children?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, usually they were put into an area or a tabletop where the kids would come in, you know, tear the papers off and pick up the toys.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you see Mr. Jackson give more toys to the boys than the other children?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah, they were mainly toys for boys.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. When Mr. Jackson had these children as guests at Neverland, what type of hours would they keep, in terms of time that they were spending together?
Phillip LeMarque: Sometimes all day, all night.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was it uncommon for him to stay up all night with the children?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah, it was very common.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where did the children sleep? And I'm talking specifically about the 10- or 11-year-old boys.
Phillip LeMarque: Mainly with Michael.
Mr. Auchincloss: Whereabouts?
Phillip LeMarque: I don't know, because we couldn't get into his apartment, so --
Mr. Auchincloss: But somewhere in his private --
Phillip LeMarque: In his quarters, yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- quarters?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Well, actually he didn't finish the question. I'll strike the answer and have you rephrase the question.
Mr. Auchincloss: My question was, you said that mainly they would sleep with Michael, and I was asking if that was in his private quarters.
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: During the time that you were employed at Neverland, did you ever see Michael Jackson sleep with anyone other than children?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. LeMarque, I show you People's Exhibit No. 721. Can you identify that for me, please?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who is that in that photograph?
Phillip LeMarque: Macaulay Culkin.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Macaulay Culkin visit Neverland while you were working there?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was he a guest of Mr. Jackson's?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he spend the night there?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: I show you two photographs which I've previously shown to counsel. The first one is People's Exhibit 800. Can you identify that for me, please?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes, this is the arcade.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And is that a fair representation of the floor plan of the arcade when you were working there?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are there some differences in terms of the items that are in this picture --
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- than the items that were in the arcade back when you worked there?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What would that be?
Phillip LeMarque: Some of the artifacts here were not there. And some of the games have been changed. I mean, they were different, a little bit different.
Mr. Auchincloss: But the floor plan is essentially the same?
Phillip LeMarque: The floor plan is the same, yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: I show you People's Exhibit 801. Same question. Can you identify that for me?
Phillip LeMarque: That's the arcade also. Different angle.
Mr. Auchincloss: And same distinctions?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah. Some of the artifacts have been changed and so forth. The pool table was there. And some of the toy -- the games are different.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Ask that People's 800 and 801 be admitted.
Mr. Mesereau: No objection.
The Court: Admitted.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. LeMarque, at some time during your employment, did you see something involving Mr. Jackson and one of these boys that upset you?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know the name of that boy?
Phillip LeMarque: Macaulay Culkin.
Mr. Auchincloss: And how long had you worked at Neverland when this incident occurred?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, I'm not too sure there. I mean, six, seven months maybe.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Where did this incident occur?
Phillip LeMarque: In the arcade.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was the approximate time of it?
Phillip LeMarque: Three o'clock in the morning. 3:00 or 4:00 or something. 3:30, maybe.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was it that you brought you to the -- the arcade is the photos that I just showed you?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was it that brought you to the arcade at approximately three o'clock in the morning?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, I was called by the security that Michael wanted some french fries.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Phillip LeMarque: So --
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you asleep at the time?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was that uncommon for you to get a food order in the middle of the night?
Phillip LeMarque: It happened a few times. Not too often.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Was this a telephone call that you received?
Phillip LeMarque: Was the -- yeah, I mean, we had the -- one of those remote control, I mean, phones.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Intercom, or --
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah, on the radio.
Mr. Auchincloss: Radio?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah, radio.
Mr. Auchincloss: And your instruction was to?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, yeah, at the time there was always a code for Michael. At the time it was “Silver Fox”. So they said that, “Silver Fox want some french fries”.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Phillip LeMarque: Okay. So --
Mr. Auchincloss: And was there a location you were told to bring these french fries to?
Phillip LeMarque: Not right away. When they were ready, I just called security again to find out where to deliver the french fries, and I was told to go to the teepee area. Which Michael wasn't there, so I called again, and they said that he probably was in the arcade.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Where was your wife during this time?
Phillip LeMarque: She was sleeping, home.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So she stayed in bed and you went down to the kitchen and made the french fries?
Phillip LeMarque: Right. That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you said you first heard they were at the teepee. Did you go to the teepees?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: And those are teepees located on Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah, they are. On the grounds.
Mr. Auchincloss: And no one was there?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: When did you learn that they -- that you were to deliver the french fries to the arcade?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, at that time I called security and I said, “Michael is not there. Where is he?” And they told me that he was at the arcade.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you go to the arcade?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you see when you went to the arcade?
Phillip LeMarque: Michael was playing with Macaulay Culkin at one of the games, which was a Thriller, the games.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thriller?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah. And he was holding the kid because the kid was small, couldn't reach the controls, so I guess he was holding him with two hands. The kids were up so they could use the controls of the game.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did you see that upset you?
Phillip LeMarque: His left hand was inside the pants of the kid.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. I want you to tell the jury specifically how his hands were configured on the boy's body.
Phillip LeMarque: Well, his right hand was holding the kid maybe mid-waist, and the left hand was down into the pants.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Now, what type of pants was Macaulay wearing?
Phillip LeMarque: I forgot what they were. They probably were shorts or something.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were his hands, as far as you could tell, on the inside or the outside of the shorts?
Phillip LeMarque: They were inside.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were they coming in the shorts from the top or from the bottom?
Phillip LeMarque: From the bottom.
Mr. Auchincloss: Through one of the legs?
Phillip LeMarque: Bottom.
Mr. Auchincloss: Which hand was it that he was touching the boy with?
Phillip LeMarque: Left hand.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you saw this, what did you do?
Phillip LeMarque: I was shocked, and I almost dropped the french fries. And there was a game there, Tip-Top, and I backed out --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Move to strike; nonresponsive.
The Court: Denied.
Mr. Auchincloss: As far as the exact location of his hand, could you see where his hand was in the vicinity of Mr. Macaulay's person?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, it was in the -- you know, in the crotch area.
Mr. Auchincloss: The crotch area? And you said they were playing this video game. Did this video game create any sound?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah, there was plenty of sound everywhere. I mean, all the machines were on and playing music and making sounds.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do other machines, or did other machines in that video arcade make sounds even though they weren't being played at that time?
Phillip LeMarque: I think they were. I'm not recalling exactly, but it was very noisy.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah. Everything was noisy there.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you said you almost dropped the french fries. What happened next?
Phillip LeMarque: Then I backed out, and --
Mr. Auchincloss: Backed out the door?
Phillip LeMarque: The door. Went outside, and I closed the door. And I realized that I still had to deliver the french fries, so then I opened the door. I made a lot of noise to make sure that Michael could hear me coming in. And I said, “Michael, your french fries are here”. And he said, “Drop them on this”. I forgot where it was, but probably on one of the machine tops.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you leave?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: May I have the Elmo, Your Honor? “Input 4”.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Mr. LeMarque, I'm showing you People's Exhibit No. 800, which you previously identified as a photograph of the arcade. Does this photograph depict in it anywhere the door that you entered that room?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah. Yes. This one here.
Mr. Auchincloss: Oh, you've got it. Very good. You're ahead of me. Could you indicate again for me the area where it is?
Phillip LeMarque: I think it's around here somewhere. Or here, I'm sorry. I don't know. Can't see too well, that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Let me show you the photograph -- if I may approach -- just so you can get a better look at it.
Phillip LeMarque: I don't know. I think it's -- there's a lot of stuff in front of it. It's probably -- I'm not sure where it is. It's probably here.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: Right about there?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. I'll show it.... Looking at the photograph a little closer, could you identify the area that appears to be the doorway?
Phillip LeMarque: Right here.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Indicating in the very upper portion of the photograph just off center at the upper edge. All right. So that's the door you entered in. And which direction was it that you were looking when you came in and you saw Mr. Jackson?
Phillip LeMarque: From here to here.
Mr. Auchincloss: Indicating from the left area of where the door is down to the --
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- lower right-hand portion of the photograph?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah. Here to here. Or here to here someplace.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. I show you now People's Exhibit No. 801. Mr. LeMarque, does that show a different perspective --
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- of the same area?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is that an approximate perspective of what you would have seen entering that door?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. So tell us, point out for us, if you would, the area where you saw Mr. Jackson and Macaulay Culkin.
Phillip LeMarque: Somewhere around there.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Phillip LeMarque: Or maybe --
Mr. Auchincloss: Indicating --
Phillip LeMarque: Or maybe here.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- the video games just to the left of what appears to be an espresso machine.
Phillip LeMarque: This was not there.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yeah, the espresso machine was not there --
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- on the pool table?
Phillip LeMarque: No. Either this. This wasn't there.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: I think we can have the lights.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. LeMarque, did you ever tell this story -- or let me back up. After you left Neverland, or at any time during close in time to the period that you saw these events, this event you just described, did you ever report it to any authorities, the police?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why not?
Phillip LeMarque: Because nobody would have ever believed us.
Mr. Auchincloss: And why do you say that?
Phillip LeMarque: Because Michael was on the top of everything, and if we had come and said to the police, they would have said, “What kind of proof do you have?” So we couldn't -- I mean, this wasn't possible. It would be impossible to give.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever consult an attorney or any other person that might have some background in the law as to what you should do?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes, and they told us the same thing.
Mr. Auchincloss: At some time after this event occurred, did -- were you ever approached by any tabloids?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes. Many.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you ever sell this story to a tabloid?
Phillip LeMarque: We talked about it. And we had even some guy trying to sell the story for us, some sleazy guy that tried to make a deal with the tabloid. But at the last minute, we never took in a penny from anyone, because it was against our principles.
Mr. Auchincloss: This sleazy guy that you're talking about, I'm not going to ask you to mention his name, but do you know if he ever profited from your story?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes, he did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why do you say that?
Phillip LeMarque: Because we had an interview with him and our lawyer, Arnold Kessler, and he taped the conversation while it was a private conversation of the lawyer.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Phillip LeMarque: And he sold the story to the tabloid and he made some money with that story.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you tempted yourself to sell your story to the tabloid?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes, we were tempted for the money, for sure. Everybody would be tempted. But we never did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ultimately tell this story to the police?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes, we did.
Mr. Auchincloss: They came and interviewed you?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you honest with them?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you. I have no further questions.
The Court: Cross-examine?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please, Your Honor.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. LeMarque, my name is Tom Mesereau and I speak for Mr. Jackson. You signed a statement in September of 1993 about what you had seen, right?
Phillip LeMarque: If I signed a statement, I forgot when was that, if I sign a statement.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember hand-writing a statement about what you claimed you had seen --
Phillip LeMarque: I don't remember that.
Mr. Mesereau: -- Mr. Jackson doing with Mr. Culkin? Remember saying, “I could not distinguish what he was really doing with his hand”, but you thought it was more than fondling?
Phillip LeMarque: I don't remember that at all.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you a copy of the statement?
Phillip LeMarque: (Nods head up and down.)
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Phillip LeMarque: I guess it's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that your handwriting?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that your signature?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: The date is September 10th, 1993, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember saying you couldn't distinguish what he was really doing with his hand?
Phillip LeMarque: I don't recall that. But if it's written, that's --
Mr. Mesereau: It's what you wrote, isn't it?
Phillip LeMarque: I guess.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, is it your writing or not?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes, it is.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you wrote those words, did you not?
Phillip LeMarque: I guess I did, but I don't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you worked at the Neverland Ranch for how long?
Phillip LeMarque: Maybe ten months.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever sue Mr. Jackson?
Phillip LeMarque: No. Not for -- we did sue for money he owed us, because Norma Stakos was supposed to pay us overtime, and she never did. And she was supposed to give us some references, good references for other job, and whenever we apply for a job, she never give the references and she never sent us the money. So at that time we sued for the money that was owed to us as overtime.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me, I'm sorry. Did you finish?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did you file your lawsuit against Mr. Jackson?
Phillip LeMarque: Santa Barbara court, I think.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you hire a lawyer in Santa Barbara to do that?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What was the lawyer's name?
Phillip LeMarque: Forgot.
Mr. Mesereau: How long did the lawsuit go on?
Phillip LeMarque: It didn't go on for very long.
Mr. Mesereau: It settled fairly quickly, did it not?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You got money --
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: -- from Mr. Jackson, true?
Phillip LeMarque: We got money for time -- overtime due to us, the time we worked there.
Mr. Mesereau: You wanted more than that, didn't you?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you mentioned a sleazy guy was representing you, right?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: His name was?
Phillip LeMarque: He didn't represent us. He never represented us.
Mr. Mesereau: You had meetings with him?
Phillip LeMarque: He was a friend, supposedly a friend.
Mr. Mesereau: You had meetings with him, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes, we did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; argumentative.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: His name was Paul Baressi, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you meet Paul Baressi?
Phillip LeMarque: It was an old friend that Stella met years ago.
Mr. Mesereau: And Stella is who?
Phillip LeMarque: My wife.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know how she met Paul Baressi?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times did you meet with Paul Baressi?
Phillip LeMarque: I can't recall. Several times.
Mr. Mesereau: And Paul Baressi was in the adult film business, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: The Court's order.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You said he was sleazy. Why did you say that to the jury?
Phillip LeMarque: Because he taped our conversation without our own knowledge while we had a conversation with our own private lawyer, and he sold that story to the tabloid.
Mr. Mesereau: He was also trying to broker a deal for you with the tabloids, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, that's what he said. “I can get you a deal”, because he had a deal himself previously by telling stories about other people.
Mr. Mesereau: But you had asked him to try and get a deal for you, hadn't you?
Phillip LeMarque: No, I didn't ask him. He came forwards.
Mr. Mesereau: But you allowed him to do that, didn't you?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, we didn't allow him. We said, “Okay, we'll listen to it”, because we were tempted by the money, for sure. Everybody would be tempted. But in the last minute, we didn't do it.
Mr. Mesereau: When -- excuse me. You didn't do it because you found out he had already sold the story and taken the money himself, right?
Phillip LeMarque: At that time he didn't do that. He didn't sell the story yet.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me just get this straight. You had discussions with Baressi, right?
Phillip LeMarque: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: You had phone conversations with Baressi, right?
Phillip LeMarque: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You discussed a price you'd be willing to accept?
Phillip LeMarque: No, we didn't discuss price with him.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me?
Phillip LeMarque: We didn't discuss price with him.
Mr. Mesereau: At one point you discussed the possibility of getting $100,000 with him, didn't you?
Phillip LeMarque: That's what he said to us, he probably can get $100,000, so we say we are interested.
Mr. Mesereau: You actually upped it to 500, didn't you?
Phillip LeMarque: I don't remember if that was the case, but we were playing the game with him to see how far he could go, because we knew by then he was such a sleazy guy we wanted to see how far he could go. Because we never did it. We never took a penny from anyone.
Mr. Mesereau: You upped the price to 500 from $100,000 at one point?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah, to see if we were going to do it.
Mr. Mesereau: You couldn't get that kind of money, right?
Phillip LeMarque: I don't know. We never pursued it.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Baressi, on your behalf, approached a number of newspapers --
Phillip LeMarque: He didn't work on our behalf, ever.
Mr. Mesereau: Sir, I have to finish my question. On your behalf, Paul Baressi approached various newspapers and television shows to try and get hundreds of thousands of dollars for you and your wife, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; assumes facts not in evidence.
Phillip LeMarque: That's not true.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Mesereau: Isn't that right?
Phillip LeMarque: That's not true. It's a complete lie. He was trying to get deals for him, not for us.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you just tell the jury you were playing along with him to see how much you could get?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, at first, yeah, we were doing. But then we realized the guy was so sleazy, we were not going anywhere with him. So we backed out, and we said, “We are not game”, and he kept going, doing it.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have a discussion with Paul Baressi where you said, “We don't want 100,000. We want 500,000”? Yes or no.
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember having a discussion with Mr. Baressi where you learned the price would be higher if the story was Mr. Jackson's hand was in the clothes rather than outside?
Phillip LeMarque: That was his own made-up stories, not my story.
Mr. Mesereau: That statement was made in your discussion with Mr. Baressi, true?
Phillip LeMarque: I don't recall that, but I think he did it himself. That's what he said we could get if the hands went higher.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, did you ever know anyone named Quindoy at Neverland?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; beyond the scope.
Mr. Mesereau: It fits in with the cross-examination, Your Honor.
The Court: That's a good response. (Laughter.)
Mr. Mesereau: I mean, it's the same --
The Court: “Fits in with what I'm doing”. Well, I don't know the answer. I'll allow the question and see how it fits.
Mr. Mesereau: You and your wife worked at Neverland, right?
Phillip LeMarque: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever know a couple named Quindoy that worked at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever hear the name?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Had they worked before you?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You learned that the Quindoys were trying to sell a story to the media, right?
Phillip LeMarque: No, we never --
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Relevance; beyond the scope.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer. He did answer. The answer was, “Yes”, and then -- I'm sorry, the answer was, “No, we never”.
Mr. Mesereau: At one point you were trying to sell your story before the Quindoys did, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never talked about that with Mr. Baressi?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Who was the lawyer you retained when it came to dealing with the media?
Phillip LeMarque: We had a friend, his name was Arnold -- geez. I'm sorry, I have a blank right now. I have a blank with the name.
Mr. Mesereau: Was his name Kessler?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes. That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he practice law in Los Angeles?
Phillip LeMarque: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you meet with Mr. Kessler?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes, we did.
Mr. Mesereau: He is not the lawyer that represented you in your suit against Mr. Jackson, is he?
Phillip LeMarque: We didn't have a suit against Mr. Jackson. We had a suit against the work, as far as work was concerned. We never sued Mr. Michael Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: You sued somebody.
Phillip LeMarque: We sued the MJ Corporation for overtime.
Mr. Mesereau: That was Mr. Jackson's company.
Phillip LeMarque: That's the company, but that's not Mr. Jackson. We didn't sue him.
Mr. Mesereau: It was Mr. Jackson's company that hired you, wasn't it?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes. For overtime.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. This was after you left your employment, true?
Phillip LeMarque: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You hired Attorney Kessler, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: No, we didn't hire him. He was a friend of ours. We ask him advice.
Mr. Mesereau: You met with him a number of times about the possibility of selling a story to the media, true?
Phillip LeMarque: With Baressi.
Mr. Mesereau: So Baressi was your friend, and Kessler was your friend, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And after you met with Kessler, he started calling around trying to sell your story, true?
Phillip LeMarque: I'm not sure what he was doing. I don't know. I never heard of it.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn that he was doing anything to sell your story to anybody?
Phillip LeMarque: I was -- I don't recall, but I think everybody was trying to sell our stories. Everybody else was trying to do that, so --
Mr. Mesereau: And approximately what year was this?
Phillip LeMarque: I don't recall. '92 or something. I --
Mr. Mesereau: When did you leave Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: The year? I don't recall. '92, probably, at that time. Whatever. I'm not sure.
Mr. Mesereau: In 1993, Baressi and Kessler were trying to sell your story, true?
Phillip LeMarque: I guess they were, but I was not aware of it.
Mr. Mesereau: But you had many talks with the two of them about that?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah, we did earlier. And then we stopped and they kept doing it. I don't know what they were doing. I couldn't keep track of them.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When did you last talk to Kessler?
Phillip LeMarque: About that time. No, as a matter of fact, I talked to him two days ago because of what happened in the -- with what was going on, and I finally find his phone number, and I told him what was going on. And he was very upset about it.
Mr. Mesereau: He's still your buddy, right?
Phillip LeMarque: No, we haven't talked since then.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you talk to him about what you were going to say in court today?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you talk to him about this case?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah, I said I was going to be on the stand.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you call him or did he call you?
Phillip LeMarque: We called him.
Mr. Mesereau: You and your wife?
Phillip LeMarque: My wife did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Were you on the conversation?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it just your wife that talked to him, as far as you know?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Was she speaking on your behalf?
Phillip LeMarque: She was just telling him what was going on, that's all.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Phillip LeMarque: There was no behalf. There was just chat-chat.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew that Mr. Kessler contacted The National Enquirer about your story, right?
Phillip LeMarque: No, I was not aware of that.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew he contacted The Globe, right?
Phillip LeMarque: I was not aware of that either. We contacted them.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew Inside Edition was contacted, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, they contacted us directly also. So --
Mr. Mesereau: How about Splash News Service?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When did you last see Macaulay Culkin?
Phillip LeMarque: At that time. When I was working at the ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: So you've never really asked him if he was abused, have you?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You've never heard his side, have you?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever learned any time that he denies this event?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; assumes facts.
Phillip LeMarque: I --
The Court: Just a moment.
Mr. Auchincloss: He said he's never had any conversation. And foundation. He said he's had no conversation with Mr. Macaulay.
The Court: The objection is sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Have you followed this case in the media?
Phillip LeMarque: I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't follow it at all?
Phillip LeMarque: I never watch T.V., barely.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you followed this case in the newspaper?
Phillip LeMarque: I read the newspaper briefly, the highlights, the headlines and so on. But it doesn't interest me.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you last talk to Mr. Baressi?
Phillip LeMarque: He called my wife two months ago.
Mr. Mesereau: Did your wife talk to him?
Phillip LeMarque: She said, “Go to hell”.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm not asking you what she said. (Laughter.)
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Okay. Do you know -- are you aware of him still trying to sell stories on this case?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah, he's still doing it.
Mr. Mesereau: How do you know he's still doing it?
Phillip LeMarque: Because it's on the --
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Foundation; hearsay.
The Court: The objection is overruled. The question was, “How do you know he's still doing it?”
Phillip LeMarque: Pardon me?
The Court: You may answer that question. How do you --
Phillip LeMarque: I'm sorry, can you repeat that?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. I'll ask the question again. You told the jury Mr. Baressi is still trying to sell stories, right?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How do you know that?
Phillip LeMarque: My son send me a copy through the Internet two days ago of what was in Splash.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled. Next question.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you met with any prosecutor to talk about your testimony today, before today?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Who did you meet with?
Phillip LeMarque: The prosecutor right here.
Mr. Mesereau: And is that Mr. Auchincloss?
Phillip LeMarque: Uh-huh. That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you meet with him?
Phillip LeMarque: When?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Phillip LeMarque: This morning.
Mr. Mesereau: And where did you meet?
Phillip LeMarque: We meet in the witness room.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he show you any documents?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What documents did he show you?
Phillip LeMarque: The documents that was shown here on the screen.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, are you aware of an article appearing in The Globe newspaper on September 21st, 1993, that quotes you?
Phillip LeMarque: No. I never saw it.
Mr. Mesereau: Never heard about it?
Phillip LeMarque: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you aware of that article quoting your wife?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you never heard about that or looked at it, right?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. No one ever told you about it, right?
Phillip LeMarque: No. My friends don't read that kind of newspapers.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. Before you took the stand today, had you ever heard that you were quoted in an article about Michael Jackson in The Globe newspaper?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times have you been interviewed by anyone with the sheriff's department on this case?
Phillip LeMarque: Just one time in '93 or something.
Mr. Mesereau: Just one time?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had many phone conversations with anybody from the sheriff's department about the case?
Phillip LeMarque: No, not that I recall.
Mr. Mesereau: Has anyone ever called you on the phone from the prosecution to talk about the case?
Phillip LeMarque: No. Just to tell us that we are going to be in court. That's all.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, when did you last talk to Norma Stakos?
Phillip LeMarque: The last day that we left the ranch, Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you sue her as well?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You just sued Mr. Jackson's company, right?
Phillip LeMarque: We sued Michael just for the overtime that we -- were owed to us.
Mr. Mesereau: That's over a seven-month period?
Phillip LeMarque: Seven months what? I'm sorry, after -- after we left in --
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Phillip LeMarque: I guess. I don't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you say you hadn't been ever paid for overtime while working at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And was that over a seven-month period or nine-month period? I can't remember.
Phillip LeMarque: Nine, ten, something like that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Had you ever made a claim for overtime while you were working?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes, we did. We settled with Norma at the time we left. She said she was going to give us money for the overtime and give us good references. And we sued when she didn't fill up the part that she said she was going to do.
Mr. Mesereau: You felt she was obligated to give you and your wife a good reference for another job?
Phillip LeMarque: Why not?
Mr. Mesereau: What if she didn't think you were competent?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; relevance.
Phillip LeMarque: She said she would do it. She said she was going to give us a good reference.
The Court: Just a moment. Just a moment. The objection is sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You felt that part of your agreement with Mr. Jackson's company was that if they were contacted by anyone and asked if you were someone you should work with, they had to give you a good recommendation; is that correct?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And you never called the police about what you claim Mr. Jackson did to Mr. Culkin, right?
Phillip LeMarque: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you indicated you were asked to sign a document saying that a woman named Bianca looked inside someone's purse, right?
Phillip LeMarque: That's correct. I was not, myself. My wife was.
Mr. Mesereau: That's Blanca Francia, right?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know her when she worked at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was she a friend of yours?
Phillip LeMarque: We didn't have any friends. We couldn't have any friends at the ranch. It was forbidden to be friends with the help. Because everybody was spying on each other, so there was no way to be friends with anyone.
Mr. Mesereau: The spying was because people were looking for stories to sell, right?
Phillip LeMarque: No, because I think that's --
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; argumentative.
Phillip LeMarque: That's not true.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll withdraw the objection. (Laughter.)
Mr. Mesereau: Are you saying it's your wife that saw Blanca Francia go into someone's purse?
Phillip LeMarque: She didn't see her doing it. That's why she didn't want to sign it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever talk to Blanca Francia about whether or not she did put her hand in someone's purse?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
Phillip LeMarque: I never did myself.
The Court: I couldn't hear your objection, Counsel.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll withdraw it.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever ask Blanca Francia if she ever did, in fact, go into someone's purse?
Phillip LeMarque: No, I never ask myself personally.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn that she had admitted doing it?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Argumentative; assumes facts.
The Court: It's overruled. You may answer.
Phillip LeMarque: I'm sorry. Say that again, please.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll withdraw the question and reask it.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn that Blanca Francia admitted she had gone into someone's purse?
Phillip LeMarque: I never heard of anything like this, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. What hours did you work at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: There was no set hours. It was whenever Michael was in residence or whenever guests were present.
Mr. Mesereau: And where did you live when you were working at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: At the ranch. I mean, at the Neverland itself, in a private house.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you told the jury that you went to a lawyer and told the lawyer about what you claim you saw in the arcade, right?
Phillip LeMarque: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that while you were working at Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: After we left.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't go to a lawyer right away to discuss what you had seen, did you?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know what this particular lawyer specializes in?
Phillip LeMarque: General practice.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me?
Phillip LeMarque: General practice.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Had he represented you before?
Phillip LeMarque: No. He was just a friend.
Mr. Mesereau: Had he given advice to you before?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: How many meetings did you have with this lawyer about what you claim you saw in the arcade?
Phillip LeMarque: I think only one time.
Mr. Mesereau: You had phone conversations with him, did you not?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You had phone conversations about the possibility of selling a story, correct?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Cumulative; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Approximately when do you claim you saw Mr. Jackson with Mr. Culkin in the arcade?
Phillip LeMarque: The time?
Mr. Mesereau: Approximately, yes.
Phillip LeMarque: Maybe three o'clock, 3:00 a.m.
Mr. Mesereau: No, let me rephrase it. It's my mistake. Approximately what month and year do you claim you saw this happen?
Phillip LeMarque: I don't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: You continued to work at Neverland after you saw what you claim you saw, right?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was your wife working at Neverland as well?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You never reported this to anyone there obviously, right?
Phillip LeMarque: No, we didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: You never went to Miss Stakos and said, “I saw something improper going on”, right?
Phillip LeMarque: We didn't have to do that. She knew about it.
Mr. Mesereau: So she was with you watching it?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You said that Mr. Baressi tape-recorded you, right?
Phillip LeMarque: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know how many times he did that?
Phillip LeMarque: I have no idea.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever inquire as to how many times you had been secretly tape-recorded by him?
Phillip LeMarque: No, I didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever ask him?
Phillip LeMarque: I didn't even know he did it until a few days ago.
Mr. Mesereau: Who told you he did it?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, we heard about it from the news and all that, and this information came out, and so that's how we find out.
Mr. Mesereau: I thought you didn't follow the news about the case.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you have any idea how many times you've been quoted in any tabloid about Michael Jackson?
Phillip LeMarque: I have no idea.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; relevance.
The Court: The answer was, “I have no idea”. I'll allow the question.
Mr. Mesereau: Would you agree that with time, your story about what you say Mr. Jackson did has changed?
Phillip LeMarque: I don't think so.
Mr. Mesereau: When you wrote that handwritten statement that I showed you which had your signature and handwriting, were you being truthful?
Phillip LeMarque: I don't recall writing this at all, so I have no recollection of that.
Mr. Mesereau: But you did admit that is your handwriting and signature, true?
Phillip LeMarque: Looks like my handwriting.
Mr. Mesereau: Is it your signature?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Isn't it true, Mr. LeMarque, that in 1993, you waited till you were out of personal bankruptcy to start selling the story?
Phillip LeMarque: My personal bankruptcy was about 18, 19, 20 years ago. Had nothing to do with this.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have any bankruptcy proceeding going on in the 1990s, sir?
Phillip LeMarque: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Never filed a document in that regard, right?
Phillip LeMarque: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never were involved in a Chapter 7 action?
Phillip LeMarque: I was. Twenty years ago.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm going to object as improper impeachment.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: I have no further questions, Your Honor.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:
Mr. Auchincloss: Just a few questions, Mr. LeMarque. The action that you had against Mr. Jackson for overtime when you left Neverland, did Norma Stakos promise to pay you for your past overtime?
Phillip LeMarque: She did.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you left Neverland, did she promise to make good references for you in the future?
Phillip LeMarque: She did.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you left Neverland, did you ever receive the overtime payment that you were due?
Phillip LeMarque: She never did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you go to the California Labor Board to dispute that?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes. That's where we went.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have to litigate it?
Phillip LeMarque: No, she settled right away.
Mr. Auchincloss: MJJ Productions settled right away?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you get what you felt you were entitled to?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes. We had the proof that we had worked overtime, so I had account of all the time we work, so --
Mr. Auchincloss: And as far as Mr. Kessler, was he working for you? Did you ever have to pay him for helping you with this tabloid business?
Phillip LeMarque: He was a friend. We just asked advice, that's all.
Mr. Auchincloss: So he was just working as a lawyer friend for you?
Phillip LeMarque: He was -- yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. I'm showing you People's Exhibit No. 802. Appears to be a copy of the handwritten note. Is that the note that counsel showed you a few moments ago?
Phillip LeMarque: Looks the same.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. I'd like you to read that over carefully. Take a moment. Just one page.
Phillip LeMarque: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay? Does that represent a fair summation of the facts that you observed in the arcade during that period of time when you observed Macaulay Culkin and the defendant?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah, that's basically what I saw.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. I'd ask to move 802 into evidence at this time, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: No objection.
The Court: It's admitted.
Mr. Auchincloss: And in that account, do you tell -- do you depict that Mr. Jackson's hand is in Mr. Culkin's shorts?
Phillip LeMarque: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you. I have no further questions.
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: If you would -- Does he have the document?
Mr. Auchincloss: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: If you would, please take a look at that document and read it to yourself.
Phillip LeMarque: I did already.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Okay. Now, you made two statements: One on September 10th, 1993, and one on what looks to be -- well, I guess that would be -- you make a second statement in the form of a P.S., right? Is that made the same day; do you know?
Phillip LeMarque: Looks the same.
Mr. Mesereau: You first -- there's a signature in the middle of the page. It says, “Phillip LeMarque, September 10th, 1993”, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: There's another signature towards the bottom of the page that says, “Phillip LeMarque, 9-10-93”, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: You first wrote a statement about what you saw and then you added a P.S., correct?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Let's look at the statement that appears at the beginning, okay? You say that Mr. Jackson had his left hand in the kid's pants, right?
Phillip LeMarque: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You say, “I couldn't distinguish what he was really doing with his hand, but obviously it was more than fondling”, right?
Phillip LeMarque: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: You then signed and dated that, true?
Phillip LeMarque: Correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm going to object if he's just reading part of the statement. I'd ask that the entire statement be read before the signature line.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: You said up top the child was not disturbed by the action, right?
Phillip LeMarque: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You said they were playing a game, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You said the kid was very involved with the game, right?
Phillip LeMarque: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You said that Michael Jackson was holding Macaulay while he was playing the game, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: After you signed and dated that statement, you then chose to add something else, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And what you add was that “His left hand was in his pants under the shorts, left leg, all the way to the crotch”, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You added that to what you had said earlier after you had signed your name to what you had said earlier, true?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And when was this thing actually -- when was this statement actually done; do you know?
Phillip LeMarque: At the same time. It was just an addendum. Clarification.
Mr. Mesereau: Why did you want an addendum to what you had already written down and signed?
Phillip LeMarque: I forgot at the time why I did it. I don't have any other recollection of that anyway.
Mr. Mesereau: You did it because you wanted to sell a story, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; argumentative.
Phillip LeMarque: Absolutely false.
Mr. Mesereau: I have no further questions.
The Court: Do you want to withdraw your objection, or --
Mr. Auchincloss: I think so. Sure, why not?
Message: FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:
Mr. Auchincloss: Was this document prepared for the police?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. And was it prepared after the police interviewed you?
Phillip LeMarque: Well, it was prepared. I forgot exactly when, if it was at the same time or after. I have no recollection.
Mr. Auchincloss: But the police asked you to write out a statement?
Phillip LeMarque: A statement of what I saw.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Do you recall if they asked you to put in the details, some more details as far as what you had told them?
Phillip LeMarque: As much as possible, yes. They wanted more details.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is that why the P.S. was added; do you know?
Phillip LeMarque: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Thank you. Nothing further.
Message: FURTHER RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Obviously this statement was written out after you talked to Mr. Baressi, true?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; vague.
Phillip LeMarque: I don't think so.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll object as a vague question as far as time.
Phillip LeMarque: I don't think so. I'm not sure.
The Court: Just a moment. You have to wait until I rule. Overruled. Now, read the question back to him.
Mr. Mesereau: The statement was written --
The Court: No, the court reporter.
The Court Reporter: Obviously this statement was written out after you talked to Mr. Baressi, true?
Phillip LeMarque: It's probably after, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember I asked you earlier about that statement, and you told the jury you didn't recall?
Phillip LeMarque: I have no recollection exactly, that's for sure. But now it's coming back, you know.
Mr. Mesereau: It's coming back when the prosecutor suggested you wrote it for the police, correct?
Phillip LeMarque: No, it's coming back --
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; argumentative. Objection; argumentative.
The Court: All right. Just a moment. You need to wait until the question is completed before you answer.
Phillip LeMarque: Okay.
The Court: And just hold on a second so if someone wants to object, they can. And counsel needs to not step on his statements. The court reporter is struggling to keep the record straight. All right. There actually is -- the objection was made after he answered, so I'm going to overrule that objection. You may ask your next question.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You now recall that you wrote the statement in September of 1993 in a police interview, right?
Phillip LeMarque: I'm starting to recall. See, I'm 70 years old this year, and my memory is faltering.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I understand. Have you now fully recollected that you wrote this for the police?
Phillip LeMarque: It's coming back a little bit, and I think that, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you sure?
Phillip LeMarque: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Isn't it true you wrote out the statement, you dated and signed it, and somebody wanted you to add something else, so you put in an addendum, and then signed and dated that the same day, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Phillip LeMarque: I don't recall very well when I made this statement, when I wrote it, and I don't recall why there was an addendum added to the statement.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And the statement was written approximately how long after you left Neverland?
Phillip LeMarque: Whenever the police came, which might be a year after or two years. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, the statement says September 10th, 1993 --
Phillip LeMarque: Okay. So --
Mr. Mesereau: -- right? And how long -- how much time had elapsed between your leaving Neverland and September 10th, 1993, if you know?
Phillip LeMarque: Probably a year. A little more than a year.
Mr. Mesereau: And how much time had elapsed between when you saw what you claim you saw in the arcade and September 10th, '93?
Phillip LeMarque: 14 months. 12, 14 months.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions.
Mr. Auchincloss: Nothing further.
The Court: All right. Thank you. You may step down. Call your next witness.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, because of some of the Court's rulings this morning, we have no further witnesses at this time.
The Court: Are you trying to tell the jury they have to go home early today?
Mr. Sneddon: Unfortunately, I am, Your Honor. I apologize for that from the bottom of my heart.
The Court: That's the bad news. (Laughter.)
The Court: You know, I have some photographs of the wildflowers that I took. (Laughter.)
The Court: All right. I can tell you're not interested. We'll release you early today. It's -- I think it's been a pretty intense week. It doesn't hurt to get a little time off here. Let me just remind you of the seriousness of your conduct and the admonitions that I've made. The admonitions are that you can't talk to anybody about this case, including each other, your family members, or anybody. You certainly can't go to anyplace where the events that you hear about testified to occurred or are alleged to have occurred. You are not to listen to or read news accounts or watch T.V. concerning the case. And, you know, I don't think I should need to remind you of this, but I will, just so that I have a clean conscience. Everybody is watching you, you know. Your behavior, just as my own behavior, is under scrutiny, just as these attorneys' behavior. Everything that happens is reported one way or another. So please be very serious about the responsibility that you've been given here. And having that in mind, I would like you to go out and look at the wildflowers. (Laughter.)
The Court: Thank you. And I'm going to stay with the attorneys. There's a couple of issues that we need to take up, but you're free to go. See you Monday at 8:30. And remember, Tuesday afternoon you'll be off, too.
Message: The following proceedings were held in open court outside the presence and hearing of the jury:
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, can Mr. Jackson depart, or is he --
The Court: Listen, the audience may leave if they want to. The Court is going to take up a couple of motions that have been pending. But anyone in the audience that would like to leave at this time, feel free to do that. Mr. Jackson, if you would like to leave at this time, you may do so.
The Defendant: Thank you.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
The Defendant: Thank you.
The Court: All right. During the last week or so, there have been some motions that have been pending. We have -- the first one is defendant's motion for a mistrial, or, in the alternative, restrictive instructions. I've read and considered the points and authorities. Do you wish to be heard?
Mr. Sanger: Just briefly, Your Honor.
The Court: Now, just because you haven't said anything all week -- go ahead. I know it's just been building up and --
Mr. Sanger: I'll try to behave myself, Your Honor.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sanger: The serious matter is, and we did brief it, but it was very brief, because it was an overnight, sort of a pocket thing.
The Court: Very good brief.
Mr. Sanger: The briefer the better, I gather. The point being, though, that the lawyers have to exercise control over the witnesses. They have to admonish the witnesses properly. It is true a witness can do something contrary to the admonitions. This just happened to be a series of witnesses who all seemed to have done the same thing with each other, which is call each other either before or after their testimony. And there were two particularly egregious instances of witnesses calling immediately after their testimony was over to discuss their testimony with the upcoming witness, and that was Miss Palanker calling Mr. Masada, and then Dr. Katz calling Mr. Feldman. And that seemed to be such an egregious breach -- there had already been notice of this with the witnesses talking to each other, Dickerman and Katz, and -- I'm sorry, Palanker and Masada, and by the time we got to Dr. Katz calling Mr. Feldman, it seem to me that that was just too much. And anybody who's managing these witnesses and preparing them to come in here should have had a very large shot fired over their bow by virtue of this conduct and should have admonished their witnesses. So I feel that it does taint their testimony when you have two people who are critical witnesses, according to the prosecution, like Dr. Katz and Mr. Feldman, for instance, who are talking about testimony that very seriously impairs the integrity of the process that the Court is trying to preserve. And therefore, we feel that a mistrial is the only appropriate remedy. How can the jury otherwise consider this evidence as it should have been presented without being tainted by other witnesses? If the Court were to deny that, then we did propose a curative instruction, and we would ask the Court to take that action at the very least. Thank you.
The Court: Who's speaking on behalf of the D.A.?
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, we filed a response in written form, and I don't intend to go through it. It's in there. And I'll simply point out that unfortunately if Mr. Sanger -- there is nothing in this record that shows that they were talking about their testimony in this case. And particularly in the case of Mrs. Palanker talking to Jamie Masada, it wasn't the subject of the testimony that was the subject of the conversation. It was the subject of the behavior of the lawyer that was cross-examining her. And I'd submit to the Court there is nothing improper about what these witnesses have done, nor showing that they discussed their testimony. Some of the conversations, the one involved a request from one lawyer to the other as to knowledge of whether or not there had been an attorney-client waiver and that was post-testimonial. It was an after-the-fact. And it seems to me that certainly one lawyer has a right, when they're both involved in a case, to find out whether there was a waiver or not. I'll submit it on the basis of the other information that we provided to the Court from the transcripts and the authorities.
The Court: The motion for mistrial is denied. The record is clear that there has been some conversation between witnesses. And I've asked counsel, both sides, to admonish their witnesses that -- before and after their testimony, unless they're excused, that they are not to discuss -- well, what I've admonished is that they are bound by the protective order before their testimony and after, unless they're excused. I don't -- in looking at the record, I don't see evidence that they violated the protective order. That exists -- the lack of that evidence is that neither side pursued it with any detail as to what the discussions were. But I don't think that would prevent the defense from commenting in their argument, if they wanted to, about the fact that they had been discussing their testimony with each other. And whether or not I'll give a special instruction on that I'll put off until we decide all of our instructions. I'm not leaning in the direction of giving a special instruction in view of the lack of evidence that there was specific conversations about their testimony, but I also am not willing to say I won't give that, and we still have a long way to go in this trial and a lot of witnesses in front of us. So I'll take that issue up on a discussion, Mr. Sanger, on the -- on whatever -- you may submit the same or different instructions when you submit your final instructions. And that will be my ruling on that. The next item would be the D.A.'s request for mandatory judicial notice of statutes.
Mr. Auchincloss: There's a discussion as to whether or not counsel is prepared on this.
Mr. Sanger: Hold on. You don't need to -- unless we're addressing the Court, we don't need to have that....
The Court: You know, I can just cut this short.
Mr. Auchincloss: That's fine.
The Court: I don't think I'm going to give any instruction on this at this time. Whether or not I'll give it in the final group of instructions will depend on our discussions at that time.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. I guess our request is just based upon the fact that there has been numerous questions asked and numerous answers given concerning these areas of the law, and I do think it's important that the jury does ultimately understand the letter of the law, particularly with regard to the recording, the surreptitious recording of conversations, and that it is legal for police officers to surreptitiously record conversations. So I don't mind addressing that when we get into instructions, but we will be making that same motion at that time.
The Court: You may submit those. I don't think it's a time to give special instructions on that. I do give some instructions as we go along. I don't think these are ones that I would give at this time. And Mr. Sanger, that's, I assume, satisfactory with you?
Mr. Sanger: Yes, Your Honor.
The Court: The motion to prohibit testimony of 1108 witnesses for failure to comply with Penal Code Section 1054.7, do you wish to address that?
Mr. Sanger: Well, I think the Court is taking this up now one at a time.
The Court: I am.
Mr. Sanger: And so as long as the Court is cognizant of that, I don't think we need a ruling right now. But we are confronted with a number of witnesses for whom we have not received reports until the very last second, and it's causing a problem. It's caused a problem today.
The Court: All right. The next one is the objection to admission of 1108 and 1101 evidence. And I feel that was adequately argued back when we were arguing about whether or not I would allow the 1108 and 1101 evidence, and I don't see that any new issues have been raised there, so I'll deny that objection. It's made a matter of the record, which is what I think you intended there. In my counting of all the things that were pending that are still out there, that would only leave one thing that's still out there that hasn't been dealt with, which was the supplemental declaration that I'd asked for from Miss Yu, which she provided me with, I'm sure she provided you with. This is a matter of statutorily sealed declarations. And I still have -- I'm still dealing with that. I'm not prepared to hear anything further on it. And I'm not prepared to make any rulings on it. That's not something I've had time to deal with, but I just wanted everyone to know that I know that's still out there. And then I was going to ask you if there is anything else that I don't have on my list.
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, the only thing that I have -- well, the only thing I have is if I could ask the Court, do we have some kind of an update with regard to the computers, the Brad Miller computer and the Evvy Tavasci computer? And I say that to the Court because I'm estimating that we're getting -- not close, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel with regard to us resting our case, and we'd certainly like to have access to that information before we do.
The Court: December or January, something like that?
Mr. Sneddon: I think the light's a little bit brighter than that, Judge.
The Court: Okay. I wish -- you know, the person who's been helping me with that has been Jed, and he doesn't -- I have not been updated, so I can't update you. Does counsel have any information?
Mr. Sanger: The information that we have is that as of, I would say, weeks ago, if not a month ago - that's off the top of my head - but I believe we provided everything we were requested to provide maybe two months ago. And I think what happened next is he was making additional inquiries based on the particular narrowing of the request by the District Attorney, but I have not heard anything further.
The Court: Do you know what --
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, I have a little different recollection.
The Court: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: It's not different, it's just maybe updated. As I recall the last time that we talked, they had actually done the -- Mr. Roden had actually gone through, I believe it was - I may be confused about this - one of them. He had gone through and actually sorted out what the various types that he thought may or may not be privileged and that those were going to be submitted to the Court. And that he was in the process of doing that to the other computer. I don't really need an update today, but if maybe on Monday we could have Mr. Beebe here and get an update with regard to where we stand on that process, that would be helpful, probably, to both sides.
The Court: We'll do that.
Mr. Sneddon: That would be fine with me. I just wanted to keep it on the radar screen for you, Your Honor.
The Court: I'll ask him about that today, and no later than Monday we'll address it.
Mr. Sneddon: Thank you.
The Court: All right. Yes?
Mr. Zonen: The Court has four different SDT returns in the Court's possession from Talk America, from Varig Airlines, from Von's, and from Santa Ynez High School. I've consulted with Mr. Mesereau and Mr. Sanger. We are going to agree that those materials turned over to the Court in obedience with those subpoenas can be turned over to the District Attorney's Office. And we will make copies for both of us and immediately return it to the Court.
The Court: Is that your agreement?
Mr. Sanger: Yes, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. I'll approve that agreement, and you may collect those items.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you very much.
The Court: Thank you. All right. Then anything else?
Mr. Oxman: Your Honor, there's also some SDT returns from the defense.
The Bailiff: Can't hear you.
Mr. Oxman: There's some SDT returns from the defense. Just like permission to copy them.
The Court: They are subpoenas that come within the area that only you are allowed to see?
Mr. Oxman: Correct, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. Had you sought permission to copy them? Is there a problem, or --
Mr. Oxman: No, I don't think there's any problem. Just wanted to clarify it and make sure.
The Court: Okay. Thank you.
Mr. Oxman: All right.
Mr. Zonen: We'll agree that our copy can be turned over to us under seal.
Mr. Oxman: We'll remain silent, Your Honor.
The Court: Court's in recess.
Adjourn Message: The proceedings adjourned at 11:25 a.m.
