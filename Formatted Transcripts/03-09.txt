Star Arvizo: I don't remember that happening.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you don't know about that?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall being at Neverland around February 24th, 2003?
Star Arvizo: I don't know any of the dates.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember that your family went for a dental appointment?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And the dental appointment was with a Dr. Seamont, correct?
Star Arvizo: I don't remember the doctor's name, but he was a dentist.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You, your mother, Gavin went to the dentist, right?
Star Arvizo: Just me and my brother.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me. You and your brother?

Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How did you get to the dentist's?
Star Arvizo: By car.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know who drove you?

Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was he working at Neverland?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And whose car was it; do you know?
Star Arvizo: It was the cook's car.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Star Arvizo: It's a van.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And if you know, where was the dentist's office?
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was it nearby, to your knowledge?
Star Arvizo: We just drove there at night.
Mr. Mesereau: Drove there at night. Okay. And your mother wanted the dentist to remove Gavin's braces, right?
Star Arvizo: And also mine.
Mr. Mesereau: And your braces, too?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did the dentist remove your braces?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he remove Gavin's braces?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And the driver dropped you all off at the dentist's office, right?
Star Arvizo: No, he stood there with us.
Mr. Mesereau: Stood there with you in the dentist's office?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: In the lobby? Or was he with you when you were having your braces removed?
Star Arvizo: He was there standing next to us.
Mr. Mesereau: When you had your braces removed?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Who paid for that dental visit; do you know?
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did your mother tell the dentist to polish your teeth; do you know?
Star Arvizo: It was a long time ago.
Mr. Mesereau: Don't remember that?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall the dentist and his assistant asking you and your brother not to go into the dental supplies?
Star Arvizo: That was long — it was long ago. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Were there phones in the dentist's office?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't see any?
Star Arvizo: There was probably some at the front desk.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever call your mother asking you to use the phone?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Let me get back to the grand jury transcript. Okay?
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall telling the Santa Barbara Grand Jury that the first time you saw Mr. Jackson inappropriately touch your brother, that your brother was looking out towards the far wall?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what do you mean by that?
Star Arvizo: If you're looking at the bed –
Mr. Mesereau: Oh.
Star Arvizo: – like the picture we saw earlier –
Mr. Mesereau: Sure.
Star Arvizo: – he was facing to the right.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So correct me if I'm wrong, you said Mr. Jackson was lying flat, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes, on his back.
Mr. Mesereau: And he appeared to be sleeping or –
Star Arvizo: Who?
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Jackson appeared to be sleeping, correct?
Star Arvizo: No. No.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't appear to be sleeping?
Star Arvizo: He had his eyes closed, but he was masturbating.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So his eyes are closed. You say Mr. Jackson is masturbating, you say your brother is turned towards the far wall –
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: – right? And you're saying Mr. Jackson has his arm over your brother turned towards the far wall, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And Mr. Jackson is moving his hand, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, when you were speaking to the grand jury, you said there was vodka around, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, if you went up the stairs, there's no light over the bed, and you only see what you see for a few seconds, how do you see vodka?
Star Arvizo: The light from the stairwell, it wasn't just one light. It was like two lights or something like that. But it was bright enough to shine into the room.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you see all of this in a few seconds, with all the lights out over the bed, correct?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, did your mother ever complain to you that she wanted to leave the ranch?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know about when that was?
Star Arvizo: No. I don't know exactly.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling the Santa Barbara Grand Jury when you were asked the question, “Star, while you were at the ranch, did you ever have any discussions with your mother about the subject of her wanting to leave the ranch?” and your answer was, “No”?
Star Arvizo: I remember her saying it to me. Probably didn't even remember at that time.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you what you told the Santa Barbara Grand Jury?
Star Arvizo: You told me what I said.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to show you the transcript?
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to see that page of transcript?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you told the Santa Barbara Grand Jury under oath?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Your answer to the question was “No”, correct?
Star Arvizo: Yes, but probably at that time I didn't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: At that time you didn't remember?
Star Arvizo: Yes. Probably. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: So your memory's better now than it was when you testified before the Santa Barbara Grand Jury?
Star Arvizo: No, after you testify, you remember some things that you didn't say; that you forgot to say.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So your memory is better today than it was March 29th, 2004, right?
Mr. Sneddon: Object as argumentative, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever talk to your brother or sister about leaving the ranch?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Just another question about the door leading up to the stairwell to Michael's bedroom. You were asked questions about that while you were in front of the Santa Barbara Grand Jury, correct?
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You were asked questions by the prosecution?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you remember being asked the following question: “Now, on both occasion — on the first occasion, you said the door was sort of locked and it came loose. On the second occasion, can you tell us whether or not that door was open or closed?” And your answer was, “It was open. Well, the door was closed, but it was unlocked”. Why did you begin by saying, “It was open”?
Star Arvizo: Like the lock wasn't locked.
Mr. Mesereau: Your answer began with the words, “It was open”.
Star Arvizo: Yeah. The door –
Mr. Mesereau: Was it open?
Star Arvizo: If it was unlocked, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you didn't mean the door was open.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You just meant it was unlocked?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the Santa Barbara Grand Jury that the first time you saw Michael Jackson inappropriately touching your brother, you had about five or six seconds, and the second time three or four seconds, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told them both times the light was out above the bed?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, on both of these occasions that you've described as Mr. Michael Jackson inappropriately touching your brother, did your brother ever move?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know someone named Kiki –
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: – who works at Neverland? Who's Kiki?
Star Arvizo: She's a — I don't know what her — she's a house -cleaning lady.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have a dispute with her?
Star Arvizo: No. We're friends.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You're friends to this day?
Star Arvizo: I don't know. I haven't talked to her.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When did you last see her?
Star Arvizo: At Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me?
Star Arvizo: At Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know when you last spoke to her?
Star Arvizo: At Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So that's quite a while ago, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the Santa Barbara Grand Jury that on a flight coming back from Miami, Dr. Farshshian was facing Michael Jackson, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: So he would have been facing Michael Jackson when you claim Michael started licking your brother's hair, right?
Star Arvizo: No, my mom was — she was turned around most of the time.
Mr. Mesereau: No, I'm talking about Dr. Farshshian.
Star Arvizo: Oh, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: He was facing Michael Jackson the whole time?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you never reported either of these two times you claim Mr. Jackson was inappropriately touching your brother, right?
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object as vague as to time.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll rephrase it. He's right.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't immediately go to your mother and report that, did you, when you saw it happen?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't immediately go to your father and report it, right?
Star Arvizo: My dad wasn't there.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't immediately tell Davellin about it, right?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you say you never slept in the theater, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Star Arvizo: Only my sister and Marie Nicole did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you didn't?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: “Yes” means you never slept there, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When your father was with you at Neverland, did you ever sleep in Michael Jackson's room?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times?
Star Arvizo: Once.
Mr. Mesereau: That was the first time you visited Neverland, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And every other time your father was there, you didn't sleep in Michael's room, correct?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: But you're saying the first time you visited Neverland, your father let you sleep in Michael's room?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was your mother there on that trip?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did your mother let you sleep in Michael's room?
Star Arvizo: She was probably with my sister. We just asked our dad.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you all had dinner in the main house that night, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was there a discussion at the dinner table about whether or not you and Gavin could sleep in Michael Jackson's room?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did your mother at any time when she was at Neverland ever ask you where you were sleeping in the main house?
Star Arvizo: I don't remember. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember telling the Santa Barbara Grand Jury that your mother never asked you one time where you were sleeping in the main house?
Star Arvizo: I don't know if I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you the page from the grand jury transcript?
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: May I, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page of the grand jury transcript?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you told the Santa Barbara Grand Jury?
Star Arvizo: Yes. I said, “I think so. I don't remember”, on the transcript.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you said in response to the question, “Did your mother ever ask you where you were sleeping inside the main house?” You said, “No ”.
Star Arvizo: And right below it, it says, “I think so. I don't remember ”.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know, or not?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: It says, “Did you ever have a conversation with” – And you go, “Wait. I think so. I don't remember ”. Is that what you're referring to?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you're not sure if you did?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You never did at the dinner table, though?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, then we went further, Star. It says you said, “No”, and you said, “I think so ”. “Let me ask the question again: Did your mother ever talk with you about where you slept inside the main house? 22 “A. No”.
Star Arvizo: But I don't think so. I don't really remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You don't remember saying that to the grand jury, or you don't remember if you talked to your mom about it?
Star Arvizo: I don't remember if I talked to my mom about it. done so, Your Honor, but I think I'd like to read that portion of the grand jury –
The Court: Give me that citation. I have the transcript now.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, Your Honor. It's page 1585. Actually, let me start before that. It's page 1584, lines 22 to 28, and page 1585, lines 1 to 6.
Mr. Sneddon: The second page, how far did you end up?
The Court: Do you have a volume?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, I think I do. It would be Volume 6. No, it's Volume 7.
The Court: I have it. Thank you.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Thank you, Your Honor. “Q. Did your mother ever ask you where you were sleeping inside the main house? “A. No. “Q. Did you ever have a conversation with – “A. Wait. I think so. I don't remember. “Q. I'm sorry? “A. I think so. I don't remember. “Q. I don't? “A. I think so. I don't remember. “Q. You said 'No', and you said, 'I think so'. Let me ask the question again: Did your mother ever talk with you about where you slept inside the main house? 3 “A. No”.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember you told the Santa Barbara Grand Jury that you saw Michael Jackson touching your brother a lot?
Star Arvizo: Probably. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: You said he would try to fix your brother's shirt. Do you remember that?
Star Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: You said he would be touching him a lot, right?
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: You said, “He would, like, fix his shirt”. Do you remember that?
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you that page of the transcript?
Star Arvizo: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at those pages?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do they refresh your recollection about what you told the Santa Barbara Grand Jury?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You were asked the question, “He would be touching him a lot?” “A. Yeah. “Q. Not his genitals, not his penis? “A. I never saw that”.
Star Arvizo: At the table.
Mr. Mesereau: “I saw it in the paper”.
Star Arvizo: I saw it on paper?
Mr. Mesereau: That's what you said, right?
Star Arvizo: I don't know what I meant by saying not on paper.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, at the time you claim you watched Mr. Jackson in his bedroom inappropriately touch your brother, you were approximately five -feet-two; is that right?
Star Arvizo: Sure. Yeah. I don't — I don't remember how exactly — how tall I was.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the grand jury you were five-feet- two, right?
Star Arvizo: I was just guessing.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you think you were five-feet -two?
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you have any idea?
Star Arvizo: (Shakes head from side to side.)
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the Santa Barbara Grand Jury on both of the occasions when you claim you saw Mr. Jackson in bed with your brother, you never went to the top of the stairs, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you claim that both occasions when you saw Mr. Jackson and your brother, they were not under the sheets, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said they were on top of a blanket, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: At this time, Your Honor, I'd like to play a video, DVD. It would be –
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, if I may, just for bookkeeping purposes, we'd like to have marked for identification next in order a video that's entitled, “Neverland Channel Demo”.
Bailiff Cortez: Can't hear you.
Mr. Sanger: Oh. Sorry. I'd like to mark — to mark next in order a video or CD that is labeled “Neverland Channel Demo”. We have discuss ed this with the District Attorney, Mr. Sneddon. He has no objection to our playing it.
The Court: What's the exhibit number, then?
The Clerk: It's 5003.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Thank you.
The Bailiff: Do you want it on the box?
Mr. Sanger: And if it's acceptable to the Court, we'll play it at this time.
The Bailiff: Are you playing it out of your computer or –
Mr. Sanger: We're going to play it.
The Bailiff: It's “Input 4”.
The Court: So it's admitted into evidence. There's no objection?
Mr. Sneddon: There is none, Your Honor.
The Clerk: I'm sorry, Judge. That should be Exhibit 5002. I skipped one.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, I think we need the screen.
The Court: You need “Input” –
The Bailiff: “4”.
The Court: “4”? Are you ready?
Mr. Sanger: I hope so. (Whereupon, a DVD, Defendant's Exhibit 5002, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, you can turn the screen off.
The Court: Thank you.
Mr. Mesereau: Star, you had asked Michael Jackson to help you be in a video like that?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You never asked Michael Jackson to help you do that video?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Your brother wanted Michael Jackson to help him do a video also, didn't he?
Star Arvizo: I can't speak for my brother.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You never heard your brother ask Michael Jackson that?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: So as far as you know, Michael Jackson knew nothing about this video you were putting together at Neverland?
Star Arvizo: No. He asked me if I wanted to be in it, and I said, “Yes”.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told him you wanted to narrate a video, correct?
Star Arvizo: No. I just said, “Okay ”.
Mr. Mesereau: You never told Michael Jackson you wanted to be the narrator?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never told Michael Jackson you wanted to be the center of attention on the Neverland Channel video, right?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So Michael Jackson, in your mind, was not doing you a favor when he helped you make this video?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And in your mind, Michael Jackson was not doing Gavin a favor when he helped you make this video, right?
Star Arvizo: We didn't have no one to interview, so we interviewed my brother.
Mr. Mesereau: No one to interview. You had kids everywhere, didn't you?
Star Arvizo: No, not at that time. They brought them.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, did your mother know you were making this video?
Star Arvizo: I don't know if she did or not.
Mr. Mesereau: Never told her?
Star Arvizo: Long time ago. I don't know if she did or not.
Mr. Mesereau: But you don't recall ever telling your mother that you and Gavin were going to make this video at Neverland?
Star Arvizo: My dad knew.
Mr. Mesereau: Did your mother know?
Star Arvizo: I don't know. I can't speak for my mom.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember ever telling your mom, “We're going to make a video at Neverland”?
Star Arvizo: No. I don't remember telling her.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you think she knew about it before you made it?
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Sneddon: Object as asked and answered.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll withdraw it. I'll withdraw.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you ever recall Gavin telling your mother, “We're going to make a video at Neverland”?
Star Arvizo: I can't speak for my brother, and I can't speak for my mom.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm just asking what you heard. Okay? You never heard him discuss it with your mother, right?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: After this video was made, did you ever show it to your mother?
Star Arvizo: We never got a copy, so I was unable to show it to my mom.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever watch it at Neverland?
Star Arvizo: No. After we recorded it, we never saw it.
Mr. Mesereau: So you've never seen it since you made it, right?
Star Arvizo: We saw it at Hamid's house, while we were about to do the rebuttal.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: I found it at Hamid's house.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, but you were there with your mother then.
Star Arvizo: When?
Mr. Mesereau: At Hamid's. That's where you filmed the rebuttal video.
Star Arvizo: My mom, when I got there, she wasn't there. She hasn't — well, she didn't arrive at that time when I watched it. Vinnie was still picking her up from St. Andrews.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So who watched the video at Hamid's house?
Star Arvizo: I think it was me, my brother, and probably my sister.
Mr. Mesereau: And you never wanted your mother to see it?
Star Arvizo: I didn't care if she saw it or not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Gavin saw it at Hamid's house?
Star Arvizo: Okay, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you saw it at Hamid's house?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How do you know the video was at Hamid's house?
Star Arvizo: We were hooking up the Play Station to play “Need for Speed 2”, and we saw it above his DVD player.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that's the first time you had seen it, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And were you excited when you made the video?
Star Arvizo: I was kind of tired.
Mr. Mesereau: You were kind of tired when you made this video?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: The Neverland Channel?
Star Arvizo: Okay. Whatever you call it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you weren't too excited when you made it, right?
Star Arvizo: I was kind of sleepy.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And were you excite d when it finally got put together?
Star Arvizo: What do you mean?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, when it finally was completed, were you excited?
Star Arvizo: At the end of the day?
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me?
Star Arvizo: I don't –
Mr. Mesereau: I'm sorry, let me just rephrase the question. I'll withdraw it. When this video was completed, how old were you?
Star Arvizo: When we record ed it?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: Fourth grade.
Mr. Mesereau: Fourth grade?
Star Arvizo: Yeah, I had long hair in fourth grade.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm sorry, pardon me?
Star Arvizo: I had long hair in fourth grade.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How old do you think you were when you made this video?
Star Arvizo: I don't know. I was probably about 10 or 18 11.
Mr. Mesereau: And my question to you is, were you excited to narrate a video like this at Neverland?
Star Arvizo: No. I was sleepy.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All the time?
Star Arvizo: What? During that — no, I slept really late last night. Well, that night.
Mr. Mesereau: That night you were sleepy. When you found out you had narrated a video called “The Neverland Channel” at Michael Jackson's ranch, my question to you is, were you excited about it?
Star Arvizo: And I said no.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, with the Court's permission, we're going to ask to play Exhibit 340, which is already in evidence.
The Court: All right. That's a DVD?
Mr. Sanger: Yes, sir. Your Honor, just for the record, there are two disks in 340, Disk 1 and 2. And I'm going to put Disk 1 in at this time.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, can I ask a procedural question before we begin this?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Since we've already seen it, is this a situation where we're going to play a portion of it and ask questions about it, or are we just going to look at the whole video again, which I think would be repetitive?
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sanger: Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: I can answer that question. We are going to — next we're going to play the rebuttal video, with your permission, Your Honor, and we're going to stop it and ask questions about it, as we go, of the witness, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Sorry.
The Bailiff: You need to use your microphone.
Mr. Sanger: We're going to — we had a technical problem. We're going to ask, then, that a DVD that's entitled, “Michael Jackson and Gavin, Neverland 9-6-0-0”, that that be marked as defense next in order, and we would like to play that. We have discussed this with the District Attorney, and he has no objection to the foundation or to us playing it. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, we talked about it. That's fine.
The Court: This one would be 5003, then.
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, this I would play and then ask questions after it. The rebuttal video I would be asking questions throughout it. Thank you.
The Court: There's no objection to it going in evidence, then?
Mr. Sneddon: No, Your Honor, there is not.
The Court: It's admitted.
Mr. Sanger: Just before we start…. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Are you ready? (Whereupon, a DVD, Defendant's Exhibit 5003, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: Star, have you seen that video before?
Star Arvizo: I think so, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, your mother showed that video to the three social workers when they came to Jay Jackson's apartment to interview her about her fitness as a mother and what Michael Jackson had done, correct?
Star Arvizo: I don't remember that.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, she showed that video to the social workers to let them know that Michael Jackson had tried to help heal your brother from cancer, right?
Star Arvizo: Are you telling me this, or –
Mr. Mesereau: I'm asking a question.
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember seeing it with the three social workers?
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object. Asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: When you appeared in this video, your family had asked Michael Jackson to help them with Gavin, who they thought was dying of cancer, right?
Star Arvizo: I never heard my family say that.
Mr. Mesereau: Never heard anyone in your family say, “Michael, would you please help us, our son is dying of cancer”?
Star Arvizo: Probably did. I wasn't there.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, it's your understanding that Michael Jackson met your brother because your brother was at Kaiser, in the hospital, and wanted to talk to Michael Jackson, right?
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that your understanding?
Star Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And your entire family wanted to come to Neverland and asked Michael if he would help them with your brother, who was dying of cancer, right?
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object. Assumes a fact not in evidence.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever hear your mother ask Michael Jackson to please help your family because Gavin has terminal cancer, or words to that effect?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember hearing Michael Jackson talk about Pac Man and how you can eat up cancer cells?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never heard that?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Ever hear Michael Jackson encourage your brother to get better, that he could survive this?
Star Arvizo: When?
Mr. Mesereau: One time?
Star Arvizo: No, I said when?
Mr. Mesereau: Anytime.
Star Arvizo: Probably told him over the phone.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me?
Star Arvizo: Probably told him over the phone. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, Michael Jackson spent a lot of time with your brother at Neverland trying to encourage him to beat cancer, right?
Mr. Sneddon: Objection, Your Honor. Calls for facts not in evidence; lack of foundation.
The Court: Overruled. He's asking your knowledge, if you know that.
Star Arvizo: Michael was only there with Gavin a couple times while he was at Neverland. He wasn't there the whole entire cancer.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I didn't ask you that. Let me just ask the question again, because you probably didn't understand it. To your knowledge –
The Court: Counsel, he answered your question. Please ask another question.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: I don't want you commenting like that.
Mr. Mesereau: I apologize, Your Honor. I withdraw that comment.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you last see this particular video, if you know?
Star Arvizo: I don't remember, but it was a long time ago.
Mr. Mesereau: At this point, Your Honor, we'd like to play the rebuttal video, which is in evidence.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
Mr. Sanger: For the record, that would be Exhibit 340 and we're going to start with Tape 1 of 2. Actually, it says Tape 1 of 2, but it would be DVD 1 of 2.
The Bailiff: I'm not sure if that's –
Mr. Sanger: That's on the film.
The Bailiff: Oh.
Mr. Sanger: It will be over in a second. Sorry. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 1, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: Now, Star, when you made those comments, were you telling the truth?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you lying?
Star Arvizo: I was actually talking about my stepdad.
Mr. Mesereau: You weren't talking about Michael Jackson?
Star Arvizo: No; how Jay stepped in and took over where my dad left off.
Mr. Mesereau: So when you said, “My first impression was like a father. He actually seemed more fatherly -like than my biological father. He – there is — I just — that was my first impression of Michael”, you were really talking about Jay Jackson?
Star Arvizo: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Why did you use the name “Michael”?
Star Arvizo: Well, because he told us to say good things only about — because he told us only to say good things about Michael.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you really were referring to Jay Jackson?
Star Arvizo: Exactly.
Mr. Mesereau: I see. Okay. We can keep going through. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 1, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: Now, Star, when you heard your mother make those comments about Michael Jackson, did you think she was talking about Jay Jackson?
Star Arvizo: I wasn't really listening. I was like practically falling off my chair.
Mr. Mesereau: So you didn't really hear any of this?
Star Arvizo: No, I was really sleepy. It was like 4:00 in the morning.
Mr. Mesereau: So you really don't know what your mother was talking about?
Star Arvizo: No. I –
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. We can keep going. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 1, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you said — Davellin says about Michael, “He gives Gavin advice”, and then you say, “He helps me with homework”, right?
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that the truth?
Star Arvizo: No. We didn't even have homework.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that a lie?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: We can keep going. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 1, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: Star, do you remember making those comments about Michael Jackson?
Star Arvizo: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you telling the truth?
Star Arvizo: No, not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you lying?
Star Arvizo: Yeah. On there, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: So you were lying. So when you said Michael lets you feel like his son, you weren't telling the truth?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you said he lets you call him “father”, you weren't telling the truth?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: “And we call him 'father' and he calls us 'son'”, you weren't telling the truth?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you say, “He helps us with basically anything we ask and we love him”. When you said that, you weren't telling the truth, right?
Star Arvizo: Repeat it.
Mr. Mesereau: “He helps us with basically anything we ask and we love him”. You're saying you weren't telling the truth?
Star Arvizo: Yes. The only reason why we did that is because Dieter told us to.
Mr. Mesereau: So everybody just memorized all these lines?
Star Arvizo: I just said whatever came to my head.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay.
Star Arvizo: I was trying to get out of there. I was kind of tired.
Mr. Mesereau: I understand. So, so far every statement you've made is a lie, you're saying, right?
Star Arvizo: Basically, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. We can keep going. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 1, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: Star, you heard your mother make those remarks, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you think she was lying?
Star Arvizo: I wasn't really paying attention.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me?
Star Arvizo: Um, I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know, right?
Star Arvizo: Yeah, I can't speak for her.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm just asking what you thought. Did you think your mother was telling lies when she made that statement?
Star Arvizo: I wasn't really paying attention.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 1, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: Now, Star, when you heard your mother make the statement, “He claimed these three little munchkins as his kids”, did you think your mother was telling the truth?
Star Arvizo: Um, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you think your mother was lying?
Star Arvizo: No, she was doing what Dieter asked her to do. do. a spontaneous kind of way when she answered these questions, right?
Star Arvizo: I don't know. It was her emotions.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 1, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: Star, did you ever discuss with your mother the idea that Michael Jackson would be a father figure to you?
Star Arvizo: To me?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever discuss with your mother the notion that Michael Jackson would be a father figure to Gavin?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever discuss with your mother the idea that Michael Jackson would be a father figure for your sister?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: So you and your mother never talked about Michael Jackson being any kind of a father figure at all, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Keep going. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 1, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: Now, Star, are you telling the jury, under oath, you never heard Michael Jackson ever mention anything about Pac Man to your brother?
Star Arvizo: No. I was yawning in the video –
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me?
Star Arvizo: I don't remember even hearing that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 1, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, that's — actually, that does that, and that's the end of this tape, so I'm going to stop it, if that's all right.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Star, you heard your mother say all of her children want to be in movies. Is that a true statement?
Star Arvizo: No, I don't want to be in movies.
Mr. Mesereau: So is your mother lying?
Star Arvizo: No, she's doing what Dieter told her to do.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. So as far as you know, none of the children wanted to be in movies; is that right?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I would object. Assumes facts not in evidence.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Star Arvizo: What was the question again?
Mr. Mesereau: As far as you know, neither you, Gavin or Davellin ever wanted to be in movies?
Mr. Sneddon: It's compound now.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You've said you never wanted to be in movies, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes. I'm too shy to act.
The Court: You're going to put in the other disk?
Mr. Sanger: I put in Disk 2, if that's all right, Your Honor.
The Court: Okay. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 2, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: Star, do you know what your mother is referring to when she mentioned “gang signs”?
Star Arvizo: Probably the guy behind the camera was doing something.
Mr. Mesereau: You say “probably ”. Is that something you thought at the time?
Star Arvizo: At that time?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: No. I was just thinking about sleep.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you think your mother was talking about a cameraman making gang signs? Is that what she was saying?
Star Arvizo: She was pointing at off camera, so it couldn't be the cameraman. It had to be someone else.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Let me just get this straight. You think she was talking about the cameraman –
Star Arvizo: No, I know she was talking about not the cameraman, but someone off camera.
Mr. Mesereau: Making gang signs?
Star Arvizo: They probably weren't even doing gang signs. He was probably doing a signal or something. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: But I think what you're saying is you don't know what she was referring to, right?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, was it your — are you telling the jury that while all this was going on, your family was being falsely imprisoned?
Mr. Sneddon: Objection. Argumentative, Your Honor. It's a legal conclusion using those words.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you feel that while this was all going on, your family was not free to leave?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And do you think the way your mother was acting, that she was in fear?
Star Arvizo: I don't know. I can't speak for her.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you in fear?
Star Arvizo: I was just sleepy.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 2, was played for the Court and jury.)
The Court: Hold on, please. Take our break.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, Your Honor.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor. Oops.
The Court: Do you want me to — are you ready to continue with the film?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please, Your Honor. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 2, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: Star, the person who's doing the interview says, “Davellin, Star, when you guys first went to the ranch, I'm sure you were pretty down ”. When you first went to Neverland Ranch, were you pretty down?
Star Arvizo: The first ever time?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were down because your brother was ill, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Keep going. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 2, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: Now, Star, when you made that statement, were you telling the truth?
Star Arvizo: What was the statement?
Mr. Mesereau: The statement was, “The first time before our brother ever went to the ranch, he was always sad, he was always crying, he was always just down all the time. When he went to the ranch, he was always happy. He was always playful. He was happy again. He was cheerful, and it also gave him something to look forward when we left ”. Was that a true statement?
Star Arvizo: It was kind of true, because my brother was sad and — what's the other word I used? Well, he was sad and down, because he was going through a life-threatening disease.
Mr. Mesereau: And he was happy at the ranch, correct?
Star Arvizo: Yes. In the beginning, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 2, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: At this point, Star, you're trying to speak out, correct?
Star Arvizo: No. I was just saying I was sleepy.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, he said he can hear you, Star, right?
Star Arvizo: Yeah. I was complaining.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your understanding that this film was supposed to be on a television show?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn that this film was supposed to appear on FOX Television?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. We can go forward. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 340, Disk 2, was played for the Court and jury.)
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, there's a final piece of evidence we'd like to use that the prosecution wants to look at. It's on DVD. It's a card on DVD, and I think — is it true you have that?
Mr. Sneddon: No. You came up at the break and asked me for something, and it's locked up in evidence at the sheriff's department.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, we have it. I said we'd show it to him. And we're going to try to use — we're going to try to use the electronic version, and then they'll bring the actual piece of evidence over later, and we can substitute that. So with the Court's indulgence, we need just a minute for them to huddle over here, or somebody to take a look at it, if that's all right.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you have it?
Mr. Sanger: I have it right here. It's on the screen.
Mr. Sneddon: Oh, it's on your computer.
Mr. Sanger: Yeah. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, I have no objection to them using that in lieu of the original for right now, and we'll get the original over here, if not today, tomorrow.
The Court: All right. We will give it a number now. So it will be 5004. And we'll mark the original when you bring it over.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, I believe there are three cards, if I'm not mistaken. But we can mark them as a group as 5004. We don't have to give them separate numbers, unless the Court wants to.
The Court: Okay. Well, let's mark them, three cards, as a group, numbered 5004.
Mr. Sanger: May I walk around here? I have to hook the thing up to the screen. Is that all right, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
The Bailiff: It will be “Input 1”.
The Court: “Input 1”, okay.
The Bailiff: And Mr. Mesereau, can you hit the “PC” button?
The Court: These are agreed they go in evidence? No objection to them going into evidence?
Mr. Sneddon: No, none whatsoever, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. They're admitted. 5004 is admitted.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Star –
The Bailiff: You need to hit “Black Screen”.
Mr. Mesereau: – you have sent greeting cards from time to time?
Star Arvizo: Your microphone's not on.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me? You're right.
The Court: They're having trouble hearing you.
Mr. Mesereau: You're right.
Mr. Mesereau: You have sent greeting cards from time to time to people whom you asked for money, true?
Mr. Sneddon: Object; assumes facts not in evidence.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: The language that you hear on that rebuttal tape is language similar to language you have used in greeting cards to people you were seeking money from, right?
Star Arvizo: We were never seeking –
Mr. Sneddon: Object, Your Honor. I object. Assumes facts not in evidence.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll start again.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know Louise Palanker?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How long have you known Louise Palanker?
Star Arvizo: Since the comedy camp.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you still in touch with her?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you last talk to Louise Palanker?
Star Arvizo: I think my sister talked to her. I haven't talked to her since — I don't know exactly. But it was — it was within this year. Well –
Mr. Mesereau: You — I'm sorry.
Star Arvizo: It was within the last year.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You sent Louise Palanker greeting cards and you called her “Mommy”, correct?
Star Arvizo: I don't remember doing that.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if you see a greeting card that you signed?
Star Arvizo: Sure.
Mr. Sanger: I take it Your Honor has it on the one where –
The Court: I have it on “1”. Do you want me to try it on “4”?
Mr. Sanger: May as well.
The Court: That's “4”. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: I have a suggestion.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Since he's only asking him to refresh his recollection, just take the computer and show it to him.
Mr. Mesereau: We've moved it into evidence, Your Honor. I'd like the jury to see it, if we can.
The Court: It is in evidence.
The Bailiff: It will just be a minute.
The Court: Do you have a technician coming?
The Bailiff: We do.
The Court: There's someone coming to help. I remember when an attorney just had to be able to come into court and talk. (Laughter.)
The Court: Now they're froze n if the machine doesn't work.
Mr. Sanger: I understand there's somebody coming down in one second.
The Court: Yes, somebody's been –
Mr. Mesereau: I can ask a few questions in the meantime, if you'd like, Your Honor.
The Court: That would be good.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know whether or not Louise Palanker gave $20,000 to your family?
Star Arvizo: I know that she gave it to my dad, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know what the purpose for giving that money was?
Star Arvizo: To fix my brother's bedroom at my grandma's house, so he can live in it.
The Court: Would you like to wait just a moment, so –
Mr. Mesereau: Sure.
The Court: It would be better to let the technician…. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sanger: Oh, how about that? Your Honor, I just learned something new.
The Bailiff: So everything is ready.
The Court: Yes. Thank you.
The Technician: No problem.
Mr. Mesereau: You asked Louise Palanker for a computer, didn't you?
Star Arvizo: No. That's not my writing.
Mr. Mesereau: We'll get to that. There's some other pages.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever ask Louise Palanker for a computer?
Star Arvizo: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you aware of anyone else in your family asking Louise for a computer?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever get a computer from Louise, to your knowledge?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, I want to show you this card. It says, “From your boys and girl, Louise Mommy ”. Do you see that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: It says, “You're smiling when I'm happy and you hug me when I'm hurt”. Do you see that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you call Louise “Mommy”?
Star Arvizo: Looks like my sister's writing.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me ask you if you called her “Mommy”, ever?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever hear your sister or Gavin call her “Mommy”?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know why a card was sent to her that said “Mommy”?
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Let's go to some other pages, if we can, Bob. Thanks. Now, who is in that picture?
Star Arvizo: Me, my brother, my sister.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know approximately when those photos were taken?
Star Arvizo: When my sister was in the Los Angeles Explorers.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know about what year that is?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Let's look at this, then. Do you see the message at the bottom?
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: It says, “Dear Louise, I think of you every second of my like (sic) and pray for every night, every morning. I love you. I wish I can spend time with you. Love, Star”, right?
Star Arvizo: I misspelled “life”.
Mr. Mesereau: That's your writing, though, isn't it?
Star Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. The question I have is, you see a message from Gavin and a message from Davellin, right?
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: And why is everybody calling her “Mommy”; do you know?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object to that question.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me, I'll rephrase it.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you have any idea why the card is addressed to “Mommy”?
Star Arvizo: “Mommy's” not –
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me?
Star Arvizo: “Mommy's” not in my letter.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm asking about the card.
Star Arvizo: I don't know what's written on there. Doesn't look like my writing.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see the card before you wrote on it, if you remember?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: But did you refer to her as “Mommy” ever?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Asked and answered, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Let's go to the next card. Okay. Now, this is another card.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: It says, “Dear Louise, once I see you, my day is wonderful. Louise, I miss you. I love you. Every day I want to be with you. Thank you. I love you. Love, Star”. Do you see that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you often send cards to Louise?
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember how many you might have sent?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Keep going. Do you see that card, Star?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: It says, “Our darling Louise, Wheezy”. Do you see that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that says, “We dearly love you and care about you. We love you to the moon and back. Faith fully, devotedly, your friends, your family, Davellin, David, Gavin, Janet, Star ”. Do you see that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you used to refer to Louise as being in your family?
Star Arvizo: Not really. Just my brother probably did, because she was with my brother during the whole cancer.
Mr. Mesereau: The question I want to ask you is this: Did you typically call people “family” that your mother was seeking funds from?
Star Arvizo: My mom was never seeking funds from –
Mr. Mesereau: She never did that with anybody?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Not Chris Tucker?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Not Louise?
Star Arvizo: No. You can even ask Louise. My dad was the one trying to seek funds from her.
Mr. Mesereau: And your mother was never involved in that at all?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: How about with Jay Leno?
Star Arvizo: I've never met Jay Leno in my life.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you aware of your mother ever seeking funds from him?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I have no further questions.
The Court: Redirect? Are you through with this exhibit?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, Your Honor.
The Court: Do you need it?
Mr. Sneddon: No, I don't need it. Your Honor, I'm going to need a moment to get a couple of photographs from the clerk, if you don't mind.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, while that's occurring, did the Court want to –
The Bailiff: You have to use the microphone.
Mr. Sanger: I'm sorry. Did the Court want to have us lodge this DVD with the Court until the physical exhibits are here?
The Court: That would be a good idea.
Mr. Sanger: All right.
The Court: Just temporarily. Temporary Exhibit 5004.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, with your permission, I'd like to show the exhibits — the witness some exhibits and put them up on the board. And I'm specifically — we're going to start with People's No. 50 in evidence.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. SNEDDON:
Mr. Sneddon: Star, let me begin by asking you some questions about Mr. Jackson's bedroom. How many floors are there to his bedroom?
Star Arvizo: One.
Mr. Sneddon: And how many floors are there in the suite to his bedroom?
Star Arvizo: In the suite?
Mr. Sneddon: Well, let me ask — let me show you a photograph.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Let me do it this way. I don't want to get sidetracked here. You told the ladies and gentlemen of the jury during your testimony that on the occasion that you saw Mr. Jackson lying on the bed with your brother, that you had to walk up some stairs.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that correct?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And so is the bedroom where you saw those activities occur on the same level as the area below?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to have to do it one at a time while I'm down here. Now, the exhibit that you have that's in front of you that's People's 50, do you see that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, what door is that? Where does that lead to?
Star Arvizo: That's leading to a hallway that leads to the second double door into his bedroom.
Mr. Sneddon: And in relation to this particular door, is this the door you go through that sets off the sensors?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where about, when you go through those doors, do you actually hear it?
Star Arvizo: A little after you pass the duck. The duck.
Mr. Sneddon: And can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what is the sound that you hear when it goes off?
Star Arvizo: It's hard to explain. But it goes like “doom -doom-doom”. Something like that.
Mr. Sneddon: How long do you think it is?
Star Arvizo: Couple seconds.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that the only sound that goes off?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: The exhibit number on that photograph, I believe, is 53; is that correct?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you see in that photograph what you were referring to in answering Mr. Mesereau's questions as the sensors?
Star Arvizo: What do you mean?
Mr. Sneddon: Well, he asked you about some sensors. Do you remember that?
Star Arvizo: Oh, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And what were you referring to? Do you see anything in that photograph that you were referring to in answering his questions?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. What is it?
Star Arvizo: It's the silver one to the right of the picture. It's under the picture of a little girl.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, just wait a second. All right. Now, show the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what you were referring to just a moment ago.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: So there's one on each side?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, is there a separate key pad entry that you have to touch to get in?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you were answering Mr. Mesereau's questions, you indicated that there was a double door you had to go through to get into Mr. Jackson's bedroom.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you see the double doors that you were referring to in your testimony to Mr. Mesereau?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you point them out to the jury in this photograph?
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: So you're indicating in the middle of the photograph, one on the right and one on the left?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: I've now handed you People's 54. Do you recognize that photograph?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, what is that?
Star Arvizo: That's the view inside Michael's bedroom.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, do you see in that photograph the double doors you were referring to in answering Mr. Mesereau's questions?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Would you point it out to the jury?
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: You're indicating to the right and to the left of the photograph?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, directly ahead in that photograph, do you see that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What is that? What part of the room is that?
Star Arvizo: That's the downstairs.
Mr. Sneddon: The downstairs to what?
Star Arvizo: Michael's bedroom. That's the big area.
Mr. Sneddon: That's the what?
Star Arvizo: That's the big area.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, earlier in your testimony the other day, when we were going through — and I'm not going to walk through all of them, but we were going through the photographs, you identified an area as a bathroom that had a tub in it. Do you recall that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What floor is that on?
Star Arvizo: The first floor.
Mr. Sneddon: And the area with the piano?
Star Arvizo: It's on the first floor also.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, in that photograph, if one were to enter those doors and want to go to Mr. Jackson's bedroom – okay? – which way would they turn after they come through those doors?
Star Arvizo: You would turn to the right.
Mr. Sneddon: And then after you turn to the right, where would you have to go?
Star Arvizo: You would have to open up a door and turn to your left and walk up the stairs.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you know approximately how much distance there is between the time you enter the door and turn right, before you get to the door?
Star Arvizo: Like 17 stairs.
Mr. Sneddon: No, no, that's not what I asked you. What I asked you was, when you turn to the right through this door, before you get to the door that leads to the stairway, approximately how far is that?
Star Arvizo: Eight feet.
Mr. Auchincloss: Your Honor, could you black the screen just for a moment? (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: Now — do you want to put that back up?
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you, Your Honor. That's fine.
Mr. Sneddon: Put the other one back up. I have one last question on the original one. There we go.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Star, you indicated to Mr. Mesereau that there was a door that had several locks on it from the inside. Do you recall that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And can you tell us which door or doors it is that has those locks? So you're referring — and the exhibit number on that, Star?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Hate to interrupt you, but — what's the exhibit number on that? 13 A. 54.
Mr. Sneddon: 54. So you were indicating the two doors to the entrance to the bedroom?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, are those doors visible in this photograph or on the other side of the doors?
Star Arvizo: The other side of the doors.
Mr. Sneddon: And what kind of locks are they?
Star Arvizo: Um, there's two at the top — well, one on each door at the top. And you have to push it till it locks. And on the bottom, it's like the same thing, but you're pushing down.
Mr. Sneddon: So you counted each one of those things as a lock?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And what else was locked, do you consider a lock?
Star Arvizo: The key pad. It will lock the — I don't know what it's called, but it's that (indicating). Not the doorknob. It was like — well, it will just unlock it.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was the key pad that unlocked it? Back over there that you showed us on that other photograph?
Star Arvizo: Yes. And there's a lock that you just twist, and there's one more lock. Wait. Wait, I think there's just six, then.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. In any case, those were what you considered the locks that you were talking about with the jury?
Star Arvizo: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, let's go to the –
Star Arvizo: Six.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. We have a photograph marked as People's 72. It's in evidence. Do you see that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that the one you have in front of you right now?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to that particular photograph, there is a door depicted in that particular photograph. Do you see that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to your testimony and the answering of the questions of Mr. Mesereau yesterday and today, do you see the door that you were referring to that leads to Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Can you point that out to the jury?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And that's the door that is indicated about two-thirds of the way over on the left-hand side of the photograph?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Right by the stairwell?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, is that door a different — is that door different from the one you showed us before that you come into the entryway?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Pardon?
Star Arvizo: Well, yes, it's different. It's a single door.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you referred to a door the first time that you went up the stairs that was — that you thought was locked until you pushed it the second time, is that the door you're referring to?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, Star, you can put that down if you'd like. And we can turn the lights on, if you'd like, Your Honor. Just a couple of other things that have to do with the residence. You indicated in your testimony that you needed a combination for pads to get into certain locations in Mr. Jackson's — at Neverland Ranch.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you've described some of the locations that you needed the pad to get into certain locations. Did you need a combination to get into the arcade?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you need a combination to get into Mr. Jackson's office?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did the combination that you had work?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you need a combination to get into the theater?
Star Arvizo: I think it was locked with a key.
Mr. Sneddon: With a key?
Star Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you know where they kept the key?
Star Arvizo: No, I think security had the key. I don't know who exactly had the key.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the kitchen, did you need a pad to get into the kitchen?
Star Arvizo: No, it was open.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you told us about entering the front door, but there is a rear entrance to Mr. Jackson's residence, correct?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you need to have a combination to get in there?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And the same combination you've described in answering both my questions and Mr. Mesereau's, that combination worked?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, speaking of the kitchen, Mr. Mesereau asked you about being in the kitchen, and you indicated that you had been out there looking around for some utensils to cook.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Will you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury why you were in the kitchen cooking?
Star Arvizo: Because sometimes the cooks didn't cook it right, so I cooked some stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you like to cook?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that one of your hobbies?
Star Arvizo: One of my hobbies, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: One other thing, just — when you answered Mr. Mesereau's question and you said that Gavin went to Neverland Valley Ranch when he was seriously ill; do you recall that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What did you mean by that?
Star Arvizo: He was seriously ill and he went to Neverland Ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: What did you mean by “seriously ill”?
Star Arvizo: He had cancer.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that what you meant?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: How did you find out that there was a telescope up on the hill?
Star Arvizo: We — me, my brother and — I don't remember who, but me, my brother and someone else were riding up there with our ATV's and we saw a trail, and so we went up there, and we found like a glass table and — it was like a covered area. And there was a telescope that was mounted right there.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I'm going to ask you some questions now about some things that Mr. Mesereau asked you about. Okay?
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, do you remember Mr. Mesereau asking you about the incident that you described where Mr. Jackson got on the bed and scooted over towards your brother, and I think Mr. Mesereau said put his arm around him and was next to him?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall Mr. Mesereau asking you that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you tell the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department about that incident?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you also tell the sheriff's department that there were two other incidents that you saw Mr. Jackson on the bed with your brother?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
The Court: The answer was in.
Mr. Sneddon: So you told them there were actually three incidents that occurred?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you told them that in the initial interview; isn't that correct?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you also testified to that at the grand jury, did you not?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: You testified to all three incidents?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: So there was two you saw on the stairs, and one you saw when you were in the bedroom?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to the time that you saw Mr. Jackson on the bed with your brother, okay?
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: And that you've described to the jury with Mr. Jackson's hand inside your brother's private parts, okay?
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you have any difficulty seeing what was going on?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you see their eyes?
Star Arvizo: A little bit, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you tell whether or not in the first incident, whether or not your brother's eyes were opened or closed?
Star Arvizo: His head was facing down, and I saw his eyes. They were closed.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to Mr. Jackson in the first incident, did you see whether his eyes were open or closed?
Star Arvizo: His eyes were closed.
Mr. Sneddon: And in the second — well, in the first incident, I think you indicated that you — well, let me just do it the other way. When you said that you had seen alcohol in Mr. Jackson's room before –
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: – on the first incident when you went up there and you saw Mr. Jackson on the bed next to your brother and your brother curled up, did you see alcohol on that occasion?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was it in the room?
Star Arvizo: It was the nightstand next to the bed.
Mr. Sneddon: On which side?
Star Arvizo: My brother's side.
Mr. Sneddon: So you had no difficulty seeing the alcohol on the nightstand?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you were asked by Mr. Mesereau to look at a section of the transcript during your grand jury testimony about whether you saw Mr. Jackson fiddling with your brother's shirts or otherwise touching him. Do you recall him asking you that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And then you were asked a question by Mr. Mesereau, where you said — there was a question, “He would be touching him a lot?” “Yeah ”. And then you said, “Not his genitals. Not his penis. I never saw that”. Okay?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What were you referring to in connection with that statement in relationship to the information you had just talked about?
Star Arvizo: I was talking about at the table.
Mr. Sneddon: At the what?
Star Arvizo: At the table.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that where that incident occurred?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: So you didn't see him touch your brother's privates or genitals at the table?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Star, is there any doubt in your mind as to what you saw with regard to your brother and the defendant while they were laying on the bed on the two occasions you testified to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Was it the truth?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: I have no further questions, Your Honor.
The Court: Recross?
Mr. Mesereau: Very briefly, Your Honor. If I may take a second.
The Court: Yes.
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:

The Court: Go ahead, Counsel.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Star, you said there were 17 stairs, right?
Star Arvizo: Give or take a few, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you count them?
Star Arvizo: Over time, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: What do you mean, “over time”?
Star Arvizo: We stood there for a long time.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, I'm asking you, did you count the stairs?
Star Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you come up with the number “17”?
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me?
Star Arvizo: Most stairs like that have 17 stairs.
Mr. Mesereau: Most stairs like that have 17 stairs?
Star Arvizo: Well, most stairways like that have 17 stairs.
Mr. Mesereau: How do you know that?
Star Arvizo: Because my house has 17 stairs.
Mr. Mesereau: Did someone from the prosecution team tell you there was 17 stairs?
Star Arvizo: No, they — no, I just knew there were 17 stairs.
Mr. Mesereau: Did someone from the sheriff's department tell you there were 17 stairs?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you actually count those stairs?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When?
Star Arvizo: I don't know the exact date. But I remember counting them.
Mr. Mesereau: When you were at Neverland?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what was the purpose for counting them?
Star Arvizo: I don't know. I do that at every house I go to with stairs. I just count the stairs.
Mr. Mesereau: So you're a compulsive stair-counter?
Star Arvizo: No. I just count the stairs.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that one of your hobbies also?
Star Arvizo: No, my other hobby's building airplanes, model airplanes.
Mr. Mesereau: In none of the police reports do you mention “17 stairs”, correct?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Before the grand jury, you never mentioned “17 stairs”, correct?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: But you're saying years ago, you counted 17 stairs, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes, I just remember the number.
Mr. Mesereau: You did it just for fun, right?
Star Arvizo: Yeah. Just happened to count them.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you gave an eight -feet figure. Remember that?
Star Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you figure out eight feet –
Star Arvizo: I don't know. It looked like eight feet, so I just said –
Mr. Mesereau: Did you measure that also?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You just kind of guessed?
Star Arvizo: Well, I don't know. Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Did the prosecutor ever tell you eight feet?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did any member of the sheriff's department ever tell you to say eight feet?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: How many stairs are there in the main house leading to the kids' room?
Star Arvizo: Let's see. Six — I don't know exactly how –
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't count them?
Star Arvizo: No. They're not in a straight line, so I didn't count them. (Laughter.)
Mr. Mesereau: So when you count stairs, you only do it when they're in a straight line?
Star Arvizo: When they're straight.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You didn't count those stairs, did you?
Star Arvizo: I did count those stairs.
Mr. Mesereau: You mentioned you some rode ATV's, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you and your brother used to ride – rode ATV's on the ranch, right?
Star Arvizo: Until someone got lost in the mountains, 22 so ….
Mr. Mesereau: You actually rode those ATV's into Los Olivos one day, didn't you?
Star Arvizo: We never left the ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: Huh?
Star Arvizo: We never left the ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you were caught in Los Olivos with them, weren't you?
Star Arvizo: By who?
Mr. Mesereau: By someone who works on the ranch.
Star Arvizo: No, it's not true.
Mr. Mesereau: Never went off the property on the ATV's?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never were caught by anybody?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you were not supposed to be in the kitchen cooking, correct?
Star Arvizo: The cooks encouraged me to cook.
Mr. Mesereau: You were confronted by Kiki one time about you were not supposed to be in the kitchen, right?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't recall that?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't recall threatening Kiki with a knife when she confronted you in the kitchen?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never happened?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, Prosecutor Sneddon asked you what you meant when you told the grand jury you hadn't seen Michael Jackson touch Gavin's genitals or penis. Do you remember that?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And your response to Mr. Sneddon was, “Well, I was just talking about the dinner table”, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How come you never mentioned “dinner table” to the grand jury when you made that statement?
Star Arvizo: I don't know if they asked me.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, let me just go through what you said.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay? “Q. What kind of things? “Fix his shirt. “Q. What else? “A. He looked like from — if you're standing in front of him, it looked like he's trying to fix his shirt. But it's hard to explain. But he would like fix it, like he would touch — well, it was weird. “Q. He would be touching him a lot? “A. Yeah. “Q. Not his genitals, not his penis? “A. I never saw that. But I saw it in the paper”.
Star Arvizo: I don't know what I meant by “paper”, but I was trying to say that I didn't see it that time.
Mr. Mesereau: But you never mentioned any kitchen table, right?
Star Arvizo: But it wasn't the kitchen table.
Mr. Mesereau: But you never mentioned any table at all, correct?
Star Arvizo: I know.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you come up with that explanation?
Mr. Sneddon: Object; argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you discuss with Prosecutor Sneddon that you were going to be asked that question?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever discussed the statement you made to the grand jury about not seeing genitals or penis; ever discuss that statement with Mr. Sneddon?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever discuss it with any prosecutor?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever discuss it with anyone in the sheriff's department?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't mention that kitchen table in this context anywhere in the police reports, do you?
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. Assumes facts not in evidence as to — I won't say anything.
The Court: I don't think he knows what's in the police reports, so –
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I'll rephrase it, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: In none of your police interviews do you ever make that statement and say, “I'm limiting this to what I saw at the kitchen table”, right?
Mr. Sneddon: That's what I'm objecting to. It assumes facts not in evidence as to the — I know you don't want me to speak, but –
The Court: I don't want you to speak.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Then –
The Court: I'll allow the question. I'll have it read back.
The Court Reporter: In none of your police interviews do you ever make that statement and say, “I'm limiting this to what I saw at the kitchen table”, right?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And in none of your police interviews do you limit that statement about not seeing genitals or penis touched to any table, right?
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Today is the first time you ever limited that statement to what you saw at a table, correct?
Star Arvizo: I don't — yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you've indicated the first time you ever discussed any alleged inappropriate touching by Michael Jackson was with Psychologist Stanley Katz, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you have admitted that you gave Stanley Katz a different description than you've given in this courtroom, right?
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, you never mentioned the third event that you've described today to Stanley Katz?
Star Arvizo: Because I might have forgot about it.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions.
The Court: Mr. Sneddon? 5

Mr. Sneddon: Jett?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you were growing up and you started school, do you remember what school you started at?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, like, I think the first school I went to is a school called Durphy. And then I went to a school called Norwood.
Mr. Sneddon: You got to lean into the mike.
Gavin Arvizo: I think the first school I went to was Durphy, and it was like when I was like four years old. And the teacher said I wasn't, like, old enough to go to school, and I had to go to kindergarten to another school when I was five, something like that.
Mr. Sneddon: When you were — like, say, from kindergarten through the third or fourth grade, where were you living?
Gavin Arvizo: I was living at my — first my grandmother's house, and then we moved to East L.A.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember the street in East L.A. that you moved to?
Gavin Arvizo: Soto.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you lived on Soto Street, who did you live with at that place, in the beginning?
Gavin Arvizo: I lived with my biological father David and my mom Janet.
Mr. Sneddon: And what about your brother and sister?
Gavin Arvizo: My brother Star, and my sister Davellin.
Mr. Sneddon: And can you describe to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what the inside of the place that you lived at on Soto Street was like?
Gavin Arvizo: It was like one room, and then we had like a kitchen, there was like a hallway kind of, and we had to put all our appliances and stuff in there. And we had one rest room, and one closet, so it was like a bachelor apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: And where did you sleep in that room?
Gavin Arvizo: We slept like — when you would open the door, there was — we would put our bunk beds right there. But then later we didn't have any more bunk beds, and then we all slept on one bed together.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the time that you were living on Soto Street in your — well, let me ask it this way: At some point did your father leave?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember that?
Gavin Arvizo: I was at my grandmother's house when it happened. But my mom told me that something happened where he wanted him to take — she wanted to take my — my sister and my brother to go to, like, a park or something, and he got angry and he left.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you ever see your father after that?
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: During the time that your mother and father lived together and you lived with your mother and your father – okay? –
Gavin Arvizo: Uh -huh.
Mr. Sneddon: – how would you describe the nature of their relationship?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, like, they would fight every day, about where we lived and, like, bills and whatever.
Mr. Sneddon: You got to lean in there.
Gavin Arvizo: They would fight about bills, and his family, and our family. Well, the — like my mom's mother and father, and their cousins and my — they would fight about his family; you know what I mean?
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever see any physical abuse?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: By whom?
Gavin Arvizo: My dad would hit my mom sometimes. Like I saw him one time grab a fire hydrant and my mom tripped over a cart — or those — it was like a black cart that was like about that tall.
Mr. Sneddon: What did you use the cart for?
Gavin Arvizo: Used it for grocery shopping. It broke really easy, though. And my mom tripped over it because my dad was about to hit her with a fire hydrant.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you mean — a fire hydrant; do you mean like –
Gavin Arvizo: It was a fire — oh, it was a fire hydrant about that big, about that tall. They had them in our apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Were you ever struck by your father?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: How many times were you struck?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, I was not hit as much as my mom was, but I got hit sometimes.
Mr. Sneddon: How about your brothers and sisters?
Gavin Arvizo: I saw him hit my brother a lot, like in his head. He — and my sister sometimes, too, he slapped her.
Mr. Sneddon: During the summer one time, did you ever attend a comedy camp?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury about that.
Gavin Arvizo: When I was — when I was eight years old, my mom found this flyer, and she always thought that I was, like, kind of funny. So she wanted me to go to this comedy camp that was at a comedy club, and it was called Laugh Factory. And so I went there, and we would — Jamie would have comedians come, and then we would — they would teach us and we would take notes and stuff. And then, like, toward the end — well, when we have our graduation from comedy camp, we each had like a — like our own coach for each people — for each person, and my coach was George Lopez.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you used the name “Jamie ”. Do you know Jamie's last name?
Gavin Arvizo: Masada.
Mr. Sneddon: And did he become a family friend?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. He's really close. Like when I had cancer, he would always visit me. And he would feed me food, because I didn't really want to eat, because the chemotherapy makes you always nauseous and always want to throw up. And it got to the point where I got to, like, 68 pounds. And Jamie would feed me pineapple and melon and stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you were at the comedy camp that summer – okay? – did you have somebody that you admired as a comedian?
Gavin Arvizo: Uh -huh.
Mr. Sneddon: Who was that?
Gavin Arvizo: Jay Leno.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you ever talk to anybody about Jay Leno?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Who? Just tell me who first.
Gavin Arvizo: Jamie.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Go ahead.
Gavin Arvizo: At the comedy camp, I would always ask Jamie if Jay Leno was ever going to come, if Jay Leno's going to come and teach us, come to the camp, because I really liked him. Jay Leno was my favorite comedian. But he never came to the camp.
Mr. Sneddon: At some point in time, you learned — you became ill, correct?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you became ill, what was the first thing that you realized that something wasn't right with your body?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, my stomach was hurting a lot, like it felt like there was a knife in your stomach. And I couldn't sleep at night. I would put my pillow in my stomach, because it really hurt. And then I looked at myself in the mirror and lifted up my shirt, and I saw there was a big bump, like my lower left torso.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Gavin Arvizo: And my grandmother came, and she saw it, and she told my parents. And a couple days later we went to the hospital, and they told me — the doctors were saying, like, it's an inflamed spleen or it's this and that. They weren't really saying it was cancer yet.
Mr. Sneddon: When you went to the hospital for the first time and they examined you, did they put you in the hospital on that date?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. And then I had a surgery that same week on Thursday. So we went there on Monday, I think, and then surgery was on Thursday.
Mr. Sneddon: When did you personally learn that you had cancer?
Gavin Arvizo: Um, it was before my surgery. They were very open. They would — didn't try to hide it from me that I had cancer. The surgeons came in and they talked about it, and they said what the cancer was. And they said how they were going to take it out, and they were going to need to take out this – they're going to need to remove the cancer. And then Thursday they did the surgery. And they had – they didn't just have to take out the cancer, they had to take out my spleen and my left kidney, because the cancer was eating away at the — my spleen and my kidney.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, after you came out of surgery, and you — did you remain in the hospital for some period of time?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: How long; do you remember?
Gavin Arvizo: A few weeks, I guess.
Mr. Sneddon: During that first period of time after the surgery and you were there for two weeks, did you have any visitors?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Who was that?
Gavin Arvizo: Like my old coach, George Lopez, came, and he would always — he visited me. Jamie would visit me. And then Louise Palanker would visit me. My grandparents would visit me a lot. George Lopez would always bring me shirts and stuff, because a lot of my clothes didn't fit me anymore. And Jamie would buy me these little toys that I could play with. Jamie would always say like — I remember hearing him say to my parents actually, to “Always keep him happy. Always keep him happy ”.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you become friends with George Lopez?
Gavin Arvizo: Oh, yeah. He was like a brother to me. He was very close and caring about everything that happened with my cancer.
Mr. Sneddon: Are you still close to Mr. Lopez?
Gavin Arvizo: No. Not really.
Mr. Sneddon: What happened?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, I heard about something that happened between my biological father and George Lopez. There was a confrontation where he went to one of his clubs — not one of his clubs. One of his shows at a club, and –
Mr. Sneddon: Between your — between who?
Gavin Arvizo: My biological father David and George.
Mr. Sneddon: After that, did you have any contact with Mr. Lopez?
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Was that after your cancer had gone into remission?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes, I believe so.
Mr. Sneddon: So Mr. Lopez was there for you during the time you were having cancer?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, he was always there for me. He would always call and talk to me, call me and say that to “Always” — that “Always be happy”. He'd cheer me up when I was sad and stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the time that you were in the hospital with cancer, did you ever have a conversation with regard to some people that you would like to meet?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at the time that you asked — you made the request to meet these people, what was your condition at that point in time in terms of whether you thought you were going to live or die?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, me, when I had cancer, I never thought I was going to die. I always — I never even thought about that. I always thought about, oh, getting done with the chemo and going to school again; you know what I mean?
Mr. Sneddon: Did the doctors tell you something different?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, there was one time that I was — well, they thought I was sleeping in my bed, and they were talking to my mother and my biological father. And my doctor told them to prepare for my funeral. And that if the cancer didn't kill me, the chemotherapy would. Because the chemotherapy is toxic and they were giving me adult dosages.
Mr. Sneddon: So who did you make the request of to meet some people while you were under going cancer treatment?
Gavin Arvizo: Jamie.
Mr. Sneddon: And who did you ask to see?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, there's — I asked — like every time I would watch Jay Leno's shows was — Jay Leno was a really nice, really nice comedian, and I always wanted to meet him. And he was like — I thought he was like the coolest comedian. And then Louise Palanker and Jamie Masada knew that, and so they gave me his phone number. And I would call him up, and I would ask him if he could come and visit me or he could give me his phone number so I could call him, and I would leave messages.
Mr. Sneddon: Anybody else other than Mr. Leno?
Gavin Arvizo: Michael.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Anybody else?
Gavin Arvizo: Chris Tucker.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Were there any others? Were there others that you asked to meet but you didn't meet?
Gavin Arvizo: Oh, that I didn't meet? No, I don't think so.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Tell me about Mr. Tucker. How was it that you met Mr. Tucker?
Gavin Arvizo: He came to my first benefit that Jamie allowed me to have. And he was sitting there and talking to me, and he was talking to me about God and stuff, and that God's going to bless me and all this stuff like that. And then he wrote his phone number down on a napkin. He told me to call him and that we would hang out sometime. And then so — the next day I called him because I was — because it was Chris Tucker and he was really cool.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Did he come over?
Gavin Arvizo: I went over to his house.
Mr. Sneddon: How did you get there?
Gavin Arvizo: I think my dad drove me over the first time.
Mr. Sneddon: So you met Mr. Tucker at his house, the first time you met him in person?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. No, I met him in person the first time at the benefit. Like he was there. He was – he was wearing like this white hat and white shirt.
Mr. Sneddon: During the time that you had cancer, did you become close friends with Mr. Tucker?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. He is –
Mr. Sneddon: Tell us what Mr. Tucker did to help you.
Gavin Arvizo: He was really close to me. Like, he would always — like, he took us to the Nickelodeon Awards like two years in a row. And he said, “Well, this is our tradition. We're always going to go to the Nickelodeon Awards”. And he got really — like, we were really close. And, like, one night, on New Year's, I was feeling really sad because I had to be in the hospital, and I was watching the New Year's stuff. And so I called up Chris, and I asked him, “Hey” — I actually — I just left a message. I didn't really talk to him in person. I said, “Chris, man, I need my brother. I don't really have anybody here”. And then he didn't even — he didn't call me back. But like at twelve o'clock midnight, he was at my hospital — well, actually, he was in the elevator coming up to my hospital room as New Year's rang out. And then he came up there, and we were like — I was all, “Oh, Chris ”. And he brought Azja, his girlfriend, and little Dustin, his baby. And then I didn't think they were going to come because New Year's already rang out and stuff. Like, ten – seven — five seconds after New Year's, he was in my hospital room. And I was really happy, and — I don't know. And he said, “Well, it's not about looking at when it rings out. It's about being with the people you love”. And that's one of the reasons I really like Chris and I got close to Chris.
Mr. Sneddon: Did Mr. Tucker take you any other places?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, he took me to Neverland a couple of times. He took me out there.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Any other places that you recall going with Mr. Tucker?
Gavin Arvizo: Oakland.
Mr. Sneddon: Oakland?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. To see –
Mr. Sneddon: What was the occasion?
Gavin Arvizo: Oh, because he knew I liked the Raiders football team, so he — he knew this guy, he knew one guy on the football team. I don't know his first name, but his last name is Pope. And he took me up there in his plane, and then we went and saw an Oakland Raider game. And I remember the Raiders played the Jets. And then the Raiders won that game. And we went into the locker room afterwards. I met a bunch of players and he signed a jersey that I had. So it was pretty cool.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever go to any Laker games with him?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Tell us about that.
Gavin Arvizo: Like, he had these — like, these pretty rich friends, and he would take me to — over there, and he would always have, like, front-row seats to the Laker games, and they would take me. And then, like, Chris — one time Chris bought me a jersey, and we would always have those — like, I remember seeing — always go right when we come in, and it was the front-row seats so you could see the line of the court. It was pretty cool.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever go in the locker room?
Gavin Arvizo: No. We went — it wasn't really a locker room we went to. It was like — kind of like a garage place, and then we saw, like, all the players. They were already like dressed, leaving. And then I saw Shaq. Like, his whole — it was like my head came barely past his waist.
Mr. Sneddon: Big guy, huh?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Are you friends with Mr. Tucker anymore currently?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, I don't know if he still wants to be my friend, but I'm — no, I haven't called him in a while. And he hasn't — he hasn't called me and we haven't really talked in a while.
Mr. Sneddon: Why?
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know. I guess because of all this stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you told the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that you had gone to a benefit. I think that's what you said. A benefit?
Gavin Arvizo: Uh -huh.
Mr. Sneddon: At The Laugh Factory?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. Jamie donated one of his nights to – for me. I think it was like Thursday or something.
Mr. Sneddon: And was that a different night or the same night that you met Mr. Tucker for the first time?
Gavin Arvizo: I think that was the — the first night I met him was — oh, actually, when I met Chris Tucker, I met him at a graduation for the 2000 class of comedy camp. Like, Jamie invited me over there for that, and Chris Tucker was there. That wasn't when the benefit was. I just remembered that right now. It was then.
Mr. Sneddon: But did you meet him at a benefit?
Gavin Arvizo: I met Chris at the graduation for, like, 2000 comedy camp.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Do you know whether Mr. Tucker ever attended any of the benefits that Mr. Masada arranged?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, he came to my first benefit.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, were you at the benefit?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes. I performed in it.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, who else was there, from your family?
Gavin Arvizo: I had my doctor, my — Chris and his — all his friends. And Kobe was there. And he brought his girlfriend or his now wife. I don't know, some — it was a lady. Louise Palanker was there. A lot of people came, so….
Mr. Sneddon: And members of your family. Who was there?
Gavin Arvizo: My mom was there, and my biological father. Oh, I don't know if my mom was there. My biological father was there, I think.
Mr. Sneddon: Any of your brothers or sisters?
Gavin Arvizo: I'm pretty sure they were there.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you have occasion on that particular night to meet Kobe Bryant?
Gavin Arvizo: No. The first time I really met — I met Kobe Bryant was at one of the Laker games that Chris brought me. And they were all talking, like, in this hallway. It was — I don't know, it was like — it was like a really long hallway. It was all cement. And then Chris and, like, all these other guys were talking to Kobe and they were all leaning against the wall and they were all talking, and I was just sitting there because I was bored. They were all talking about, like, adult stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever have a picture taken with Mr. Bryant?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Where was that picture taken at?
Gavin Arvizo: That was at my first benefit.
Mr. Sneddon: At where?
Gavin Arvizo: At The Laugh Factory.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at any of these benefits — there were two benefits; is that correct?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: I don't want to put words in your mouth. Were there more than two, or is that –
Gavin Arvizo: No, I'm pretty sure there was only two.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was the second benefit?
Gavin Arvizo: At The Laugh Factory.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember how much time elapsed between the first benefit and the second benefit?
Gavin Arvizo: Probably a month maybe.
Mr. Sneddon: At the first benefit — or at the second benefit — let's just go to the second benefit for a second. Just tell me what members of your family were at that benefit.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know. Maybe — I guess my dad would be there.
Mr. Sneddon: Why?
Gavin Arvizo: Because he was the one that was always with me.
Mr. Sneddon: At either of these benefits, did you ever hear your mother ask for any money?
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever hear your father ask for any money at these benefits?
Gavin Arvizo: I wouldn't really see him asking for money, but I knew he would be the one getting the money.
Mr. Sneddon: How do you know that?
Gavin Arvizo: Because he would be the one talking to Jamie about that stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: During the time that you had cancer, was it necessary for the members of your family to do something to — with regard to where you stayed when you were not in the hospital?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: What was that?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, they didn't want me to stay at the apartment anymore. And they wanted to also make me happy, and they knew I loved my grandma, so they had me go live with my grandma. But the problem was, I couldn't go to my grandma's house, because they didn't have a room that I could stay in that was clean, because I had to stay in a clean room. So Louise Palanker gave us some money so that we could fix up a room at my grandma's house. And they gave us money so I could get, like, a – linoleum tile floors, and — because I couldn't have carpe t because it would be too dust y and bacteria could be there. And I didn't have a spleen, and I had, like, no white blood cells, so I could get sick, really sick, and get fevers and have to go to the hospital and stuff. That's why they had to put down linoleum floors. And then they painted the rooms all, like, this green color. And then they painted white because it was a different color. They got me a better bed and then they also found me a T.V. in my room.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember, how big was the T.V.?
Gavin Arvizo: It was probably about that big (indicating).
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. I'm a bad judge of distance there. About three feet?
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Sneddon: Counsel, three feet?
Mr. Sneddon: Depending whether they're Shaq's or not, I guess, huh? Okay. That's good. All right. I'm going to show you some photographs.
Gavin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Hang on a second. Could we have the lights, Your Honor?
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Gavin, do you recognize the people depicted in that photograph?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury — and what the number is on that photograph?
Gavin Arvizo: It was like four numbers. Exhibit number?
Mr. Sneddon: Yes.
Gavin Arvizo: 49.
Mr. Sneddon: 49. Okay. People's 49 in evidence. Who are those people?
Gavin Arvizo: All the way to the right is my little brother Star. And then that lady right there is Louise Palanker. And then that's my sister to the right of Louise Palanker. And then that's me.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recall when that photograph was taken?
Gavin Arvizo: That was during our camp at Laugh Factory.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know where the money came from to fix up your room?
Gavin Arvizo: I think it came from Louise.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you have a nickname you used to call her?
Gavin Arvizo: Wheezy. Wheezy.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Why don't you turn that photograph over. And I think the next one is 199; is that correct?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Do you recognize that photograph?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that you in that photograph?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall where you were when that was taken?
Gavin Arvizo: I believe that was in my first benefit. And then at The Laugh Factory.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Why don't we turn over — let's go to the next photograph, if we could. Do you recognize that?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And the number on that photograph is — look on the exhibit, if you would. 26 A. 337.
Mr. Sneddon: 337. Okay. Do you recognize that person?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, that's me.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was this taken, this photograph?
Gavin Arvizo: This is in a room that Louise got me, the room that Louise paid for so that I could have it.
Mr. Sneddon: This is what it looked like after they fixed it up?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Thanks, Gavin.
Gavin Arvizo: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. We can turn the lights back on, Your Honor. Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: Gavin, at some point in time, did you have some contact with the defendant in this case, Mr. Jackson?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury how that happened?
Gavin Arvizo: I'm not sure who exactly got Michael to call me. But he — one night — it was either Jamie or this lady named Carol LaMere. One day when I was in the hospital, Michael called me up — well, someone called me up, and I was like, “Who is this?”
Mr. Sneddon: Lean into the microphone, please.
Gavin Arvizo: Someone called me in my hospital room, and I asked who was this? And then they said they were Michael Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you believe them?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And how long did the conversation last?
Gavin Arvizo: That was a pretty short conversation. It was only about, like, five minutes long.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you have other conversations with Mr. Jackson?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: How many do you think you had — let me ask you this. Let's do it this way: At some point in time, were you invited to go to Mr. Jackson's ranch at Neverland Valley Ranch?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Between the time you received the first telephone call from the person identifying themselves as Michael Jackson until you went to the ranch, how many calls did you think you had between you and Mr. Jackson?
Gavin Arvizo: That was — there was only one call, because the first time that he called me, he invited me up to the ranch, said he wanted me to come down.
Mr. Sneddon: Were you undergoing chemotherapy at this time?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes, I was in the middle of a round of chemotherapy.
Mr. Sneddon: During this conversation with Mr. Jackson, was a date set for you folks to go there, or how was it that the date was set for you to go?
Gavin Arvizo: He just said that he wanted me to come down. And then I'm not sure how it got set up, but he was telling me like — about, like, my cancer, and talked to me about — that he wanted me to go to his ranch and stuff like that. I don't know how it got set up to go up there. I think they talked to my parents or something.
Mr. Sneddon: During the time that you had cancer, did you have other telephone calls with Mr. Jackson?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you give us an estimate of how many calls that you had from him?
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know. Like 20 maybe. 20 calls.
Mr. Sneddon: Were some of them quite lengthy?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Were they all in the hospital?
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Where were you when you had other calls with Mr. Jackson?
Gavin Arvizo: My grandma's house.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you said that you were invited by Mr. Jackson to go up to his ranch?
Gavin Arvizo: Uh -huh.
Mr. Sneddon: And had you ever heard of Mr. Jackson's ranch prior to that?
Gavin Arvizo: No. After when he, like, called me and said “ranch”, I thought it was like a ranch with horses.
Mr. Sneddon: So how did you get up to the ranch?
Gavin Arvizo: There was a limousine that came to my grandma's house and then we went up in a limousine.
Mr. Sneddon: And who went up there?
Gavin Arvizo: It was me, my mom, my biological father, my sister, my brother and me.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember about — like, was it daylight or was it dark when you got there?
Gavin Arvizo: It was daylight.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember what happened when you first got there?
Gavin Arvizo: Um, yeah, I think — I guess they told Michael we were up there already. And he had a bib on, because he was eating. And then he ran out and he greeted us and he had, like, a red shirt on, a black tie.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Did you have any conversation with Mr. Jackson at that time, during the greetings?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, he just said hi to us, because he had to go do something.
Mr. Sneddon: So where did you go after Mr. Jackson went to do something?
Gavin Arvizo: I think we ate.
Mr. Sneddon: All right.
Gavin Arvizo: I guess.
Mr. Sneddon: What did you do after that?
Gavin Arvizo: We went and saw the unit that he put us in. And then they were afraid — like, my dad was kind of afraid of putting me on rides, because he thought maybe, because of my surgery, I might, like, rupture something or whatever. And then — but I eventually talked him into letting me go on rides, and we started going on rides and stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: At the amusement park?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, at the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, let's go back just a moment. Okay? You said that you were placed in some room somewhere to stay. Where — where were those located in relationship to the main residence?
Gavin Arvizo: They were like 50, 100 yards away from the main house, and that's where they put, like, all our bags and stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: All the what?
Gavin Arvizo: All our bags. All in the place where we were staying. They put all our bags in those rooms.
Mr. Sneddon: The room that you stayed in, who stayed in that room with you?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, the first night I didn't really stay in that room. But the person that was supposed to stay in that room was me and my brother.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was your mother and your sister?
Gavin Arvizo: My mother, my sister stood in the guest – a queen-sized room or something. No, I think me, my brother, and my sister was going to stay in one room, and then my mom and my biological father were going to stay in another.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember any incident while you were at Neverland Ranch on this first visit involving your mother and your father?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: What happened?
Gavin Arvizo: They kind of got in a fight again, and my mom had makeup on and my dad made fun of her and said she looked like a clown, and then my dad got a cup of soda and threw it in her face.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, after you got to Neverland Ranch, before we go to the next day or to that night, did you ever ride any of the carts, the motorized carts there?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Tell us about that.
Gavin Arvizo: Well, I couldn't really ride one yet because Michael said, like, I had to go through his driving test to see if I could drive the carts. And then I could drive them. So –
Mr. Sneddon: What did the test amount to?
Gavin Arvizo: Just make sure I wouldn't crash it; I knew how to, like, drive it and not run into things.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you — did you ride in one of those carts?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Was somebody with you?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, when — like, riding — those times when I was riding it?
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
Gavin Arvizo: What do you mean? That one time?
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah, in the beginning.
Gavin Arvizo: I had to take his test first. So Michael was in the car with me. And it was in his cart, like a black one with doors and, like, it's all covered up.
Mr. Sneddon: And what about your brother, Star?
Gavin Arvizo: I didn't really see when he got his test, but my brother would ride in one, too.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. When you were at Neverland Ranch, was there ever an occasion where you slept in Mr. Jackson's room with Mr. Jackson?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury how it came about that you ended up sleeping with Mr. Jackson in his bedroom?
Gavin Arvizo: I think we were in his office. We were all talking.
Mr. Sneddon: Who's “we”?
Gavin Arvizo: Me, my brother and Michael. We were all in his office, and we were talking. And then Michael said we should sleep in his room. And then I was like — I was, like, “Okay, yeah”, because we were, like, wanted to sleep in his room, too. And then he told us to ask in front of our parents if we could sleep in his room. So I think it was like at dinner, we had asked her — we asked our parents if we could sleep in Michael's room, and then so we did. And then my parents said yeah, it was okay.
Mr. Sneddon: So when you say “we”, who else went with you?
Gavin Arvizo: My brother.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at some point that night, then, you go into Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What were you doing in there; do you recall?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, it started out, like, we were going to watch some Disney cartoons, and a bunch of these videotapes of the Simpsons. And then Frank had – Frank Tyson had a computer — I don't remember whether it was my computer or his computer — in there.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Tell us what happened.
Gavin Arvizo: And then he set up the computer. And then Frank started doing this — doing stuff on the Internet. And then they started looking up, like, adult material sites.
Mr. Sneddon: Where — was Mr. Jackson there?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Was Mr. Jackson involved in that?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And in what way?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, we were — he was, like, pointing out girls. Like, “Oh, I like her ”. And then — but, I mean, he wasn't typing. Frank was typing.
Mr. Sneddon: So how long do you think — how many different sites do you think you went to?
Gavin Arvizo: Maybe, like, seven sites. We didn't go to that many sites.
Mr. Sneddon: And how long do you think you were doing this?
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know. Maybe, like, 15, 30 minutes. Something like that.
Mr. Sneddon: I couldn't hear you.
Gavin Arvizo: I think maybe, like, 15, 30 minutes or something.
Mr. Sneddon: And you described it as adult materials. Can you tell us whether it was male or female?
Gavin Arvizo: It was female.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you tell us about the age — in your estimation, the age of the females that you saw?
Gavin Arvizo: Maybe, like, 15 to, like, 25 years old.
Mr. Sneddon: So between that range?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the time that you were on the – you were seeing the – The bailiff tells me that I'm to ask you to scoot closer to the microphone. And we all do what the bailiff says. Okay?
Gavin Arvizo: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: So lean into it and talk into it just like I am. Okay?
Gavin Arvizo: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: Perfect. Now, during the time that you were in the room going through these sites on the computer, did Mr. Jackson say anything?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Tell the jury what he said.
Gavin Arvizo: Like one time we were, like, looking at the site, and there was this girl with her shirt up. And Michael says — like, it was all quiet and stuff, and Michael was like, “Got milk ?” And we started laughing because he said that.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Did he say anything else?
Gavin Arvizo: Like, Paris and Prince were sleeping in his bed. And then Michael leaned over to Prince in his ear and he said, “Prince, you're missing all the 14 p-u-s-s-y”.
Mr. Sneddon: Did he spell it?
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: During the time that you became acquainted with Mr. Jackson, did you have a nickname that he used?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, it wasn't really a nickname just for me. Like, he would call all the kids that came to his ranch that. It was either like “Doo-Doo Head” or “Apple Head ”.
Mr. Sneddon: So he would call you either one of those two things?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recall whether he had a nickname for your brother?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. Like, we were trying to make up nicknames one time. He has a video library. And then we made up one for my brother, “Blow Hole”.
Mr. Sneddon: Did your sister Davellin have a nickname?
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: After you visited the ranch on the occasion that you described — just described to us – okay? - did you go back to the ranch?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you go back to the ranch?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Who did you go back with?
Gavin Arvizo: My biological father.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recall how many times you went back?
Gavin Arvizo: Maybe, like, seven, ten times, something like that. I mean –
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember a time when you went back to the ranch and there was a video taken of you and Star with Mr. Jackson?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recall on that particular occasion when the video was made, like how many – where on these trips was that? In the beginning, the middle or the end? Where was it?
Gavin Arvizo: It was really toward the beginning.
Mr. Sneddon: And did your mother go with you on any of those trips?
Gavin Arvizo: No. I think she, like, didn't come with me after the first time.
Mr. Sneddon: How about your sister?
Gavin Arvizo: I don't think she did either, because she was at school. Between that and to Miami, or –
Mr. Sneddon: Yes.
Gavin Arvizo: – when I had cancer?
Mr. Sneddon: Yes, between that and Miami.
Gavin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Was there — let me put it this way: Was there a time when you went back to the ranch with Chris Tucker?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. So let's just use that as a point in time. All right?
Gavin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: From the time you went there for the very first time with your whole family, when Mr. Jackson invited you, to the time when you went back with Mr. Tucker – okay? – for the first time?
Gavin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: How many times had you visited the ranch?
Gavin Arvizo: Maybe, like, seven times probably.
Mr. Sneddon: And during those times — during that period of time, was your mother ever with you, other than the first time?
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: How about your sister?
Gavin Arvizo: No, I don't think so.
Mr. Sneddon: The video that shows you and Mr. Jackson and your brother Star, when you're wheeled around in the wheelchair –
Gavin Arvizo: Uh -huh.
Mr. Sneddon: – did anybody tell you why they were doing that?
Gavin Arvizo: No. Michael just said he wanted to make a video and keep it, of me and him.
Mr. Sneddon: During the time from when — the first time you went to the ranch that you've described to us to the time that you went there with Mr. Tucker - okay? – during that, I think you said seven times, how many of those times was Mr. Jackson actually present on the ranch?
Gavin Arvizo: Maybe twice.
Mr. Sneddon: And on those occasions when Mr. Jackson was on the ranch, did you have any contact with him?
Gavin Arvizo: Those two occasions, yeah. But, I mean, like, sometimes I would go up to the ranch and he would say that he's not there, and then he would be there.
Mr. Sneddon: What do you mean by that?
Gavin Arvizo: Like, when I would have cancer. I don't know what happened, but Michael, like, kind of stopped talking to me and stuff, right in the middle of my cancer. And, like, I would go up there, and I would see, like, Prince and Paris playing there, and I would think that Michael was there, and they would tell me that Michael wasn't there. And then, like, I would see him somewhere, and — I don't know.
Mr. Sneddon: Was there one occasion when you actually ran into him by accident?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Tell the jury about that.
Gavin Arvizo: Well, I was playing with Prince and Paris outside, like in the back of the house near where the arcade was. And then we were walking into the — into the main house. And I knew the code, because they would give me the codes. And then I walked in the door with Prince in my hand and Paris in my other hand, and — we were holding hands. And then we walked into the house and there I saw Michael walking, like, toward me. But I guess he didn't see me turn the corner. And then he acted as if, “Oh, crap”, you know what I mean? Like, he saw me. And then — then he just played it off and, like, acted like, “Oh, hi, Doo-Doo Head”. You know, at the time I — I was kind of hypnotized and, like, he's my –
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; calls for a narrative and non responsive.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Gavin Arvizo: And then, like –
Mr. Sneddon: That's all right. I'll give you a question. So in any case, you bumped into him?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. And I was — because of –
Mr. Sneddon: That's okay. How much more contact did you have with him on that time when you bumped into him? How much time did the contact last?
Gavin Arvizo: I didn't really see him through my cancer a lot.
Mr. Sneddon: I mean, you told the ladies and gentlemen of the jury there was an occasion where you were there when you kind of bumped into him by accident?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: When you actually made contact with him - okay? – how long did that last? Just — how long was the conversation between the two of you?
Gavin Arvizo: Maybe, like, five minutes. When — that time we bumped into each other, and then we just talked about — and stuff, and he said he had to go somewhere.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you mentioned that you — well, let me ask you this: Did you ever have a phone number for Mr. Jackson?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. He gave me a lot of phone numbers.
Mr. Sneddon: I couldn't hear you.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And how did you get those phone numbers?
Gavin Arvizo: Michael would give them to me, or Frank would sometimes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when did you get those phone numbers?
Gavin Arvizo: Toward the beginning.
Mr. Sneddon: Beginning of what?
Gavin Arvizo: Like, the beginning of my cancer. First or second time we went up to the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: Was there a certain point in time when those phone numbers weren't working anymore?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. Like –
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember how long it was into your cancer when those phone numbers were no longer good?
Gavin Arvizo: Maybe, like, halfway through. Like, it seemed like he changed all his numbers, or the numbers that I called, he wouldn't pick up. And – or, like, Frank's cell phone wasn't — he wouldn't pick up. Frank wouldn't pick up his phone either. And –
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you told the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that there was a time that you went back to the ranch with Mr. Tucker. Do you remember that? Do you remember when you went?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Tell the jury when it was you went.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know. It was for his little son's — Dustin's birthday.
Mr. Sneddon: And who went with you?
Gavin Arvizo: Me, my now dad Jay, and I think my mom went, and my brother and my sister, and they had his birthday party there.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there other times that you spent on the ranch with Mr. Tucker?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And how long do you think you were there with Mr. Tucker?
Gavin Arvizo: For — with Dustin's party?
Mr. Sneddon: Yes.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know. It was just a day thing. We went up there for one day and then we came back.
Mr. Sneddon: You came what?
Gavin Arvizo: I think we just went there for that and then came back home.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there other occasions when you were up there with Mr. Tucker?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, one other time.
Mr. Sneddon: And how long did you stay on that occasion?
Gavin Arvizo: We stood there for, like, a few — like a week or — maybe a week and a half, something like that.
Mr. Sneddon: Was Mr. Jackson there on the day of Mr. Tucker's son's birthday?
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you went back and stayed for about a week or a week and a half, was Mr. Jackson there?
Gavin Arvizo: With Chris?
Mr. Sneddon: Yes.
Gavin Arvizo: He was there, like, for a few days. That was when — I believe that was when the Martin Bashir thing happened.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry?
Gavin Arvizo: I believe that was when the Martin Bashir thing happened.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Let's talk a little bit about Martin Bashir. Were you introduced to a person by the name of Martin Bashir?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And where were you introduced to the person by the name of Martin Bashir?
Gavin Arvizo: In Michael's living room, in his main house.
Mr. Sneddon: And who introduced you to Mr. Bashir?
Gavin Arvizo: Michael.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, how did you get to the ranch?
Gavin Arvizo: Um, I think Chris drove me up that time. And then — in his bus.
Mr. Sneddon: And did any other members of your family go with you?
Gavin Arvizo: It was only me, my sister and my brother.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you know why you were going to the ranch?
Gavin Arvizo: Michael wanted me to go up there, and then I think I called Chris. Because I would always tell him that we never went up there, like together. We'd never been at the ranch together with Chris. He would go up there one time, and I would be at home. And then I would go up, and he would be home. So we said that we'd all go there together. So we all went up there, and Chris took us up there.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you — when you got there — let me go back in point in time. Did you have a conversation with Mr. Jackson before you went up to the ranch for the Bashir thing – meaning Mr. Bashir – within, let's say, days of that?
Gavin Arvizo: Michael told me that he wanted me to go up to the ranch, but — that's when he wanted me to go with — well, that's when it was set up with Chris, but I mean before that, I didn't talk to him in a very, very long time.
Mr. Sneddon: So when you said Mr. Jackson told you he wanted you to go up to the ranch, how did that communication occur between you and Mr. Jackson?
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know. He called my house. And he kind of said he was trying to find me or something.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. So you go up to the ranch and you meet Mr. Bashir. When you got to the ranch, what was the first thing that happened?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, he put our bags away. And then I had — and I went into the main house. And – Michael took me to the main house.
Mr. Sneddon: Who did?
Gavin Arvizo: Michael.
Mr. Sneddon: The defendant?
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Gavin Arvizo: And then introduced me to Martin Bashir.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. What happened then?
Gavin Arvizo: He told me –
Mr. Sneddon: Who's “he”?
Gavin Arvizo: No, actually, I don't think that's the first thing that happened. I think — he started talking to me about what was going to happen and stuff. Like, he was pointing — he was telling me about another young man that was a burn victim. And he was telling me about how he helped him or whatever.
Mr. Sneddon: Who's this? Who's the “he”?
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Sneddon: No, who was talking to you?
Gavin Arvizo: Michael.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Gavin Arvizo: And then –
Mr. Sneddon: Where were you when you had this conversation?
Gavin Arvizo: I think we were driving in one of the carts. And then he was telling me that he was filming something or something like that.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Did — did you at some point go inside?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you have any other conversations with Mr. Jackson?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, that's when he introduced me to Martin Bashir.
Mr. Sneddon: Any other conversation with Mr. Jackson?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. Like, he introduced me to Martin Bashir, and then he took me — I think it was in the library where he took me. And then he was telling me, “Hey, you want to be an actor, right? And I was like, “Yeah. I want to be comedian though”. And then he was like, “But you can act too, right?” And then I was like, “Yeah”. “Well, I'm going to put you in the movies. And this is your audition. Okay ?” And I was like, “Oh, all right”. And he told me, “Okay. I want you to go in and then tell them about how I helped you ”. And he told me to, like, make sure — tell them about, like, this and that, and about “that you call me dad”, or “Daddy”, or –
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Nonresponsive; calls for a narrative.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, this is the conversation.
The Court: Well, it is narrative, though.
Mr. Sneddon: All right.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: Was there anything else said during the conversation?
Gavin Arvizo: He told me that he wanted me to say certain things on the videotape.
Mr. Sneddon: What did he tell you to say on the videotape?
Gavin Arvizo: He told me to say that he helped me, and that he — he pretty much cured me of cancer.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you do that?
Gavin Arvizo: Um –
Mr. Sneddon: On the video?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Was it true?
Gavin Arvizo: Not really, because he — during my cancer, he wasn't really even there. I mean, the real people — I mean, it's, like, the real people who were there were George Lopez, because he would always visit me in the hospital like every day, and he would bring me shirts and stuff. Chris Tucker would always visit me in the hospital. Louise Palanker would come and we'd make jokes because, like, I wasn't good at smelling stuff. Chemotherapy would clear out everything. And then Fritz Coleman, would always come with Louise and talk to me, and –
Mr. Sneddon: At this point in time, when you went up to the Bashir video –
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: – to the Bashir interview, okay? –
Gavin Arvizo: Uh -huh.
Mr. Sneddon: – did you have — did you admire Mr. Jackson?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. I was like –
Mr. Sneddon: What was your attitude towards Mr. Jackson at this point in time?
Gavin Arvizo: I thought, like, he was the coolest guy in the world. He was like my best friend ever. Do you know what I mean?
Mr. Sneddon: So you had a genuine affection for Mr. Jackson at this time?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, I really liked him. He was like — I don't know, he was just — like — I –
Mr. Sneddon: So during the course of the interview with Mr. Bashir – okay? – after that interview was completed, all right?
Gavin Arvizo: Uh -huh.
Mr. Sneddon: Tell us what happened after the interview was completed. Was there any other filming that went on that day?
Gavin Arvizo: No, I don't think so.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know whether or not your brother and sister ever got their picture taken in the filming?
Gavin Arvizo: Well, yeah. Well, there was one time that I saw on the tape that they filmed us. I didn't even know the camera was on. And they were inside of the kitchen and my sister and brother were there. And me and my brother were showing Michael a marching cadence from one of the programs that we were in that we had learned.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. What was — what was the — what was the marching cadence from, what program?
Gavin Arvizo: It's from a program called the United States Naval Sea Cadets.
Mr. Sneddon: And had you — what was the situation of you learning this cadence? Just part of the training?
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, it was part of the basic training that we went to.
Mr. Sneddon: How long was the basic training?
Gavin Arvizo: Two weeks ago.
Mr. Sneddon: Where was it?
Gavin Arvizo: He went to a Navy Leaguer boot camp, and it was for, like, younger kids. And then I went to a sea cadet boot camp. It's harder and it's for older kids.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you know at the time that Mr. Bashir was interviewing you with Mr. Jackson, the defendant in this case, did you know that that video was going to be shown around the world?
Gavin Arvizo: No, not at all. I thought it was another thing like — like he had filmed before, like him carrying me across the bridge, that video. I thought it was going to be another thing like that, like he was going to, like, put it away somewhere and keep it just for himself.
Mr. Sneddon: Had there been other instances on the ranch where you had been filmed with Mr. Jackson, other than the one with him carrying you across the bridge, and the one with Mr. Bashir, that you recall?
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, after the filming was over, do you recall seeing Mr. Jackson at all, after that?
Gavin Arvizo: After the film? After the Martin Bashir thing?
Mr. Sneddon: Yes.
Gavin Arvizo: Well, I think he left, like, the next day. And me and my brother and my sister, like, stood up there, and we were, like, swimming and stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you have any contact with Mr. Jackson after the filming?
Gavin Arvizo: No. Like, the same thing happened. Like, the phone number they gave me while I was up there wasn't working no more.
Mr. Sneddon: It's a bad question on my part. While you were at the ranch for the Mr. Bashir filming and after the filming was over with but before you and your brother or your sister left, did you have any contact with Mr. Jackson at all?
Gavin Arvizo: No. A day after the filming, he left the ranch and went somewhere.
Mr. Sneddon: So where did you spend the night after the Bashir film?
Gavin Arvizo: In our unit that they gave us.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, this would be a good place to stop. If you want me to go on –
The Court: All right. You know, I've decided that if I have to go to the rest room, I'm not going to say that. I'm going to say, “I have an important call ”. (Laughter.) See you tomorrow at 8:30.
Adjourn Message: The proceedings adjourned at 2:30 p.m.
