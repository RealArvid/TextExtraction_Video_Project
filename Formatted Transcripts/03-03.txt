Start of Day Message: Santa Maria, California Thursday, March 3, 2005 8:30 a.m.
The Court: Good morning.
Counsel At Counsel Table: (In unison) Good morning, Your Honor. Good morning, Your Honor.
The Jury: (In unison) Good morning.
The Court: I told you that when I knew that we were going to have a day that you weren't going to be here, I would let you know as soon as I could. And I'm going to do that right now.
Bailiff Cortez: I'm sorry, Judge, they can't hear you in the back, sir.
The Court: That's because my microphone's off. Next Friday, not this Friday, the 11th of March, the jury will not come in. We are going to have a day just of motions outside the presence of the jury. So we've set up a whole day to do that. And that will give you a nice break. In addition to that, on Tuesday, next week -- I don't have the date in front of me.
The Clerk: It would be the 8th.
The Court: The 8th, we're going to stop one hour early. And I have a meeting that afternoon, so we'll go to -- we'll probably go to close to 12:00 and then stop. So it's not a day off, but it's an afternoon off, I guess you'd say. All right. Those are the only times right now that I know that I can give to you. Let's see, where were you. Are you ready to proceed. Do you want me to show the screen now.
Mr. Sneddon: I have a few questions first, Your Honor. But we are going to use the DVD player, so we can alert the Court to that.
Message: ALBERT LAFFERTY Having been previously sworn, resumed the stand and testified further as follows:
Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION Continued BY MR. SNEDDON:
Mr. Sneddon: Good morning.
Albert Lafferty: Good morning.
Mr. Sneddon: Deputy Lafferty, you told the ladies and gentlemen of the jury yesterday that you were involved in the execution of the search warrant on Neverland Ranch on the 18th of November, 2003, correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what time was it when you arrived on the ranch that morning.
Albert Lafferty: I arrived on the ranch property at approximately 9:07 that morning.
Mr. Sneddon: And I think you told us yesterday one of your main responsibilities was to photograph the interior of the main residence; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: To videotape the --
Mr. Sneddon: Videotape.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you keep time -- track of the time in which you actually started your responsibilities of videotaping the inside of the residence.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you note that in a report.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: And what time was it that you started the video of the interior of the main residence at Neverland Valley Ranch.
Albert Lafferty: I would have to look on my report to find the exact --
Mr. Sneddon: Do you have it with you.
Albert Lafferty: I do have a copy of it.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Go ahead. See if that refreshes your recollection.
Albert Lafferty: At approximately 0955 hours I began the video of the main residence.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, later that same day, were you assigned responsibilities in connection with documenting the status of the inside of the interior when the sheriff's department left.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I was.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what your responsibilities were.
Albert Lafferty: It's basically the same as I had done the prewarrant service video. I retraced my steps the same way, going back through the residence, showing the condition of the residence after the search had been completed.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recall what time you started doing that particular video documentary.
Albert Lafferty: If I could refer to my report for --
Mr. Sneddon: Please. If you could.
Albert Lafferty: At approximately 8:40 p.m., I was told that the search had been completed in the main residence, with the exception of the master bedroom area, and I began the video of the residence at that time.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at some point that evening, did you actually go up and video-document the main bedroom.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: The defendant's bedroom.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: What time did that start.
Albert Lafferty: That was at approximately 10:38 p.m.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you have in your notes the time that you actually finished that project.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: What was that.
Albert Lafferty: That was at 10:55 p.m.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, after you left the defendant's bedroom, did you do any more video-documenting before you left the house.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what it was you did.
Albert Lafferty: Prior to leaving the residence, I went back into the dining room, I believe what would be the formal dining room area of the residence, and videotaped copies of the search warrant and the property, itemized list of the items that were taken from the residence during the search warrant. They were laid out on the dining room table and videoed the fact that they had been left at the residence.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there people actually present when you did that.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, there were.
Mr. Sneddon: Who was present, to your knowledge.
Albert Lafferty: I believe it was Sergeant Robel and Lieutenant Klapakis.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there any representatives of Mr. Jackson there.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, there were.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember her name, or their name.
Albert Lafferty: I believe her name was Violet. I don't recall the last name.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And then did you prepare a report documenting the times at which you performed the various functions you've told the ladies and gentlemen of the jury about.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: You incorporated that into an official Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department report.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to the film that you took on the occasion of the 18th, what did you do with that film.
Albert Lafferty: That evening, when I returned to the station, it was secured in a locked locker within our forensics unit property area. And then at a later date, it was booked into evidence.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I have an exhibit which I've had marked -- premarked, with the help of the court clerk, as 336. It's a DVD. And counsel has a copy of it, but -- may I approach the witness for just a second with this, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to stay here because I'm going to ask you a few questions and walk back. The particular exhibit marked as 336, the DVD inside of that container there, have you had an occasion to view that before you came to court.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Does that contain the product of your walk-through of the ranch on the 18th of November of 2003.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, it does.
Mr. Sneddon: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: Move that People's Exhibit 336 be admitted into evidence.
Mr. Sanger: No objection, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. It's admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I propose to play this for the jury now, with the Court's permission.
The Court: All right. How long is it.
Mr. Sneddon: It's, I would say, 12 minutes, something like that. Between ten and 12 minutes, Your Honor.
The Court: Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: And -- don't start it. With the Court's permission, we may stop it from time to time to ask the officer a comment on certain locations.
The Court: Of course.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you do that. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: Now, Deputy Lafferty, what is being depicted on the scene up there on the screen right now.
Albert Lafferty: This is the view from just outside the main entry door of the main residence on the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Go ahead. Your Honor, for purposes of the record, when we stop it, we have a recorder, we can reference the point on the tape for the Court for the record. Would that be appropriate.
The Court: You may do that.
Mr. Sneddon: This would be at 00.17. Thank you. Go ahead. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: Now, Detective Lafferty, do you recognize the area on the video where we've stopped it at this point.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: And what is that.
Albert Lafferty: This is just inside of the main door, looking to the right as you would face the door from the exterior. And it's a view looking down the hallway towards the master bedroom area.
Mr. Sneddon: This would be at 00.29. All right. Go ahead. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: Now, do you recognize what's at the still at this particular point on the documentary.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: What's that.
Albert Lafferty: This is an area that had a large number of items in reference to where it is in the residence. It's -- as you enter through the front door, if you would proceed straight through the foyer to that, and then turn to the left.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. That's at 00.39. Go ahead. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: Stop it right there.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, we're at a point on the video, which is 01.40. Can you tell us what this shows.
Albert Lafferty: This is the hallway leading from the foyer area towards the master bedroom.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you see in this photograph the master bedroom doors.
Albert Lafferty: There's a small portion of it visible, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you show that to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
Albert Lafferty: It's the dark brown door here to the -- to the right of the screen.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Go ahead. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: Stop.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, we're at 01.44. Could you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what's depicted here.
Albert Lafferty: This is a view looking down. It's just the inside of the door, the prior stop, the master bedroom door, just inside there.
Mr. Sneddon: So we're at the entrance of the master bedroom.
Albert Lafferty: Just inside of that, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Go ahead. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Stop.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Deputy Lafferty, we're at 02.19 on the video. What is depicted where we stopped it.
Albert Lafferty: This is a staircase leading up to the bed area and the master bedroom.
Mr. Sneddon: We're still inside the suite, the bedroom area.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Go ahead. Play it. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Go ahead. Keep going. All right. Stop it there.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, we're at a point on the video which is 03.07. Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury where you're located approximately in the bedroom at this point.
Albert Lafferty: This is just up at the top landing of the stairs starting to turn to the right.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Go ahead. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: Stop.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, we're at a point at four -- 04.48. Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury where we are in that particular portion of the house at this point in the video documentary.
Albert Lafferty: This is still in the master bedroom suite back down on the first level. Just inside, actually behind us, would be the main entry door, just starting to go towards the left.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Go ahead. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Deputy, could you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury where we are at this point.
Albert Lafferty: This is the doorway leading into the master bedroom/bath area.
Mr. Sneddon: And this is at 05.14. All right. Go ahead. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Stop it.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, where are we on the documentary at this point.
Albert Lafferty: This is just exiting the bathroom area back into a sitting area, which is the first room you come into as you enter the master bedroom suite.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. We're at 06.54. Go ahead. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: Stop.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, Deputy Lafferty, with regard to the documentation of the search of Neverland Valley Ranch on November 18th, did you also have other responsibilities after you had completed the video documentary.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: What was that.
Albert Lafferty: To assist Detective Clark in taking still photographs of items that was requested by the searching people at the location.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you describe to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury how that process worked.
Albert Lafferty: We stood by and the people who -- when the warrant was executed, there were different teams that were assigned to search various locations. When those people would conduct a search and find an item that they would like to have documented, they would contact us, and we would go and take still photographs of that item before it was collected.
Mr. Sneddon: When you say to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury “before it was collected”, does that mean where it is before it's either touched or picked up.
Albert Lafferty: To the best of our knowledge, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And then you would take a photograph of that.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to the area that we've just seen in the photograph that you've described as the master bedroom and the - the first floor and second floor, okay. - were you involved in photo-documenting the location of items that were taken from this particular area of the house.
Albert Lafferty: There were only a few items that I took photographs of. The majority of that was done by Detective Clark.
Mr. Sneddon: So there were two of you there doing that.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: But you were responsible for taking some of the photographs. All right. Go ahead. Move on. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: Let's stop right here. That's a good place right away. Do you recognize this room.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen what this room is, where it's located in the house generally.
Albert Lafferty: This room was a room that we refer to as the doll room. It consists of a lot of dolls in there. It's located on the second level of the main residence outside of the master suite. As you enter the end of the foyer, there was a staircase to the right-hand side as you followed the stairs up. When you reached the second story, you went to the left side, which the room is located on the -- what would be the northwest area of the floor.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Go ahead. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Stop.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, we've obviously moved into another room. And we've stopped it at 08.14. Could you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what this particular room is.
Albert Lafferty: This is a room that we referred to as the toy room. It is located off of what we referred to as the doll room. It would be on the west side of that location. As you went through shortly before this picture, you entered a rest room area, and would proceed to the right. It went through another door which led into this room.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Go ahead. (Whereupon, a portion of a DVD, People's Exhibit 336, was played for the Court.)
Mr. Sneddon: That's it. Don't go back.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. I just have one last final question. With regard to the video footage that we've just -- that the ladies and gentlemen of the jury have just seen, was that part of the footage from the -- when you first got there, or was that from the footage before you left that evening.
Albert Lafferty: This was the prewarrant service footage.
Mr. Sneddon: So it's the condition of the house as it was when you arrived there on the morning of the 13th of November of 2003.
Albert Lafferty: November the 18th.
Mr. Sneddon: Thank you. I just wanted to see if you were still awake. No further questions.
The Court: Cross-examine.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you, Your Honor.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: Is it Detective or Deputy.
Albert Lafferty: At the time that this was, I was a detective. I have since been reassigned and it's Deputy now.
Mr. Sanger: You prefer “Deputy”.
Albert Lafferty: That's fine.
Mr. Sanger: There you go. All right. Deputy Lafferty, why don't we just pick up where we left off - that's always a good place - and we'll go to some of the other areas. First of all, the video that we just saw -- and I'm going to go back over some of the parts again. But the video that we just saw, Exhibit 336, was taken on the day of the search of the ranch, correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And it was November the 18th, 2003; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Now, prior to that search, you were briefed along with quite a number of other officers about what was going to take place; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And you received a briefing outline, briefing memo of some sort; do you recall that.
Albert Lafferty: Not all of us were given that. But teams were assigned, and there was a packet given to each team leader.
Mr. Sanger: Did you get a packet.
Albert Lafferty: No, I did not.
Mr. Sanger: You were aware of the purpose of the search; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you were aware that this arose out of allegations by the Arvizo family; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: I do not know who the victim was.
Mr. Sanger: Do you recall that the allegations were with regard to activities that may or may not have occurred in February and March of 2003; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: I don't recall.
Mr. Sanger: All right. In any event, what you have shown here on the video is part of the tape that you did that day, right.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And the tape you did that day documents what the premises looked like on November 8 -- I'm sorry, November 18th, 2003, correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And it does not document how the premises looked in February or March of 2003.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, how many officers came out to the Neverland Valley location.
Albert Lafferty: I'm not aware of the total number.
Mr. Sanger: Was it about 45 or so.
Albert Lafferty: I don't know.
Mr. Sanger: You indicated that you arrived at the ranch at 9:07, and you started your video at 0955 hours; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: That's about the same time that Chris Pappas -- what's -- what's Mr. Pappas's rank.
Albert Lafferty: Sergeant.
Mr. Sanger: Sergeant. That's about the time that Sergeant Pappas issued a press release to the press; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: I don't know. I wasn't aware what time he did that.
Mr. Sanger: You were aware he did that, though, is that right.
Albert Lafferty: At some point during the day, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And the officers -- well, you don't know how many, but there were quite a number, were there not, sir.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, there were.
Mr. Sanger: You've been trained in the academy before you became a sheriff's deputy, correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And part of your training in the academy is to observe and document what you see at a scene; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And you were not responsible for counting the number of officers, I take it.
Albert Lafferty: No, I was not.
Mr. Sanger: But as a trained deputy, you can tell me generally how many people were out there, can't you. More than, say, 30.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And this was Mr. Jackson's home, that was your understanding; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And it's a home that he appeared to live in; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: With his family.
Albert Lafferty: It appeared so.
Mr. Sanger: And he had, at that time, and has three children; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: I believe so. I don't know the total number.
Mr. Sanger: When you went through the house, you saw that there were bedrooms for his three children; did you not.
Albert Lafferty: There were three bedrooms upstairs, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And they actually had name tags on the door, didn't they.
Albert Lafferty: There were tags on the doors, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And each of those bedrooms for the children had a key pad to keep people from coming in without a combination if the door was locked; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: I do recall seeing key pads on the doors.
Mr. Sanger: And Mr. Jackson's suite, the part that you showed on the video there, where you go through the double doors, had a key pad to restrict access; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: I believe so, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, we'll go back over it so everybody has a clearer picture, but just to do a word picture first, when you come into the house -- you showed some pictures. You come into the house, there's a -- what you might call a living room area; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: There's the foyer area where the stairs are. There's a hallway leading north from where the front door area is.
Mr. Sanger: And if you go north, there's an area that has a castle.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: But it also has chairs and a television set and clocks and that sort of thing; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: I don't recall any seating areas in the areas with the castle.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. We'll go back and look at the pictures again. But you also showed an area that had sort of a blue plaid -- or a sitting area with a fireplace or -- a fireplace; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: Right.
Mr. Sanger: And that's sort of a family room area; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, that's just off of the kitchen.
Mr. Sanger: That's off that big kitchen area that you showed with the copper hood and all that.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Next to that is a dining area; is that correct --
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- with a dining table. Something you didn't show on the video, if you were going to the right of what I'm calling the living room area, is a library; is that right. Do you remember that.
Albert Lafferty: Yes. If you walk through the foyer area, and go to the right, there was what appeared to be a library or a study area.
Mr. Sanger: So when you go into -- let me withdraw that. When you're in that part of the house that we've just described, that's all pretty open. In other words, you can walk freely from the back door through the kitchen, to the family area, the living room, the study, or library, the dining area, the front foyer and the front door, right.
Albert Lafferty: Right.
Mr. Sanger: Correct. The actual living areas for Mr. Jackson and his children are accessible by using the key pads; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: When I was in the residence, those doors were all open. But there were key pads next to the doors.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So to get to the children's room, you would go upstairs, off the foyer to the right, you'd go upstairs, and the children's rooms are all up in that area; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: That's the same place where you saw what you described as the doll room; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And the area you called the toy room, we might call it a craft room, but that's in the same area where the children's suite is; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And, in fact, above that -- you didn't show us a picture of this -- but above that or in that area is a classroom. Remember the classroom.
Albert Lafferty: There was another -- appeared to be another toy room. There were numerous toys, things in that area, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And there were little desks and sort of a little mini classroom, don't you -- do you recall that.
Albert Lafferty: There were a number of things in there. I don't specifically remember desks.
Mr. Sanger: Remember there was a train set.
Albert Lafferty: I do remember the train.
Mr. Sanger: In one end -- and if you go in the other end, there's a more open area. There may or may not have been desks there; is that what you're telling us.
Albert Lafferty: I don't specifically recall a desk. But --
Mr. Sanger: All right. Going back -- just doing this with a word picture so the film will make a little more sense, hopefully. When you -- if we go back to the front door, and instead of going up the stairs to the children's area we go to the right, there's a hallway. That I think you showed on there; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And that's where the double doors are to Mr. Jackson's private area; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And that's where he has a key pad, correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And inside of that area he has what you called a sitting room, but it's like a living room on the first floor; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: There's a grand piano.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: There are books.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Lots of books.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. There's a big screen T.V..
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And while you're in that first floor area, you showed us on the video something that you referred to as the bathroom; remember that.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And that had that Jacuzzi tub in there.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Now, if you walk through the door, and you do a right face, you would be facing that big screen T.V.. If you walk through the door, get in the middle of the room, do a right face, you're facing the big screen T.V., correct.
Albert Lafferty: It would be 90 degrees to the T.V.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Half right.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Do a half right face. Point is, on that wall with the big screen T.V., you then have a door to the left.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And that goes into what you call the master bathroom, is that correct, or you call it a bathroom. Whatever you call it.
Albert Lafferty: Uh-huh.
Mr. Sanger: That has a Jacuzzi.
Albert Lafferty: Right.
Mr. Sanger: And that area with the Jacuzzi actually has a number of books, there's writing materials, there's VCRs, there's all sorts of things in there; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: There's a place to sit that -- perhaps when the house was designed it was a vanity, but there's a place to sit, which appears to also include stacks of books and VCRs and things like that, correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: The actual water closet, as they say in England, but the toilet area is in a separate room off to the right of that; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And there's a closet in there that has even more books and other things in it; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And, in fact, right there, there's a back door to go out the back of the house, is there not.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, there is.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And then if we back out of there and we come back, having done that half right, we're facing the big screen T.V., on the right side there's another bathroom area; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, there is.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And there's a lot of stuff stored all over the place there, is that right, when you were there.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, there was.
Mr. Sanger: A lot of movie memorabilia.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you saw, you know, original things that appeared to be signed by all sorts of celebrities.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Walt Disney, Shirley Temple, Steven Spielberg, people like that.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And as you go in that bathroom area, there is an actual water closet or bathroom sink area that's off of that; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then you go up those stairs, up to the area where the bed is that you showed us; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Now, what kind of equipment were you using to film this.
Albert Lafferty: I was using a Sony DVCAM.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And how do you operate that.
Albert Lafferty: It's a basic camera used by a lot of the media that you see outside. It's a larger format camera.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Do you put it on your shoulder.
Albert Lafferty: It's a shoulder-mount-held, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you're looking through at -- your eye level is roughly the level of the lens; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And how tall are you, sir.
Albert Lafferty: Five-ten.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So when you walk up the stairs, you're walking up the stairs shooting at your eye level for a five-ten person; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. All right. Let me venture into the unknown and try to work this, if I may, Your Honor. What I propose to do is -- with the approval of the Court, and if there's no objection from the People, I propose to fast forward and just go to the particular points that I want to highlight, if that's all right.
The Court: I think that would be good.
Mr. Sanger: All right. (Laughter.)
Mr. Sneddon: I better not have any objection.
Mr. Sanger: And Mr. Sneddon's free to play it all again, if he wants.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm not that stupid.
Mr. Sanger: Did you turn it off. It's already -- okay. Okay. I'm actually going to pause here quickly.
Mr. Sanger: There's a little shot right at the beginning, the first few seconds, when you put this in the machine, it shows this area. And I don't think you commented on this. There appear to be some big video games and some arcade kind of games in the picture here. I stopped it at 07.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Where is that located.
Albert Lafferty: I have been informed that this was the arcade room, which was a building behind the main residence.
Mr. Sanger: Now, when you say you've been informed, does that mean you took this.
Albert Lafferty: I did not shoot this video, no.
Mr. Sanger: Were you in that building.
Albert Lafferty: No, I was not.
Mr. Sanger: Do you know who shot this footage.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sanger: Who do you believe shot this.
Albert Lafferty: Detective Wittenbrock.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, your official designation at the time you were doing this was as a forensic deputy, is that -- or what was the official title that you had.
Albert Lafferty: I was a detective assigned to the forensics bureau.
Mr. Sanger: Forensics bureau. Now, there's what's called crime scene investigators, or sometimes referred to as CSI crime scene investigator. I'm not talking about television. I'm talking about in your department. Unlike television, in your department, a CSI may not be an actual forensic deputy; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That is my job, crime scene investigation.
Mr. Sanger: Oops. Need to get closer. I didn't know what the bailiff was doing to me right then. (Laughter.)
Mr. Sanger: I'm glad it was a friendly gesture.
The Court: She wasn't going to hug you.
Mr. Sanger: I knew she was armed. I was afraid it might be something else.
Mr. Sanger: The -- okay. So at least at some point in your department, they might have a sergeant go out and be a CSI for a particular crime scene; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: But you now have a forensics bureau, and the forensic -- the officers, the deputies assigned to the forensic bureau are supposed to be the crime scene investigators, forensic experts or specialists in your department; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And you were one of them.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: How many forensic people did you have on November 18th, 2003.
Albert Lafferty: I believe there were seven of us.
Mr. Sanger: How many of them were detailed to this particular case.
Albert Lafferty: All of them.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Were they all out there that day.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Now, we were talking about who was out there. Besides however many police officers there were, there were a number of D.A.'s investigators; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Those are people who work for the District Attorney's Office as opposed to the sheriff or the police department; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: In addition to that, Mr. Sneddon actually came out and walked through Mr. Jackson's home; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And Mr. Franklin came out and did the same, is that correct, Deputy D.A. Franklin.
Albert Lafferty: I recall seeing him outside the residence. I don't know if he walked through.
Mr. Sanger: Now, let's go through this quickly, if we can. So we have some footage here -- let's see, I've got to point this right at it, I guess. There we go. We have some footage that fades out, and now the rest of this film is what you shot; correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So, we've been over it, but that's the front door leading into the foyer. And in the distance you can see an area that has -- well, let's see, you have your pointer there.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Is there a big clock right in there; do you recall.
Albert Lafferty: The pillar directly in this area, yeah.
Mr. Sanger: That's a big clock right there. All right. Oops. I'll point that there. Now, we just saw off to the left -- this may or may not work the way I'm -- there we go. Okay. There's a fella standing there.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Is that a real person.
Albert Lafferty: No, it's not.
Mr. Sanger: A mannequin.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sanger: There are a number of mannequins all over Neverland.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, there are.
Mr. Sanger: Some down by the -- by the big gates, when you come through the big gates --
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- in a little house there. They're all over the house in various places --
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- correct. That one appears to be a butler and he's holding a dish with cookies in it; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Did you go into Mr. Jackson's office.
Albert Lafferty: No, I did not.
Mr. Sanger: Let's see if I can fast forward here. Okay. And then that's a double door to the right of the door that we talked about. You go down a little hallway. There are books in the bookcases there; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: That's not the actual library we talked about, though, is it.
Albert Lafferty: No, it's not.
Mr. Sanger: If you go to the left through the double doors that you can see in the picture there, can you point that out to the --
Albert Lafferty: There is a set of double doors right here, which led into that library area also.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And there's a library of books all over the place in there on bookshelves, correct.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And if you go down this little hallway, that's where the double doors are to Mr. Jackson's suite --
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- that you described. Okay. And just to the left of that -- so we don't take too much time, I'll fast forward. But just to the left of this is the stairway. Outside the picture, there's a stairway that goes up to the children's suite.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Now, this is the area here at .38, .39. See the sitting area there.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. This is what I was referring to as the living room. Does that make sense.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And then this is the family room. I said plaid -- there's plaid on the wall, blue couches there.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Family room. And that's -- if you turn right around and did an about face from where you were just showing the family room, you do an about face, you're looking at the kitchen.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And it's open, this counter is right in between the two, right.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, there is.
Mr. Sanger: And when you were there, when the -- when the sheriffs arrived, there were a number of employees in this area; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: I was told that there were, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And so this is an open area where employees are, guests might come in, that sort of thing; is that your understanding.
Albert Lafferty: I believe so, yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. I'll fast forward again. Okay. Back to the -- that's down the hallway. And that's going into Mr. Jackson's area. We're at 153. That's going into his first-floor area. And then to the right, this is -- this is that right-hand area that we talked about. It actually -- you got into the closet here, I guess. We're looking at the screen at 203.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: But there's the right-hand bathroom. And you said if you face that big screen T.V. on the right side, the half right there, the big screen T.V., on the right side is the bathroom area and closets, correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: There's the stairway. And you're coming up the stairway there with the camera up to your eye, and you get up to the top there, and you look in; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object to that question. It's not at the top. The video speaks for itself in relationship to where it is.
The Court: Overruled. Go ahead.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you.
Mr. Sanger: We're going to fast forward here. Now, we're back down -- this is the area that you did the half right to the video screen, a big screen T.V. And you go to the left and you go into this area, correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And this you described as a bathroom. It does have that Jacuzzi tub at the end, correct.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And I'll try to fast forward. Can you show us where the door to the back is.
Albert Lafferty: It was behind the curtains in this area.
Mr. Sanger: If you go by that safe and you go to the right, and that's the actual door; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And those curtains are -- the curtains fit outside to the garden, I would suspect; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: I believe so, yes.
Mr. Sanger: There are curtains over windows to the outside. All right. And then if you go to the right, there's a safe there.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: With a picture of a little girl on the thing. And if you go to the right there, that's an area -- sort of a closet area, has a lot of books and other things in it; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Right here, this area, is that what you're referring to.
Mr. Sanger: Yes.
Albert Lafferty: That is the area that has the toilet in it.
Mr. Sanger: Are there two doors, or just one there.
Albert Lafferty: There's two doors on that side of the room.
Mr. Sanger: And you believe that's the one that goes to the toilet area.
Albert Lafferty: I believe so, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Could that be the one that goes to the toilet area, the one on the right.
Albert Lafferty: The one on the left is the one that goes into the toilet area.
Mr. Sanger: You're right. There's a toilet; how about that. So the other one is the one that goes into the closet that has books and other memorabilia and stuff.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And here we have the sort of living room. There's a couch. There's a fireplace. To the left, you can't see it, but there's a big screen T.V., which we're about to see. There it is, with the movie cut out in front of it. And then you go back out the door. All right. I'm going to stop it. And we can turn it off, I think.
The Bailiff: Can you just hit “black screen”.
Mr. Sanger: Now, how long was the actual video that you did in this -- on this location. I mean, you did one video before the search. How long was that video.
Albert Lafferty: It was approximately an hour.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And then you did more documentation afterwards. About how long was that.
Albert Lafferty: I did a total of three tapes. The post-search video was approximately an hour also.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So out of the first hour, you selected so many minutes that we just saw there; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, you did take some still photos, you said, of various items. Did you take any still photos in one of the bathroom areas, which you've described as the bathroom.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Did you take photos of a briefcase.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, at some point, as the forensic investigator in this case, did you take charge of the materials that were inside of that briefcase.
Albert Lafferty: The initial collection was done by the detectives who were conducting the search. It was later turned over to us, which was secured in our lab.
Mr. Sanger: All right. What -- do you know the sheriff's number for the materials that were inside that briefcase.
Albert Lafferty: No, I do not.
Mr. Sanger: Does 317 ring a bell.
Albert Lafferty: I don't know.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Did you bring your reports with you.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sanger: Can you tell by looking at your various reports what the number of those items was.
Albert Lafferty: I do not show -- I'm sorry. I do have one report that refers to No. 317.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So the contents of the briefcase were Sheriff's Item 317; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: I was not involved with the assignment of the number. I don't know what number it was assigned at the time.
Mr. Sanger: Let's talk about numbers just for a second. We have exhibit numbers in court here that are assigned by the clerk. There may be reference to exhibit numbers from another proceeding; for instance, the grand jury. But when the sheriff -- when your department seizes evidence, you mark down a number on an inventory sheet, and then you put that number on a tag, and you put that on the actual item that's seized; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: So you can keep track -- no matter what numbers the Court gives, or, say, the grand jury gives something, there's also the sheriff's number. And we can go back to that, and you can say that's the item, because it was given that number; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, do you remember checking the contents of the briefcase out of the sheriff's lockup; in other words, sheriff's evidence lockup to take to the lab.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object, because there were several briefcases taken. And I'm -- it's unclear as to which one he's talking about. He has no personal knowledge as to what the itemization of the number was, so lack of foundation would be the short way of putting it.
The Court: Foundation; sustained.
Mr. Sanger: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And you can't tell -- you can't tell us from your reports what items you took out of the sheriff's lockup to do testing on.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I can.
Mr. Sanger: Do you want to tell us what numbers those were.
Albert Lafferty: The original ones which I was assigned to begin with was 304, 306, 307, 309, and 313.
Mr. Sanger: Did you eventually take 317.
Albert Lafferty: The only involvement that I had with that initially was I picked up Item 317 from the Department of Justice Lab and took it back for photo documentation at our lab.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And what date was that.
Albert Lafferty: That was on 5-20-04.
Mr. Sanger: Do you recall on January 30th assisting Deputy Herman. Is that Lisa Herman.
Albert Lafferty: Hemman.
Mr. Sanger: Sorry. Hemman. Do you recall assisting Deputy Hemman in going through various evidence items.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sanger: And among those evidence items was 317, one of those items.
Albert Lafferty: It may have been. I don't recall the specific number.
Mr. Sanger: And when you were working with Deputy Hemman -- when you were assisting Deputy Hemman, what were you doing. Were you doing fingerprints.
Albert Lafferty: That was an alternate light source search.
Mr. Sanger: So you weren't looking for fingerprints.
Albert Lafferty: No.
Mr. Sanger: You were looking at the items to see if there was some other substance, fluid, blood, semen, something on them; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And you didn't find anything on 317.
Albert Lafferty: I don't know.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Okay. Can I have -- and I suppose the clerk has them now -- the exhibits that this witness referred to. And I think it was 4 or 5 through about 12. The photographs. Okay. Thank you. Now, venturing into yet another area, with the Court's permission, I'm going to try to use the overhead projector. And let's see here. I think we hit that button.
The Bailiff: And you hit the “black screen” button. And is it on.
Mr. Sanger: Yes, it is. How about that.
Mr. Sanger: I want to direct your attention -- okay. If you put the lights on it there's a little more light, but then there's glare. If you look at Exhibit 8, which has been received in evidence - and I put it up on the overhead camera - that's one of the pictures you told us that you had taken, and then you put the labeling on to show what the various parts of the ranch were, correct.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And with your laser there, if you could, show us where the lake is. I think we can see it. But just to orient, because it's a little dark.
Albert Lafferty: The dark area, beginning in the center of the photograph, extending up and to the left, around. That area there.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And right there where it says “Guesthouse”, those are the guest units on the property; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And they're right on the lake; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Did you determine what the numbers of the guest units were. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Albert Lafferty: No, I do not.
Mr. Sanger: There are four, though, four units in that area, correct.
Albert Lafferty: I'm not aware of how many there are.
Mr. Sanger: In any event, there's a guesthouse that appears to have more than one unit. Would you grant me that.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: There you go. And then the main house is depicted. You can see the main house from the guesthouse, correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And, in fact, you just walk -- how far is the main house from the guesthouse.
Albert Lafferty: 75 yards.
Mr. Sanger: Oh. Now, see the train station there.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And the train station is actually up on a hill; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And there's a road that leads -- in the picture that's going up, but actually goes downhill towards the main house and the guesthouse; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Can you show the jury where that is, please.
Albert Lafferty: This is the building of the train station here. And this is the road that leads up past the main house.
Mr. Sanger: So the main house is on the left and the guesthouse is on the right.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And there's a clock that -- a large decorative clock that is located right in front of that train station; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And I'm going to put up No. 12, which has been received into evidence. No. 12 is an aerial shot of that clock; is that correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sanger: And of course, from the air, everything looks flat on the ground. You don't really see the contours of the hills and so on; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And, in fact, the clock itself is created on about a 45-degree angle; was it not.
Albert Lafferty: I was not in that area, so I couldn't say.
Mr. Sanger: So you took the picture from up above.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And how high were you. What was your elevation when you took that picture.
Albert Lafferty: We were about 1200 to 1500 feet.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So this clock would be visible from thousands of feet in the area; is that right.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And it tells time. It's a working clock, correct.
Albert Lafferty: I do not know that.
Mr. Sanger: When you -- when you were on the ground there, you didn't look over and see that clock.
Albert Lafferty: I did see the clock.
Mr. Sanger: So when you're on the ground, by the house and the guest units, you could look over and see that clock, correct.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And when I said “45-degree angle”, I'm not trying to quibble. I don't know. I didn't measure. Okay. But it's not on the ground flat, facing into space.
Albert Lafferty: Correct. It is at an angle.
Mr. Sanger: It's at an angle so you can see it from the property.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Did you notice that there were a number of other clocks that were positioned in various place on this property.
Albert Lafferty: The only area that I was on the property was at the main residence.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Let me just have one moment, Your Honor, please. I have no further questions. Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: No questions, Your Honor. Your Honor, I --
The Court: You may step down, Officer. Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: I have the next witness ready. It's five minutes to break time. Do you want to take the break five minutes early before we start that witness.
The Court: No, we can start the witness.
Mr. Sneddon: It will take two minutes to get her here.
Mr. Sanger: Let me use ten seconds of the two minutes, Your Honor.
The Court: Well, the witness is on its way. You can go ahead.
Mr. Sanger: I was just going to say before Deputy Lafferty leaves, that we would like him to remain on re-call. And I think we will have to call him back when we have other officers to testify to the chain of custody on the items we're talking about.
The Court: All right. Officer, you'll remain on call, please.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, I'm sorry. My understanding was that the witness was right behind your door, right off your room in the anteroom there, and it would take less than 20 seconds to get here. It's one of the children in this case. I apologize, but that was my understanding. It's not -- she's not up in my office. Jill. Right off your room in the anteroom there, and it would take
The Court: Come forward to the witness stand, please. Remain standing. Face the clerk, over here, raise your right hand.

Davellin Arvizo: I'm a freshman in college.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you have a full-time job.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes, I work full time.
The Court: Just a moment. Just a moment. Mr. Sneddon, they can't hear. It is time for the break. Maybe you could work with her on the mike for a moment after we take our break. We'll take our break.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, just to forewarn the Court, we may be wanting you to go to Input 1, to hook up the computer to --
The Court: I'll be ready.
Mr. Sneddon: I hope so.
Mr. Sneddon: So how we doing on the mike.
Davellin Arvizo: Fine.
Mr. Sneddon: Lean into it.
Davellin Arvizo: Sorry.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Talk loud. Okay. Now, you're a full-time student at a college as a freshman, correct.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you have a job.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes. I work full time.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, let's go back in time a little bit.
Davellin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And let's go back to the year of 1999.
Davellin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Where did you go to school then.
Davellin Arvizo: It was either eighth grade or the beginning of freshman year in coll -- no, high school.
Mr. Sneddon: And let's talk about the eighth grade in 1999. All right. Where did you go to the eighth grade; what school.
Davellin Arvizo: Hollywood Middle School.
Mr. Sneddon: Then you went to high school as a freshman in the same year, '99.
Davellin Arvizo: Uh-huh.
Mr. Sneddon: You have to say “Yes” or “No”.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what high school did you go to.
Davellin Arvizo: I went to Hollywood High School.
Mr. Sneddon: Where were you living at this time.
Davellin Arvizo: In East L.A.
Mr. Sneddon: How is it that you ended up at Hollywod High School when you lived in East Los Angeles.
Davellin Arvizo: The school bus would come pick me up because I was a magnet student.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what a magnet student means.
Davellin Arvizo: You have to have good grades. And they have, like, special extracurricular activities.
Mr. Sneddon: And what particular extracurricular activities were you involved in.
Davellin Arvizo: Performing arts.
Mr. Sneddon: And were you doing that as like a -- what aspect of that.
Davellin Arvizo: Like fixing the stage and stuff like that.
Mr. Sneddon: So you were the technical person, huh.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: You weren't the performer.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, how long were you at Hollywood High.
Davellin Arvizo: For about two years.
Mr. Sneddon: So it would be through your freshman and sophomore years.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the time that you were at Hollywood High, during your time that you were there, where were you living. Specifically, what address.
Davellin Arvizo: Um, it was on Soto Street. It was a bachelor's apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you describe to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what the size of the interior of this apartment was.
Davellin Arvizo: About from here to that other wall. It wasn't very big at all.
Mr. Sneddon: “From here”, do you mean from the railing of the jury box.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: To the far wall of the courtroom.
Davellin Arvizo: No, the end of that wall.
Mr. Sneddon: Where the sign says “Lorna Frey”.
Davellin Arvizo: Uh-huh.
Mr. Sneddon: I wanted to get you on the record. (Laughter.)
Mr. Sneddon: Now, how many people were living in this apartment or --
Davellin Arvizo: At the beginning, five.
Mr. Sneddon: Five. And who would that be.
Davellin Arvizo: My father, my mother, and me and my brothers.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's go back. Your father's name is.
Davellin Arvizo: David.
Mr. Sneddon: And his last name.
Davellin Arvizo: Arvizo.
Mr. Sneddon: And your mother's first name.
Davellin Arvizo: Janet.
Mr. Sneddon: And your brother's first name.
Davellin Arvizo: Gavin.
Mr. Sneddon: Is Gavin younger or older than you.
Davellin Arvizo: He's younger.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you have another brother.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And that brother's name.
Davellin Arvizo: Star.
Mr. Sneddon: And is he younger or older than Gavin.
Davellin Arvizo: He's younger.
Mr. Sneddon: And you now have another brother; is that correct.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And his name is.
Davellin Arvizo: Jett.
Mr. Sneddon: And how old is Jett.
Davellin Arvizo: He's seven months.
Mr. Sneddon: So at that time, there were the five of you living in this apartment.
Davellin Arvizo: Uh-huh. Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the -- sometime in 2000, did something happen with regard to one or more of your brothers.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes. Gavin was diagnosed with cancer.

Davellin Arvizo: She didn't.
Mr. Sneddon: On the occasion of when you went there for the Bashir filming, was your mother with you.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Between the time that you went to the ranch on the very first time that you've described to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the incident involving your mother and father, let's put it that way, until the time you went back with Chris Tucker, do you know, of your own personal knowledge, whether your brother and your father went back to the ranch.

Mr. Sneddon: And where was he living during that time.
Davellin Arvizo: He was living with my grandmother.
Mr. Sneddon: And could you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what adjustments had to be made.
Davellin Arvizo: They had -- they had to be very, very clean; no dust. It had to be very cool. He couldn't be in hot conditions or he would either go into a seizure or he would pass out. He was very, very delicate.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. What -- were there any special things that had to be purchased or changes made in the room in which Gavin stayed at your grandmother and grandfather's.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you describe that to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
Davellin Arvizo: In that room, the carpet was totally torn out, and they put linoleum down. Because his bones, they ache a lot. And then my mom bought an orthopedic-type bed. And then all the walls were repainted. They bought an air conditioning -- like a little unit, tore a hole through that wall, so the -- like the bad heat would go out through the air conditioning.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there any sort of little treats that were bought for Gavin during this time.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, his --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes, because we constantly wanted to make him very happy because of the things that the doctors were telling us. So my mom bought him a T.V., a DVD player, a stereo. That's all I remember right now.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, the things that you just described, what room in the house were those items located.
Davellin Arvizo: In one of the bedrooms in my grandmother's house.
Mr. Sneddon: The one that Gavin occupied.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to this T.V. that was in the room that Gavin was in, how big was this T.V..

Mr. Sneddon: And you were there when she came.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And to your knowledge, did she give money to your family.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right --
The Court: Do you want to just wait a minute.
Mr. Sneddon: I guess I can. I didn't know how long he was going to be, Your Honor. I guess we don't want his head popping up when I show the photographs.
The Sound Technician: My apologies.
The Court: Thank you, Peter.
Mr. Sneddon: Try it again.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, if you could take the next photograph, which I believe is marked as 337. Do you see that one in front of you.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, who is the person in the middle of that photograph.
Davellin Arvizo: That's Gavin.
Mr. Sneddon: And can you tell -- who's the person over on the right-hand side.
Davellin Arvizo: That's Star.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, do you recognize the room in which this photograph is taken.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you tell the jury what it is, what room it is.
Davellin Arvizo: It's the room that we fixed up for Gavin in my grandma's house.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that what Gavin looked like.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, do you, of your own personal knowledge, know where the money came to fix that room up.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Who.
Davellin Arvizo: Louise.
Mr. Sneddon: She gave you the money to do all that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you talked about an air conditioning unit that had to be put in the room so that he wouldn't go into seizures. Do you see that air conditioning unit in that photograph.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes. It's right behind Star's head.
Mr. Sneddon: There's a little laser up there. Do you see that little black, long thing that looks like a pencil. Well, I guess it's not up there.
Mr. Zonen: Right there.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you turn around to the exhibit that's been displayed on the board there. And this is Exhibit 337. And can you point out the air unit you were talking about.
Davellin Arvizo: It's right there.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. That's right behind Star's head. And is the -- Gavin appears to be seated on a bed.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that the bed that you bought, or was that bed in there before.
Davellin Arvizo: No, that was the new bed.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I think we can take the photograph down, Your Honor, and put the lights back on.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever meet an individual by the name of Carol LaMere.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did you meet her.
Davellin Arvizo: We met her at a dance studio.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you -- how did that come about that you met her at the dance studio.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, we just started a dance -- well, we went to Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy's dance studio.
Mr. Sneddon: I couldn't get that, so I'm sure the jury didn't. Say it again.
Davellin Arvizo: We went to a dance studio. Mr. and Mrs. Dance Studio -- Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy's dance studio.
Mr. Sneddon: Was that before or after you had attended the comedy camp.
Davellin Arvizo: This is way before.
Mr. Sneddon: And you say “we”. Who's “we”.
Davellin Arvizo: Me and my brothers.
Mr. Sneddon: What kind of a dancing school was it.
Davellin Arvizo: Kind of everything. But mostly, like, tap was focused on.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you, as a result -- let me ask you this: Ms. LaMere, was she working there, or how did you meet her.
Davellin Arvizo: Her grandson was taking a class there.
Mr. Sneddon: So you met her through a mutual acquaintance.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever stay with Miss LaMere.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when I say “stayed”, where did you stay with her.
Davellin Arvizo: At her house.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recall on how many occasions that was.
Davellin Arvizo: A couple, three maybe. I don't remember. But I would stay about a week or so.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember anything in particular about your stays with Mrs. LaMere.
Davellin Arvizo: They weren't that pleasant.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry.
Davellin Arvizo: They weren't that pleasant.
Mr. Sneddon: Why.
Davellin Arvizo: Because I'd mostly clean and do stuff for her.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, was there a time when your mother and your father became separated.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recall approximately when that was.
Davellin Arvizo: That was during my sophomore year.
Mr. Sneddon: And during that year, do you remember about whether it was in the spring part of that year or the fall --
Davellin Arvizo: The beginning.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when your father and your mother separated, where did the family -- where did you stay. Where did you live after that.
Davellin Arvizo: Me and my mom and my brothers stood at the East L.A. apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: So he moved out.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember what school you were in at the time your father left.
Davellin Arvizo: I was still in the Hollywood High School.
Mr. Sneddon: And so that would have been -- how many years did you go to Hollywood High School.
Davellin Arvizo: Two.
Mr. Sneddon: And that would have been what years. I mean, in terms of the four years --
Davellin Arvizo: 2000. Or -- 2001.
Mr. Sneddon: But is it like senior-junior. Junior-sophomore.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, when he left.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, how many years did you go to Hollywood High.
Davellin Arvizo: Two.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: Freshman and sophomore.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. That's what I was trying to get at. Now, after Hollywood High School, where did you go your junior year.
Davellin Arvizo: Roosevelt High School.
Mr. Sneddon: And how far is Roosevelt High School from the place where you lived at Soto Street.
Davellin Arvizo: Three lights. It's four blocks or so. It's not that far.
Mr. Sneddon: And how -- this would have been your junior year now.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you complete the whole junior year at Roosevelt.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes. Well, most of it. I finished my sophomore year there.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. So you didn't complete two full years at Hollywood.
Davellin Arvizo: No, I left right before my sophomore year ended at Hollywood High School.
Mr. Sneddon: And then the next year, you took up at Roosevelt.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And this would have been your junior year.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at the time that you -- that your father left, you folks still lived at Soto Street, correct.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: At the time that you went to school at Roosevelt, where did the family live.
Davellin Arvizo: We still lived at the East L.A. apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that -- what's the address there, the street at least.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, the Soto Street apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: Let's just refer to it as the Soto Street apartment.
Davellin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: So everybody knows what you're talking about when we talk about that. Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the time that you were living at the Soto Street apartment, during the summer, did you ever go to any academies.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, I'm going to show you another picture.
Davellin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: I think what I'll do, I'll save us some time here, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I have three more photographs. And let's take these and put them up here out of the way, so we don't get them mixed up. And, first of all, let's just start with these three.
Davellin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: And I'm just going to ask you a couple of questions. Do you recognize the person depicted in that photograph.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that an accurate depiction of what she looks like.
Davellin Arvizo: Not right now.
Mr. Sneddon: Not right now. But I mean --
Davellin Arvizo: Not her hair.
Mr. Sneddon: Not her hair right now.
Davellin Arvizo: But, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And the next person -- the next photograph, which is 35.
The Court: What exhibits are you referring to.
Mr. Sneddon: I think I mentioned it was 31, Your Honor.
The Court: Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: And the next one is 35.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recognize that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that an accurate depiction of the person.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And let's go to the next one, which is -- move your hand back a little -- 338. Do you recognize that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that an accurate depiction of the people depicted in there.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Move they be admitted into evidence.
Mr. Mesereau: No objection, Your Honor.
The Court: Admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. If we could have the lights down for just a second.
Mr. Sneddon: And I want to direct your attention to the exhibit marked as 31 in evidence. No, not that one. I'm sorry, my fault. There. 31. Do you recognize that person.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Who is that.
Davellin Arvizo: That's my mommy.
Mr. Sneddon: It's your who.
Davellin Arvizo: Mommy.
Mr. Sneddon: You say she doesn't look like that now, because her hair -- what's different.
Davellin Arvizo: Her hair is darker and shorter.
Mr. Sneddon: Other than that, it looks like your mom.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. The next one, let's go to 35. All right. Who's that.
Davellin Arvizo: That's David.
Mr. Sneddon: David who.
Davellin Arvizo: My father.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's go to the next one. All right. Do you recognize that photograph.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what was the occasion for this particular photograph; do you remember.
Davellin Arvizo: Just taking pictures of each other. And I had my Explorer uniform on. So we just went and took pictures.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. What -- you say your “Explorer uniform on”. What do you mean by that. What is an Explorer.
Davellin Arvizo: I worked with the Los Angeles Police Department.
Mr. Sneddon: And how long did you work for them.
Davellin Arvizo: For about a year.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you have to go to some kind of training before you could work for the department.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what kind of training did you go to.
Davellin Arvizo: It was a little academy. It was about 12 Saturdays during the summer.
Mr. Sneddon: And then at the end, there's a --
Davellin Arvizo: A graduation.
Mr. Sneddon: And then you get a uniform.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that what you wore to work when you went to work.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
The Court: What exhibit number is it.
Mr. Sneddon: 338, Your Honor. All right. You can take that photograph down, and we can get the lights back on, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you told the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that at some point in time you had gone to the ranch, Mr. Jackson's ranch, Neverland Valley Ranch. Did -- to your knowledge, did Mr. Jackson ever give the family any presents.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to your going to the police academy, were any of those presents used in connection with that.
Davellin Arvizo: What do you mean.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, just what I said. Were there any things that Mr. Jackson gave you that were used in --
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What.
Davellin Arvizo: It was a white Bronco.
Mr. Sneddon: So Mr. Jackson gave you folks a car.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember when that was.
Davellin Arvizo: That was during Gavin's cancer.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember when it was in relationship to the academy, how much before you started the academy.
Davellin Arvizo: How long did we keep it.
Mr. Sneddon: Let me go back and ask you another question. When you went to the Explorer's academy --
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- was this during the summer or was it during the school year.
Davellin Arvizo: It was during the summer.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember between what grades it was.
Davellin Arvizo: Freshman -- freshman and sophomore, I think it was. Yeah, because I was -- I graduated in 2001. The academy was in August. It ended in August. I started it -- I joined the Explorers in May. The academy ended in August.
Mr. Sneddon: And who took you to the academy on Saturdays.
Davellin Arvizo: My mom did.
Mr. Sneddon: And how did you get there.
Davellin Arvizo: We would take the white Bronco.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know how long you'd had that Bronco before you started the academy.
Davellin Arvizo: It was given to Gavin like in the middle of his cancer, so like six months or so before that.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you know what happened to the Bronco.
Davellin Arvizo: It started stalling and started breaking down, and just wouldn't turn on anymore.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Did you keep it at the house.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What happened to it after that.
Davellin Arvizo: Somebody came and picked it up and took it away.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever see it again.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, were there other things that you did with Chris Tucker, other than going to the Neverland Valley Ranch with him.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What other things did you do with Chris Tucker.
Davellin Arvizo: He took us to the Oakland game. We went --
Mr. Sneddon: Oakland --
Davellin Arvizo: Raiders game.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: And we would just go to his house. And sometimes I would go sleep over Azja's house.
Mr. Sneddon: Who is Azja.
Davellin Arvizo: That's Chris Tucker's fiancee.
Mr. Sneddon: Any other occasions you recall being places with Mr. Tucker.
Davellin Arvizo: Not that I remember right now.
Mr. Sneddon: At some point in time, you went back to the ranch on another occasion; is that correct.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Other than the first one you've talked about.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury about that.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Do you recall approximately when it was you went back to the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: About a year.
Mr. Sneddon: What time of the year was this, now.
Davellin Arvizo: I think it was during the summer. I really don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Let me ask you this, because that was probably a bad question on my part: When you went back to -- to the ranch with regard to the Bashir filming that you've described to us --
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- do you remember when that was. What time of year was that.
Davellin Arvizo: That was in November. The Bashir taping.
Mr. Sneddon: Who went.
Davellin Arvizo: Me and my brothers.
Mr. Sneddon: And how did you get there.
Davellin Arvizo: A limo came and picked us up.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you got to the ranch, could you tell the jury, what was the first thing that happened after you got out of the limo.
Davellin Arvizo: We walked to -- in the entrance, in the back entrance. Then Mr. Jackson came and met us.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. What part of the house were you in.
Davellin Arvizo: In the back of -- right before you get to the kitchen. There's like refrigerators and stuff right there.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you went into the house, did your brothers go with you.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes. We all three went in at the same time.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what happened when Mr. Jackson appeared.
Davellin Arvizo: He told me and Star -- he told me and Star to excuse him, that he needed to talk to Gavin for a couple minutes.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you see where Mr. Jackson went.
Davellin Arvizo: They walked into the main dining room.
Mr. Sneddon: You say “they”. Who is that.
Davellin Arvizo: Gavin and Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that an enclosed area.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. It has a swinging door. You can close it.
Mr. Sneddon: So they went on the other side of the swinging door.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And how long were Mr. Jackson and your brother gone.
Davellin Arvizo: About five, ten minutes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, after -- after they -- after that, what happened.
Davellin Arvizo: They did the taping.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. When you say “They did the taping”, will you tell them what you saw. Where were you.
Davellin Arvizo: I was standing inside the kitchen. And they were sitting down in the little sitting area right in front of the kitchen.
Mr. Sneddon: So you could see what was going on.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you see your brother interviewed.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Was there another part of the time that you were there that -- where you were filmed.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And where did that occur.
Davellin Arvizo: Inside the kitchen.
Mr. Sneddon: What was going on.
Davellin Arvizo: Gavin and Star were doing their little Navy marching thing. And I was standing there talking to Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when the three of you went to the ranch that day, you were picked up on the limo and taken to Mr. Jackson's ranch, did you know what the purpose of the trip was.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you discuss it with your brothers at all.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you know there was going to be a film that day.
Davellin Arvizo: I think I remember just -- when we got there, we saw -- we thought it was just one of his, like, personal tapings.
Mr. Sneddon: What do you mean by “personal tapings”.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, because there had been a previous video that he taped of him and Gavin and Star.
Mr. Sneddon: After the filming was completed, did you stay at the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did your brothers, to your knowledge, stay at the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: How long did the three of you stay.
Davellin Arvizo: Just that night.
Mr. Sneddon: And so you left the next day.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, Mr. Jackson; did you see Mr. Jackson after that.
Davellin Arvizo: After they were done with the taping, he left.
Mr. Sneddon: So how long, in your estimation, were you there in Mr. Jackson's house with Mr. Jackson from the time that you first walked through the door to the time that Mr. Jackson walked out. How long do you think that was.
Davellin Arvizo: Half an hour, 45 minutes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did your mom go with you.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at the time that you were called by Mr. Jackson -- strike that. At the time you were called and you went to the ranch for the Bashir filming --
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- where were you living.
Davellin Arvizo: We were living at the East L.A. apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: And who was living there.
Davellin Arvizo: Me, my mom and my brothers.
Mr. Sneddon: And where were you going to school.
Davellin Arvizo: Roosevelt.
Mr. Sneddon: After the time that you -- well, let me just ask one other thing here. Are you familiar or acquainted with a person by the name of Jay Jackson.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And who, to your knowledge, is Jay Jackson.
Davellin Arvizo: He's my stepfather.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember approximately when it was you first met Mr. Jackson, Jay Jackson.
Davellin Arvizo: It was after the Bashir taping, I think. I don't -- yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And to your knowledge, what is Mr. Jackson's profession or occupation.
Davellin Arvizo: He's a major in the Army.
Mr. Sneddon: And was he a major in the Army at the time that you first met him.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And to your knowledge, did Mr. Jackson and your mother begin to date.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, after the Bashir filming, did something unusual happen with regard to people coming around the house.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you tell us what happened.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, a couple of British reporters came to the East L.A. apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know of your own personal knowledge -- well, were you there when they came.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And who did they want to talk to.
Davellin Arvizo: They wanted to talk to Gavin.
Mr. Sneddon: Was your mother there when they came.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Who else was there.
Davellin Arvizo: Me and my brother and Jay.
Mr. Sneddon: Did anybody actually do an interview with them that day.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, where do your grandparents live.
Davellin Arvizo: They live in El Monte.
Mr. Sneddon: And in relationship -- I know this is kind of -- but just give us a rough estimation. How far is it from where they live in El Monte to where you lived on Soto Street in East Los Angeles.
Davellin Arvizo: Without any traffic, about 20, 30 minutes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, were you ever present at your grandparents when any reporters came.
Davellin Arvizo: Do you mean during that time that --
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: During that time. Now, at this point in time, where the reporters came to the Soto Street apartment - okay. - what high school were you going to.
Davellin Arvizo: Roosevelt.
Mr. Sneddon: Still at Roosevelt.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And still living in the apartment.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Shortly after that -- let me go back. Do you -- do you have a cell phone.
Davellin Arvizo: Right now, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you have a cell phone then.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And so if you wanted to call your mother, how did you do that.
Davellin Arvizo: I would call her from the pay phone.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you have a practice or a custom of doing that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. I would always call her probably during my lunch or right before I would get on the bus to go home, just to say hi or tell her I'm coming home, or see how the boys are doing.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you consider your family a close family.
Davellin Arvizo: Very close.
Mr. Sneddon: And what do you mean by that.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, me and my brothers especially were very close because of what we've gone through with my father and stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: When you -- when you meet somebody, how do you greet them.
Davellin Arvizo: We hug them.
Mr. Sneddon: Even if it's the first time.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you did that to me, didn't you.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: You do it to everybody.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Who taught you to do that.
Davellin Arvizo: My mom did.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I -- it's eleven o'clock. Is that not the right time. I'm sorry. Okay. I just want to make sure.
The Court: You sure like those breaks, don't you. (Laughter.)
Mr. Sneddon: Well, when your stomach starts growling, it's telling you something. You don't, so....
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now -- one of your better ones. Did you at some time talk to your mom on the phone and learn that you were going to be going on a trip.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you tell the jury about that.
Davellin Arvizo: I called my mom, just a regular phone call, and then she said that --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: So you called your mom on the phone.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And without telling us what was said, did your mom talk to you.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And as a result of what your mom told you, did you do something.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. What did you do.
Davellin Arvizo: Went -- we went to the East L.A. apartment and then Adrian came and picked me up.
Mr. Sneddon: When you went to the East L.A. apartment, was your mother there.
Davellin Arvizo: No, she wasn't.
Mr. Sneddon: Were your brothers there.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you know who Adrian is.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Who's Adrian.
Davellin Arvizo: He's kind of like Chris Tucker's assistant/friend.
Mr. Sneddon: And before you got in the car with this Adrian, did you do anything while you were at the house.
Davellin Arvizo: Tried to gather some things. I didn't really have that many clothes there.
Mr. Sneddon: Why did you do that.
Davellin Arvizo: Because we were going on a trip.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you understand where you were going.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where.
Davellin Arvizo: Miami.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. So you packed some clothes. And then Adrian took you where.
Davellin Arvizo: He took me to Chris Tuck -- Chris Tucker's house.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know where Chris Tucker lives.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Or lived at that time.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where.
Davellin Arvizo: He lives off Reseda Boulevard. I don't know what city it is. All I know is the street we get off to go to his house on the freeway.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you got to Chris Tucker's, who was there.
Davellin Arvizo: My mom, my brothers, Chris, the bus driver. I don't -- I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. When you all -- when you arrived at Chris Tucker's, at any point in time did you leave.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did you go.
Davellin Arvizo: We left in Chris Tucker's private bus and he took us to a jet.
Mr. Sneddon: Took you where.
Davellin Arvizo: To a private jet.
Mr. Sneddon: And you say “us”. Could you tell us who “us” were.
Davellin Arvizo: Me, my brothers and my mom.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Was there anybody else on the bus.
Davellin Arvizo: Chris.
Mr. Sneddon: Any of his family.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you know where -- you ended up at an airport somewhere. Do you know where it was.
Davellin Arvizo: No. I don't remember. It was dark.
Mr. Sneddon: So you got into -- now, was this like a commercial airline, plane.
Davellin Arvizo: It was a private jet.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And who got on the plane.
Davellin Arvizo: Me, my brothers, and my mom and Chris.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there any other people on the plane.
Davellin Arvizo: Besides the pilot and the flight attendant, no.
Mr. Sneddon: So there was a flight attendant.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Was that a male or a female.
Davellin Arvizo: Female.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, about what time is it when you finally got to the airport.
Davellin Arvizo: It's nighttime. Like early night.
Mr. Sneddon: Was it light or dark.
Davellin Arvizo: Dark. Starting to fade.
Mr. Sneddon: And you flew -- how long did the flight last.
Davellin Arvizo: Five, six hours.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you know where you were when you landed.
Davellin Arvizo: Miami.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that the first time you'd ever been in a private jet.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, we went to Oakland in a private jet, too, when he took us to the Oakland game.
Mr. Sneddon: Mr. Tucker.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: So that's the second time you've been in a private jet.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: On this particular occasion when you were flying with Mr. Tucker, by this time, how long had you known him.
Davellin Arvizo: For a while.
Mr. Sneddon: Had you already been to his brother's wedding.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you'd already been to his house.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you consider him a good friend.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, tell us what happened when you got to Miami.
Davellin Arvizo: We got off the plane. We went to Chris Tucker's room for a while. We chatted. And then we went to our room.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember the name of the place that you stayed at.
Davellin Arvizo: I just know it was a resort.
Mr. Sneddon: Was it a nice resort.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, in relationship to where your room was, where was Mr. Tucker's room.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't know. In a totally different building.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember, in terms of the building that you were in with your room, on what floor it was.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember. I think it was the sixth floor. I'm not sure. I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: It wasn't the bottom floor.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And on -- after you visited with Mr. Tucker, you said you went back to your room. When you say “you”, who was with you.
Davellin Arvizo: My mom, my brothers and me.
Mr. Sneddon: Were you all in the same room.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you got back to your room that night, what did you do.
Davellin Arvizo: Went to sleep.
Mr. Sneddon: And then the next morning, what did you do. Do you remember what time you got up.
Davellin Arvizo: Early afternoon. And we got up and we went to go see Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you went to see Mr. Jackson, where did you go in that building.
Davellin Arvizo: One floor up.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was your room in relationship to his room. I mean, it's one floor up, but do you --
Davellin Arvizo: Pretty much right on top of ours.
Mr. Sneddon: When you got into Mr. Jackson's room, can you describe what the room looked like.
Davellin Arvizo: It was very big. It had a kitchen, a living room, bedroom, a little dining room area. And then there was another room connected.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the bedroom, was there a door that led from the open area in the living room area that you described to the bedroom.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: So you could close the door.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: It isn't like a regular hotel where there's just a bed there and everyone's all in the same room with the bed.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, it's different.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you were in Mr. Jackson's room, did you meet some people there for the first time.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry, I didn't hear your answer.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you first got there, were you introduced to some people, you personally. Were you introduced to some people.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Was Mr. Jackson there when you got there.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did Mr. Jackson introduce you to anybody.

Mr. Sneddon: Do you know Dieter's last name.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know Ronald's last name.

Davellin Arvizo: Marie Nicole and Aldo.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you at some point meet anybody who was related to those two children.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And who was that.
Davellin Arvizo: Frank.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember Frank's last name.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What is it.
Davellin Arvizo: Tyson.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was it that you met Mr. Tyson.
Davellin Arvizo: There, but I had heard of him before.
Mr. Sneddon: You what.
Davellin Arvizo: I had never officially met him until being at the resort.
Mr. Sneddon: At the time that you met the people you referred to as Dieter and Ronald, was Mr. Tyson in the room at that time, or did he come in later.
Davellin Arvizo: I think he came in later.
Mr. Sneddon: And who introduced you to Mr. Tyson.
Davellin Arvizo: I think it was just a hi to each other and introduce ourselves. I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Were there any other people in the -- in Mr. Jackson's room other than Mr. Jackson and the people you've just described.
Davellin Arvizo: When we first got there, there was the two nannies and the three kids.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, the two nannies. Did you ever learn their names.
Davellin Arvizo: I just know one of their names.
Mr. Sneddon: And who was that.
Davellin Arvizo: Grace.
Mr. Sneddon: You don't know Grace's last name.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And you say “the three children”. Are you talking about Mr. Jackson's children.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And did -- were they -- they were in that room at the time you got there.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, if we can just go back just a moment. Do you remember about what time it was when you first got to Mr. Jackson's room and you entered the room and were introduced to Dieter and Ronald and saw the children.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What time was it.
Davellin Arvizo: Early afternoon.
Mr. Sneddon: So you guys slept in, huh.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recall -- what was the first thing that occurred there after the introductions.
Davellin Arvizo: We just sat down, just -- I don't remember really. We just sat down or played around, like with the kids and stuff.

Mr. Sneddon: Did you at any point in time see the defendant in this case, Mr. Jackson, and your brother Gavin go back into Mr. Jackson's bedroom.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Move to strike.
The Court: Stricken.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you tell us whether or not at some point in time on that particular day, when you were in that particular room with those particular people, that the defendant went anywhere with your brother.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Would you tell us where.
Davellin Arvizo: He pulled him aside into his room.
Mr. Sneddon: I couldn't hear you.
Davellin Arvizo: He pulled him aside into his room.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you tell us whether or not the door was open or closed after they went into his room.
Davellin Arvizo: It was shut.
Mr. Sneddon: To your knowledge, did anybody else go in the room with them at the time that they went in the room and closed the door.
Davellin Arvizo: Not that I remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall how long they were in there.
Davellin Arvizo: For 15, 30 minutes. I don't -- for a while. I don't know approximately timewise.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there -- were there any other times while you were in the room that day that the defendant in this case, Mr. Jackson, and your brother Gavin went into that room again.
Davellin Arvizo: A couple of times.
Mr. Sneddon: So how many times in total do you think it was that your brother Gavin and Mr. Jackson went back into his bedroom.
Davellin Arvizo: About two, three times.
Mr. Sneddon: And on those occasions, can you tell us whether or not, like the first time, the door was closed or open.
Davellin Arvizo: It was closed.
Mr. Sneddon: And like on the first occasion, to your knowledge, did anybody else go in there with them.
Davellin Arvizo: Not that I remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, how long did you stay in Mr. Jackson's suite.
Davellin Arvizo: All day.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember about what time it was you left.
Davellin Arvizo: Nighttime, when we were going to go to sleep.
Mr. Sneddon: So was it light or dark outside.
Davellin Arvizo: Dark. We don't really know, because all the windows were shut, all the curtains were closed.
Mr. Sneddon: But you were tired, huh.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. It was -- it had to be night.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at any time on that particular day when you were in Mr. -- let me just go back and make sure we lay the foundation of this correctly so everybody understands. You got there at some time in the afternoon, and you don't leave till sometime at the night.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Correct. Did you ever leave that room.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Mr. Jackson's complex there.

Mr. Sneddon: To your knowledge, did Gavin ever leave that room.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And to your knowledge, did Star ever leave that room.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at some time during the time that you're in Mr. Jackson's complex and the rooms that he has there, did you see your brother Gavin act in what you considered, in your opinion, to be peculiar.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; vague.
The Court: It's leading.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you the tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury whether or not you observed anything unusual about your brother's behavior that night.
Davellin Arvizo: He was just very hyper.
Mr. Sneddon: Describe what you mean by that.
Davellin Arvizo: Very talkative. Running around. Very, very playful.
Mr. Sneddon: Why did you consider that noteworthy.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't know. It was just more than usual. Like more talkative, more jumpy and stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, on that particular evening -- let me strike that. During the time that you were in Mr. Jackson's suite, did Mr. Jackson -- can you tell us whether or not Mr. Jackson ever said anything with regard to any of the programs that were going to be seen on the television that night.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. What did he say.
Davellin Arvizo: For us not to watch it.
Mr. Sneddon: Watch “it”; what's “it”.
Davellin Arvizo: The Bashir documentary.
Mr. Sneddon: How do you know he was talking about the Bashir documentary.
Davellin Arvizo: Because he said, “The Bashir tape”. Well -- yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall what his attitude was towards that at the time that he said it, or his demeanor.
Davellin Arvizo: Kind of like upset about it; didn't want to see it.
Mr. Sneddon: At any point that night -- I've talked to you about you and your brothers. At any point while you were in Mr. Jackson's room that night, did your mother leave.
Davellin Arvizo: No. Well, yeah, at one point she did.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. When was that.
Davellin Arvizo: During the Bashir taping.
Mr. Sneddon: How do you know it was during the Bashir taping.
Davellin Arvizo: Because Mr. Jackson already had said for us not to watch it.
Mr. Sneddon: And then she left.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, she went downstairs to our room.
Mr. Sneddon: And what happened. When your mother left, did anybody else leave after that.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, they came and asked where she was. And then I told them that she was downstairs, because she had a headache. And they went down and got her.
Mr. Sneddon: And she came back up to the room.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember who it was specifically who went to get her.
Davellin Arvizo: I think it was Frank.
Mr. Sneddon: Mr. Tyson.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.

Mr. Sneddon: Did it happen on more than one occasion.
Davellin Arvizo: My grandma had called us and said there was media at her house, but other -- to the apartment, no.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, one last thing, and then we'll get back on the plane there in Miami. Your senior year in high school, where did you go to high school.
Davellin Arvizo: Mountain View High School.
Mr. Sneddon: What community is Mountain View High School located.
Davellin Arvizo: In El Monte.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did you live while you were going to Mountain View High School.
Davellin Arvizo: With my grandmother.
Mr. Sneddon: And they live in where.
Davellin Arvizo: El Monte.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, after you graduated from high school, where did you -- where did you live. With your grandparents or somebody else.
Davellin Arvizo: We went back to live with my parents.
Mr. Sneddon: With your parents meaning.
Davellin Arvizo: Jay Jackson and my mom.
Mr. Sneddon: Have you lived there continuously since that time.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: How would you describe your relationship with your stepfather.
Davellin Arvizo: Very nice relationship. Very, very loving. I love him a lot.
The Court: Mr. Sneddon. This is a good place to interrupt. I'm not sure if it's catching up. It's going back through the -- this morning.
The Reporter: It will eventually catch up.
Mr. Sanger: It's doing the same for us, if that's of any consolation.
Mr. Zonen: Us too.
The Court: That's no consolation. I'd like to wait a minute, if we could, so we catch up. (Brief interruption.)
The Court: All right. I think we can go forward now.
Mr. Sneddon: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. We're going to go back now and we're going to start talking about the part of Miami where you're flying, you're getting on a plane in Miami. Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you told us who was on the plane before.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, I want to ask you something. Was there an incident that occurred before you guys got on the plane.
Davellin Arvizo: Like -- incident how.
Mr. Sneddon: Was your mother on the plane.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And was your mother supposed to be on the plane.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. What happened.
Davellin Arvizo: They didn't want my mom to go on the flight, on the same flight that we were on.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: Were you present when your mom was having a discussion about who was going to go on the plane.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, she was on the phone.
Mr. Sneddon: She was on the phone.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And who else was present.
Davellin Arvizo: I think my brothers were. But it was in our room, but it's when we were getting ready to leave.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know who she was on the phone with.
Davellin Arvizo: Probably --
Mr. Sneddon: To your knowledge, without --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection.
Mr. Sneddon: Not something that somebody told you, but to your knowledge.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Sneddon: And how long did that discussion take.
Davellin Arvizo: They were on the phone for like ten minutes.
Mr. Sneddon: And at the end of that conversation, did your mom get on the plane with you.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Was -- were any people identified to you as security guards on that plane when it left.
Davellin Arvizo: When it left, there was no security guards on the plane.
Mr. Sneddon: On the plane -- where -- let's just do it this way: You're on the plane. Where are you seated on the plane in relationship to your brother Gavin.
Davellin Arvizo: Right across from him.
Mr. Sneddon: And who's sitting next to you, if anyone.
Davellin Arvizo: Paris is.
Mr. Sneddon: Paris.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to the defendant in this case, Mr. Jackson, where is he.
Davellin Arvizo: He's sitting next to Gavin.
Mr. Sneddon: And is there anything in between you and Paris and Gavin and the defendant.
Davellin Arvizo: We were sitting at, like, a dining room -- like a little table. There were, like, cupholders and stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the flight, during this flight, did you at any time see Gavin drinking anything.
Davellin Arvizo: He had a Diet Coke can.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know where he got it from.
Davellin Arvizo: Mr. Jackson passed it to him.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see him actually drink from the can.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember on how many occasions.
Davellin Arvizo: They were sipping it back and forth.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when they were sipping this -- what kind of a can was it.
Davellin Arvizo: A Diet Coke can.
Mr. Sneddon: When they were sipping this Diet Coke can, passing it back and forth, was there anything else going on between your brother Gavin and the defendant in this case, Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Overruled.
Davellin Arvizo: They were whispering.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry.
Davellin Arvizo: They were whispering back and forth.
Mr. Sneddon: At any time during the time that they were whispering back and forth, did you see Mr. Jackson do anything.
Davellin Arvizo: He would pass the Diet Coke, they would whisper, and then at one point Mr. Jackson took off his watch and gave it to Gavin.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see Mr. Jackson do that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, when he took the watch off and gave it to Gavin, whether he said anything to him at that time.
Davellin Arvizo: He was whispering in his ear and then Gavin put it on.
Mr. Sneddon: During the course of this flight, did you see Mr. Jackson give Gavin anything else.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What.
Davellin Arvizo: The jacket he had on.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you describe the jacket.
Davellin Arvizo: It's black and it's sparkly on the back.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, do you recall how long the plane ride took from, say, Miami to where you eventually landed.
Davellin Arvizo: Six, seven hours.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you -- were you awake during the whole trip.
Davellin Arvizo: No, I fell asleep at one point.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, your brother Star was on the plane; is that correct.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was your brother Star located on the plane.
Davellin Arvizo: There was a bench behind Mr. Jackson and Gavin. I'm -- not exactly behind, but like to the back, my left-hand side, there was a bench. And he would go from right there into a chair that was right in front of them. He would go back and forth.
Mr. Sneddon: So this was a plane you could get up and move around on.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where was your mom.
Davellin Arvizo: My mom was sitting behind me in one of the four chairs that's behind us.
Mr. Sneddon: During the time that you were on this plane, did you see whether or not the plane had any kind of a telephone on it.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where was the telephone located.
Davellin Arvizo: Right on my right-hand side, on the wall.
Mr. Sneddon: And during the time of this ride on the plane, did you see -- can you tell us whether or not that telephone was ever used.
Davellin Arvizo: I saw Gavin use it once. He was calling one of his friends.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Did you see that on any other occasions.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Excuse me just a moment, Your Honor. I have an exhibit. This will be 339, I believe, for identification purposes. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I'm going to hand you People's Exhibit No. 339 and ask you if you recognize that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what that is.
Davellin Arvizo: The -- how -- the plane, the private jet.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that the interior.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I'm going to hand you this pen. And just hang on to that for a second. Does that diagram accurately represent the interior of the plane as you recall it.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: I move that it be admitted into evidence, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I didn't hear.
The Court: It's okay. He moved that exhibit into evidence. She identified it.
Mr. Mesereau: There's still a foundational problem, Your Honor, as to whether that is actually an accurate depiction of the interior of that plane. I don't think the foundation has been laid.
The Court: I'll admit it. I think that's a subject of cross-examination.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. We're going to display something up on the Elmo, Your Honor. And what we're going to display is 339.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you have the exhibit in front of you, okay. What I want you to do is, I want you to take a felt tip pen, if you would, and I want you to put your initials in the seat in which you were located. Well, first of all, let me do this. Take that light, the black thing with the light, okay, and show the ladies and gentlemen of the jury where you were seated.
Davellin Arvizo: Right there.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And where was your brother Gavin.
Davellin Arvizo: Right there.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was the defendant.
Davellin Arvizo: Right here.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was Paris.
Davellin Arvizo: Right here.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, what I want you to do is on the exhibit that you have in front of you, I want you to take that red pen I gave you, and I want you to put your initials in your seat. Okay. What did you put.
Davellin Arvizo: “DA”.
Mr. Sneddon: That figures. Now, would you please put the initials for your brother in the seat that he was in on Exhibit 339. And then put just like an “MJ” for where Mr. Jackson was sitting. And a “PJ” for where Paris was sitting. Now, would you show the ladies and gentlemen of the jury with the light again, if you would, where your mother was sitting on the plane.
Davellin Arvizo: She was sitting in one of these four seats.
Mr. Sneddon: So you're not sure which one of those four.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: So why don't you just put your mother's initials right in the middle on the diagram. And you put a what.
Davellin Arvizo: “JJ”. “JJ”.
Mr. Sneddon: “JJ”.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, that's my mom's initials.
Mr. Sneddon: Oh, Janet Jackson. You threw me for a second. Way ahead of me. All right. Now, your brother Star, when the plane took off, do you recall where he was.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you show the ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
Davellin Arvizo: He was either sitting right here or he would go to this seat.
Mr. Sneddon: So he moved back and forth between those seats. All right. The two seats that you said he moved back and forth between, would you put his initials in those seats on the Exhibit 339. Would you put them in both of them. Now, I want to direct your attention to where you believed that you saw the telephone. Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you point that out to the jury.
Davellin Arvizo: Right here.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And would you put -- you can put -- on the white area, put “TFC”, and then the arrow to where it was located on the exhibit. Would you do that. Good. Thank you. Now, on the exhibit that looks like a blue series of chairs, do you see that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What is that.
Davellin Arvizo: That's like a couch.
Mr. Sneddon: And you told us that one of those seats was occupied from time to time by your brother Star.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Who, if anyone, occupied the other seat.
Davellin Arvizo: Aldo and Marie Nicole were sitting in that area, too.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember which seats they were in.
Davellin Arvizo: No, they would switch around.
Mr. Sneddon: Why don't you just go ahead and put their initials, just Aldo and Marie Nicole, in those two seats, just -- and an arrow back and forth. How's that. Okay. Now, you told us -- who else was on the plane.
Davellin Arvizo: Mr. Jackson's doctor and the two nannies.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know the doctor's name.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know where he was seated.
Davellin Arvizo: He was in one of the four chairs.
Mr. Sneddon: Show us.
Davellin Arvizo: In one of these chairs.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Who else was up in that four-chair area besides your mother and this doctor.
Davellin Arvizo: The two nannies.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. So why don't you just put “Doctor”, just put a “DR”, just -- and “2-nannies”. Okay. Now, if we could just move the exhibit a little bit farther to the right, so it shows all the way to the front, or all the way to the end. Okay. Now, from this particular exhibit, 339, the one that's in front of you, looking at the far left-hand part of the exhibit that's on the board above you, do you see that. What end of the plane is that.
Davellin Arvizo: This is the back of the plane.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Could you just write in the white space above it “back” and put an arrow down to that. Can you tell us, what are the areas depicted in this particular part of Exhibit 339.
Davellin Arvizo: This is the bathroom. There was an area back -- I don't know. It was an area back here where the flight attendant would make the food and stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: And then the luggage is way in the back.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. So show us the bathroom again.
Davellin Arvizo: Right here.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. So that little white box that's on the screen there, do you see the little white box. Is that part of the bathroom, on the lower part.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Why don't you write “BR” in there. Okay. We're going to slide the Exhibit 339 all the way to the other end. Okay. So I take it that would be the front part of the plane.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: So could we just write “front” on there, if you would. Do you remember where the door to the plane is where you got on.
Davellin Arvizo: It's right there.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Do you want to write “door” in that space. All right. I think we're done with that exhibit. Thank you. May I have a moment, Your Honor. We can turn the lights back on. All right. Now, that exhibit that you put in front of you, that's 339, the plane.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you please just write your name on it. Because we're going to have several of those, and we want to make sure that we have your name on it. Thank you. Now, one other thing that I think that I probably forgot to ask you that needs to be asked: You told the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that your brother had been diagnosed with cancer.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And that he had had a battle with cancer, and had been going to the hospital and out of the hospital from time to time.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: How long was it before -- how long did it last. How long did that illness last.
Davellin Arvizo: A year.
Mr. Sneddon: And what happened at the end of the year.
Davellin Arvizo: He was in remission. There was no more -- they couldn't find no more cancer cells.
Mr. Sneddon: So it was a year from when it first happened to when it went into remission.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you peg that for us in terms of where you were in your schooling when he actually went into remission.
Davellin Arvizo: My sophomore year.
Mr. Sneddon: Was your father still in the house at the time that he -- that Gavin -- Gavin went into remission.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: He was already gone.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes. He had left the month before.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry.
Davellin Arvizo: He had left the month before.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Let's move back to where we were chronologically. And we're talking about on the plane coming from Miami. Now, when the plane landed, did you know where you were.
Davellin Arvizo: We were back in -- near the Neverland Ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you got off the plane, where did you go.
Davellin Arvizo: We got picked up in a limo and we got took to the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, could you tell us, when you got off the plane and you got into the limo, was it night or day.
Davellin Arvizo: It was night.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember about what time it was.
Davellin Arvizo: No. It was just pitch black.
Mr. Sneddon: So you got into the limo. And were there any stops between the airport and the ranch, to your knowledge.
Davellin Arvizo: No. No.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you got to the ranch, where did you go.
Davellin Arvizo: I went to the guest room.
Mr. Sneddon: Was it the same one you were in before or a different one.
Davellin Arvizo: It was the same one.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you know -- did you go in your mom's room, wherever your mom was staying.
Davellin Arvizo: Not that night. Just to say goodnight, but not to stay there.
Mr. Sneddon: So you went in there to say goodnight.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Where was she staying.
Davellin Arvizo: She was staying next to me.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. In the guest quarters.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to your brothers, did you see where they went when you got back to the ranch and got out of the limo.
Davellin Arvizo: I just seen -- I saw them run off with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: I couldn't hear you.
Davellin Arvizo: I just saw them run off with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see in what direction they took off.
Davellin Arvizo: Towards the main house.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you -- how far did you see them go before you went and did something else.
Davellin Arvizo: I just saw them go into the main house.
Mr. Sneddon: So you actually saw them go into the house.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see them at all the rest of that night.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, while you were at the ranch now, had you missed school.
Davellin Arvizo: No, because I was off track at that time.
Mr. Sneddon: What does that mean.
Davellin Arvizo: I go to -- at that time I was on a year-round school. So I would go to school for three months; get three months off; and go to school for three months.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you told us that when you were -- when you heard about the trip to Miami, you called your mom on a pay phone.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, it was like a couple days before the vacation.
Mr. Sneddon: But were you in school at that time.
Davellin Arvizo: I was in summer -- in like -- they have two intersessions. One like summer school, but they had it during the winter.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: And I think I was -- I had some classes. That's why I was at school.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And were your brothers, to your knowledge, in school.
Davellin Arvizo: I think they were.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember which school they were going to at this time. By “this time”, I mean when you're at Neverland Valley Ranch after you've come back from Miami.
Davellin Arvizo: I think they were in Hollenbeck. But I couldn't remember. I don't remember really.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. At any time after you arrived back at the ranch that night, did the person you described previously as Dieter, the one you met in Miami at the hotel --
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- did you ever see him on the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Later on.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. How many days later was it.
Davellin Arvizo: I think it was the next day or the following day.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever see the person that you named as Ronald and identified in the photograph, did you see that person come to the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember when that was.
Davellin Arvizo: Around the same time as Dieter.
Mr. Sneddon: And during the time that you got to the ranch, and when these two individuals arrived at the ranch, did you know whether or not they were staying at the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. I think so. Because they were there all day from -- I'd see them.
Mr. Sneddon: When you saw them, can you tell us whether or not you ever saw them with Mr. Jackson.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: On how many occasions during those first days.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, anytime I'd really come into the main house --
Mr. Sneddon: You have to speak up.
Davellin Arvizo: Anytime I really, like, passed by the main house, I would see them occasionally talking with each other. But I really don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: It was a couple of times.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever see them meeting and talking in any other places on the location there.
Davellin Arvizo: No, not that I remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: Like later on they would meet in the guest quarters, but -- like Mr. Jackson and Ronald. But not at the beginning.
Mr. Sneddon: I couldn't hear that.
Davellin Arvizo: Like later on --
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: -- like Mr. Jackson and Ronald would meet in the guest quarters. But other than that, no.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. That was later on, though.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you personally have any contact with the people -- let's say Dieter first. Let's start with the person you described as Dieter. Did you ever have any conversations with him.
Davellin Arvizo: Couple times.
Mr. Sneddon: What were the subjects of the conversations.
Davellin Arvizo: On the rebuttal film and us going to Brazil.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's talk about the rebuttal film, all right. What did Dieter tell you about the rebuttal film. And first of all, let's go back. Where did -- excuse me. Where did that conversation take place.
Davellin Arvizo: There was one conversation in one of the guest quarters with me and my mom and my brothers.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Anybody else present.
Davellin Arvizo: No, it was just Dieter and us.
Mr. Sneddon: And how many days do you think it was that you'd been there before that conversation occurred.
Davellin Arvizo: Less than a week. Three days, four days.
Mr. Sneddon: And what was the subject matter of the conversation.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Sneddon: It's offered under 223.
The Court: I'll accept it conditionally. Excuse me. I'll accept the testimony conditionally under the instructions I gave you earlier.
Mr. Sneddon: Go ahead.
Davellin Arvizo: It was about the watch.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. What about the watch.
Davellin Arvizo: He wanted it back.
Mr. Sneddon: Who wanted it back.
Davellin Arvizo: Dieter wanted it back from Gavin.
Mr. Sneddon: And what was said.
Davellin Arvizo: That he wanted it back; that he could put it in a safe and take care of it for him and he might lose it, and he just wanted it back.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And did he get it back.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Why.
Davellin Arvizo: Gavin didn't want to give it to him.
Mr. Sneddon: What was your mother's attitude towards that.
Davellin Arvizo: Just -- she didn't see no point in it. She just -- whatever Gavin wanted.
Mr. Sneddon: Now -- I got it. It's all right. Now, you told us that the other conversations that you had with this gentleman Dieter involved the rebuttal film.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, when you talk about a rebuttal film, what do you mean by that.
Davellin Arvizo: They said they wanted to do another video, and they wanted it to just be of us.
Mr. Sneddon: Who's “they”.
Davellin Arvizo: Dieter and Frank talked about it.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when -- let's talk about Dieter first of all, okay. When did you have a conversation with Dieter about this rebuttal film.
Davellin Arvizo: I think it was in -- near, like, the kitchen area. In that area. Like in the sitting area.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And do you recall how long you'd been at the ranch before -- when that conversation took place.
Davellin Arvizo: It was after the watch incident, so five days or so. I think.
Mr. Sneddon: What did he say about -- what did he say to you about the rebuttal.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Sneddon: Offered for the same purpose, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. I'll accept it conditionally.
Mr. Sneddon: Go ahead.
Davellin Arvizo: It was just -- we were supposed to say nice things about him and just -- and he offered us -- to give us a paper.
Mr. Sneddon: A paper. What do you mean by “a paper”.
Davellin Arvizo: It was kind of like a script, just of things to say.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you read it.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember what was on it.
Davellin Arvizo: Just nice things of Mr. Jackson, and that's it.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at some point in time after you arrived at the ranch from Miami, and you're on the ranch, okay --
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- did you leave.
Davellin Arvizo: From --
Mr. Sneddon: From Neverland. I'm not asking you how long. I'm just asking did you leave.
Davellin Arvizo: We left at -- just to do the rebuttal.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: And there was -- that's all I remember, yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember meeting a man at the ranch by the name of Jesus.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Who is Jesus.
Davellin Arvizo: He's one of the security guards there or just one of the head people around the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you ever leave the ranch with Jesus.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. Now I remember, yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall with regard to that particular incident -- between the time that you arrived at the ranch at Neverland and the time that you left with Jesus, okay. We're talking about that time.
Davellin Arvizo: (Nods head up and down.)
Mr. Sneddon: Where did your mother stay on the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: She stood in the guest quarters.
Mr. Sneddon: And could you tell us, under your personal observations and opinion, did your mother come out of the room very often.
Davellin Arvizo: Never.
Mr. Sneddon: Why.
Davellin Arvizo: She just never came out, and then --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Calls for speculation; hearsay. And no foundation.
Mr. Sneddon: Let me see if I can go back and cure it a little bit, Judge. I think I can do that without any problem.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. During the time that you got from Miami and you got to the ranch --
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- to the time that you left with Jesus, okay --
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- where were your brothers.
Davellin Arvizo: They were running around with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see much of them.
Davellin Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Sneddon: So the only person that you know on the ranch was your mother.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you spend time with your mother.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And where did you spend time with your mother.
Davellin Arvizo: In her room.
Mr. Sneddon: And your room was next door to your mother's room.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: So, do you have an opinion with regard to how much your mother came out of her room.
Davellin Arvizo: Hardly never. Not really at all.
Mr. Sneddon: During the time that you were there from -- you got back from Miami and before you left with Jesus - okay. - how long was that; do you recall.
Davellin Arvizo: I'm sorry, repeat the question. I was thinking about me and my mom in the room.
Mr. Sneddon: Did I forget to ask you something about you and your mom.
Davellin Arvizo: No, just thinking about the whole situation. Can you repeat the question.
Mr. Sneddon: Sure. From the time you arrived at the ranch till the time you left with Jesus, okay, how many days do you think that was.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember. Close to a week or less. I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: It had been a while, though.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, had -- can you describe your mother's demeanor and attitude during the time that she was at the ranch between the time you got there and the time you left with Jesus.
Davellin Arvizo: She seemed kind of worried and just didn't really understand the whole situation, what was really going on. And she was kind of scared.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when -- when you left with Jesus, do you remember what time of the night or day it was that you left.
Davellin Arvizo: It was night.
Mr. Sneddon: How do you know that.
Davellin Arvizo: Because it was really dark out.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember the circumstances under which you left.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, we were scared and we just --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay; foundation; calls for speculation.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Sneddon: Go ahead.
Davellin Arvizo: We were kind of scared and we just really didn't -- the way the conversations with Dieter went, they were real aggressive and just -- we were scared, so -- of course Gavin didn't want to leave. But my mom and me, mainly my mom wanted to get us out of there.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And then do you recall how Mr. Salas -- I'm sorry, how Jesus got involved in this.
Davellin Arvizo: My mom asked him to take us to home.
Mr. Sneddon: Were you present when she did that.
Davellin Arvizo: Not that I remember.
Mr. Sneddon: So at some point you were told what, by your mom.
Davellin Arvizo: By my mom, that we were leaving.
Mr. Sneddon: And you gathered up your stuff, I take it.
Davellin Arvizo: Some little things. Not really. We just really wanted to get out of there.
Mr. Sneddon: And then what did you do.
Davellin Arvizo: We left.
Mr. Sneddon: And who went.
Davellin Arvizo: Jesus, me, my brothers and my mom.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, I don't want you to speak for anybody else, okay. I want you to speak for yourself. Why was it that you felt that you were scared.
Davellin Arvizo: Just the whole situation. The whole secrecy. The -- just real aggressive. I was just scared. I didn't understand what was going on and why it was like this. I was just scared.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you -- during this time, when you first got to the ranch and before you left with Jesus, did you have any interaction with the defendant in this case, Mr. Jackson.
Davellin Arvizo: Just little interaction, yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And can you describe that.
Davellin Arvizo: Hi; a hug; there would be times where I'd walk in where Mr. Jackson and the boys and Aldo would be and just say hi and stuff like that. But I would leave immediately.
Mr. Sneddon: Why.
Davellin Arvizo: Because they would tell me, “Oh, don't you want to go do that”. And just felt uncomfortable, like if they didn't want me there.
Mr. Sneddon: So, just to fill in the rest of it for the jury, the people that you've identified in those photographs as Aldo and Marie Nicole, did they go to the ranch at the same time that you folks did. From the limo, from the plane, to the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And they were there.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you know where Marie Nicole was staying.
Davellin Arvizo: She stood in the main house.
Mr. Sneddon: And how do you know that.
Davellin Arvizo: Because we would talk and stuff. And then I stood in the room with her at one time, just sitting and talking.
Mr. Sneddon: To your knowledge, at any time did the boys come back and stay in the guest cottage.
Davellin Arvizo: One time Star did.
Mr. Sneddon: Between the time that you arrived from Miami till the time you left with Jesus, did the boys come back and stay in the guest cottage.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: To your knowledge, based upon what you saw and observed, did you ever see the boys stay the night in the guest cottage before you left with Jesus.
Mr. Mesereau: Same objection; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Davellin Arvizo: Um, I think that was after, after we came back.
Mr. Sneddon: What was after.
Davellin Arvizo: The incident with Star coming to sleep in the room. It was after we had come back.
Mr. Sneddon: Come back from.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't know where it was placed. All I know, there was one incident Star came and slept with me in the room.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. So there was one time.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Can you tell us whether or not, from your own personal observation -- strike that. Did you see your mother interact with Dieter and Ronald.
Davellin Arvizo: There was one incidence I saw him coming out of my mom's room, but -- I don't remember. She would tell me --
Mr. Sneddon: Don't tell us what she said.
Davellin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: It's not your fault.
Davellin Arvizo: From what I saw, no.
Mr. Sneddon: You weren't present during those conversations.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: But there were occasions when you saw Dieter and Ronald coming out of your mom's room.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you go into -- don't tell us what she said. But after that, did you go in to see her right away.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you tell us whether or not she was upset.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes. She seemed upset.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. I'll withdraw the objection.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you left with Jesus, do you remember where you were taken.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where were you taken.
Davellin Arvizo: To my grandmother's house.
Mr. Sneddon: And was your grandmother still living in El Monte.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, after -- I'm sorry. Now, after you got to -- got to El Monte, do you remember what time it was.
Davellin Arvizo: It was night.
Mr. Sneddon: Still night.
Davellin Arvizo: Uh-huh.
Mr. Sneddon: So that night, did you spend the night there with your grandparents.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: At this point, was -- to your knowledge, was your mother still seeing Major Jackson.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And, in fact -- let me put it this way: At the point before you left for Miami, okay, for the trip to Miami, was she still seeing Major Jackson.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: At that point in time, was your mother staying at the Soto Street address or with Major Jackson.
Davellin Arvizo: Um --
Mr. Sneddon: If you know.
Davellin Arvizo: At the very beginning we were still staying at the Soto apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: And then would go sleep over at his house, but we were still living at the Soto apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: When you got back from Neverland Ranch, you're back at your grandparents' place, all right. Now, did you remain at your grandparents' or did you go somewhere else.
Davellin Arvizo: We went to Jay Jackson's house.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember how many days you were there.
Davellin Arvizo: We didn't sleep over that night.
Mr. Sneddon: How about the next night.
Davellin Arvizo: I think that's the day that the ladies came over from -- the social workers.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you ever remember --
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me.
The Court: She's not speaking loud enough. You need to speak up.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
The Court: Would you like the answer read back.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please, Your Honor. Thank you.
The Court: Please.
The Court Reporter: I think that's the day that the ladies came over from -- the social workers.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Do you remember an incident at Jay Jackson's apartment where a private investigator came to the apartment.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Was that before or after the time you went to talk to the social workers.
Davellin Arvizo: This was before.
Mr. Sneddon: Was it before -- well, was it after you left the ranch with Mr. Jesus.
Davellin Arvizo: I think it was after. I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember what day of the week it was.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Describe the meeting to us, if you would.
Davellin Arvizo: Mr. Miller came in and --
Mr. Sneddon: You knew his name.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. What was it.
Davellin Arvizo: Mr. Bradley Miller.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Go ahead.
Davellin Arvizo: Mr. Miller -- we all sat on the -- Jay's couch, and -- me and my mom and my brothers and Jay and Mr. Miller. And Mr. Miller just told us to say what we thought about our father and say how we felt about Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: Did -- did you remain during the entire time that Mr. Miller was there.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: To your knowledge, did you ever see a tape-recorder.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where was the tape-recorder.
Davellin Arvizo: It was placed on the glass table.
Mr. Sneddon: Whose tape-recorder was that.
Davellin Arvizo: That was Mr. Miller's.
Mr. Sneddon: And during the course of the conversations between you and Mr. Miller, did he ever turn it off.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember how many times he did that.
Davellin Arvizo: It was several times. But he would turn it off and say “Um, that's not necessary. You don't need to talk about that. Let's start over. I want to talk about this now”, and he would restart the tape.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection.
The Court: Just a moment. Overruled. Go ahead. Overruled.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Go ahead.
Davellin Arvizo: He would start to rewind it and say, “That's” -- “You don't need to say that”.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember how long the conversation with Mr. Miller lasted.
Davellin Arvizo: Half an hour, I think.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at some point after this tape-recorded conversation with this person you knew as Mr. Miller -- okay. -- did you go back to the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And who did you go back to the ranch with.
Davellin Arvizo: My brothers and my mom.
Mr. Sneddon: And how did you get back to the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Someone came and picked us up.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, do you remember the name of the person who picked you up.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember who it was.
Mr. Sneddon: When you were picked up, do you remember where you were when you got picked up.
Davellin Arvizo: At Jay's apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: You're going to have to speak up.
Davellin Arvizo: At Jay's apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: That's great. Just keep it right like that. Okay. At Jay's apartment. And where did you go.
Davellin Arvizo: To Neverland Ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there any stops made between the point you left Major Jackson's place and you got to the ranch, to your knowledge or recollection.
Davellin Arvizo: I think there was a point that we stopped at Jamie's, The Laugh Factory.
Mr. Sneddon: You have to --
Davellin Arvizo: I think that was the point that we stopped at The Laugh Factory.
Mr. Sneddon: You remember there was an incident that you stopped at The Laugh Factory.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. You got back to the ranch at some point, correct.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you got back to the ranch, did you see anybody at the ranch that you recognized that had been there before, when you first got there.
Davellin Arvizo: Frank was there. And I met Vinnie.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you tell us whether or not Dieter was there.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't think he was. I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: When you guys got back to the ranch on this occasion, did your mother stay with you.
Davellin Arvizo: I think she did. I'm trying to place where I was at.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Take a second and place it, okay.
Davellin Arvizo: Okay. I think so. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: Excuse me just a second, Your Honor. It will take me just a second, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: Let me ask you something else while I'm looking for this. Let's go back just a moment in time. At the time you were at the ranch before you left with Mr. Salas, with Jose -- Jesus, did you hear anybody threaten you or any member of your family.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Davellin Arvizo: Um --
The Court: Just a moment. He'll have to ask you another question.
Davellin Arvizo: Oh.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, can you tell us whether or not you personally ever received any comments from somebody that scared you.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Mr. Sneddon: It's not a leading question. It's an open-ended question.
The Court: All right. Overruled.
Davellin Arvizo: There was one point that Frank had told us that there was death threats on us.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Okay. Do you remember a point in time where you -- let me ask this question: Have you ever been to the residence of Hamid Moslehi.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what was going on when you went to his house. Why did you go there.
Davellin Arvizo: That's where we did the rebuttal at.
Mr. Sneddon: And where had you been prior to going to his house.
Davellin Arvizo: The ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: And who was at the ranch at that time.
Davellin Arvizo: Frank -- no, Frank wasn't there. Vinnie was --
Mr. Sneddon: Let me ask it this way: How did you get from the ranch to his house.
Davellin Arvizo: Hamid came and picked us up.
Mr. Sneddon: Who did.
Davellin Arvizo: Hamid.
Mr. Sneddon: Who was in the car with you.
Davellin Arvizo: Me, my mom and my brothers.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And you went to where.
Davellin Arvizo: To his house.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And what was the -- what was the -- why were you there.
Davellin Arvizo: To do the rebuttal film.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, before you left the ranch that particular night, did you have a conversation with anybody about the film.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And who was that.
Davellin Arvizo: Dieter.
Mr. Sneddon: And what did Dieter tell you.
Davellin Arvizo: To say nice things.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Sneddon: Same purpose, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled.
Davellin Arvizo: To say nice things and to not talk about what goes on around the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry.
Davellin Arvizo: What goes on in the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: I didn't hear you. You're going to have to lean in there and talk --
Davellin Arvizo: To say nice things about Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: And you said something else.
Davellin Arvizo: And to not talk about what goes on in the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did this conversation take place.
Davellin Arvizo: I think it was the main house.
Mr. Sneddon: What -- what time was it when you left the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: It was night.
Mr. Sneddon: Was it dark outside.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. It was late night.
Mr. Sneddon: When you got to Hamid's house, who else was there.
Davellin Arvizo: Frank was there. Vinnie was there. And another male, younger male was there. And Bradley was there, Mr. Miller was there.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And that night, you eventually ended up in a video; is that correct.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: An interview.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember the name of the gentleman who actually did the interviewing.
Davellin Arvizo: No. I don't remember. He was a young male.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you describe him at all.
Davellin Arvizo: Thin face. White skin. He was young-looking. I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, before -- when you got to Mr. -- when you got to Hamid's house and before the filming took place, what were you doing. You personally, what were you doing. Where you were in the house.
Davellin Arvizo: In Hamid's house.
Mr. Sneddon: Yes.
Davellin Arvizo: Standing, facing the -- like the area where we filmed it.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see where your mother was in the house.
Davellin Arvizo: She was getting ready, like in the rest room, like --
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see your mom have any conversations with anybody.
Davellin Arvizo: Don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, who participated in the video.
Davellin Arvizo: Me, my mom and my brothers.
Mr. Sneddon: And how long did it last.
Davellin Arvizo: Very long time. We were there until, I think it was like 4:00 in the morning.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the interview -- I want you to speak for yourself, okay.
Davellin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Nobody else. During the interview, you were depicted at one point crying on the interview.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And why were you crying.
Davellin Arvizo: I was crying for my brother.
Mr. Sneddon: And why were you crying for your brother.
Davellin Arvizo: Because I was talking about things about him.
Mr. Sneddon: What was so upsetting about that.
Davellin Arvizo: Because Gavin had heard, like, people say that he was a faggot. And he would cry to me about that. And that hurt me, being his older sister. I wanted to protect him any way I can.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there any other things that you had heard that were upsetting you when you were talking on this video that made you cry.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Davellin Arvizo: The only thing that hurt me was things about my brother. There was no other reason to cry.
Mr. Sneddon: Didn't have anything to do with the defendant.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection.
The Court: Leading; sustained. The answer is stricken.
Mr. Sneddon: On the video, there are some statements with regard to Mr. Jackson helping -- helping you kids with homework. Do you remember those statements.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Mr. Sneddon: Just foundational, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: And hearsay.
The Court: Yeah, the objection is overruled. You may answer the question. I'll have it read back for you.
The Court Reporter: On the video, there are some statements with regard to Mr. Jackson helping -- helping you kids with homework. Do you remember those statements.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did Mr. Jackson ever help you with your homework.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Why are you smiling about that.
Davellin Arvizo: Becasue they took us out of school. There was no homework to help us with.
Mr. Sneddon: On the video, there are statements to the effect that Mr. Jackson was always there and you had a phone number where you could call him.
Davellin Arvizo: Uh-huh.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Sneddon: Was that statement true.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Why.
Davellin Arvizo: Because any phone number we had of him, that Gavin had of him, it would get disconnected.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me, Your Honor. I didn't quite hear that. Could I have it read back, please.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
The Court Reporter: Because any phone number we had of him, that Gavin had of him, it would get disconnected.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: At this particular point in time, with regard -- I only want you to speak for yourself, not for anybody else on that video. Okay. There are statements on that video that -- about people thinking of Mr. Jackson as family.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And as your dad.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Or daddy. Only speaking for yourself at this point in time, were those sentiments that you shared.
Davellin Arvizo: At the beginning, I found him like a close friend, but they started changing, my feelings towards him.
Mr. Sneddon: Why.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; nonresponsive.
The Court: Just a moment, please. Sustained; nonresponsive. Do you want the question read back.
Mr. Sneddon: I do, because I thought it was. Maybe I can look at it on the screen or read it back.
The Court Reporter: At the beginning, I found him like a close friend, but they started changing, my feelings towards him.
The Court: I sustained the objection. I didn't mean for you to read the answer.
The Reporter: I'm sorry.
The Court: The question was -- just rephrase the question so we can move on.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the statements about considering Michael Jackson, the defendant in this case, as “Daddy” or “Michael Daddy”, did you share those sentiments.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you share them at one time.
Davellin Arvizo: As a close friend, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Pardon.
Davellin Arvizo: I felt him as a close friend, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: When was that.
Davellin Arvizo: At the beginning.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, after this -- before you went up to the -- let's go back, now, before you've gone to the filming, okay. What was the atmosphere like for you personally at the ranch before the filming.
Davellin Arvizo: It was just a lot of secrecy. I was mainly by myself. Or other times I would go in my mom's room. Just -- I don't know. It was weird.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you have any interaction with Dieter, with the person you've identified as Dieter.
Davellin Arvizo: Not by myself, no.
Mr. Sneddon: Not by yourself. With you and others.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, with my brothers. Like he would pull us aside and talk to us and he would say, “I need to talk to you guys”.
Mr. Sneddon: And what would he talk to you about.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, during the time of the rebuttal film, he had told us about the death threats.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Sneddon: Same offer, Your Honor.
The Court: Conditionally admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Could you start over again about what Dieter told you. I don't know why I'm leaning into this. It's not on.
Davellin Arvizo: Other than the rebuttal film, it was that he told us there was death threats on us. And that's why we needed to leave.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. After the filming took place, where did you go. After you filmed at Hamid's house, where did you guys go that night.
Davellin Arvizo: Vinnie took us -- we stood at a hotel in Calabasas, I think. I think that was a period of time.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you remember a situation where you met with some social workers.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when did that occur. Before or after the rebuttal film.
Davellin Arvizo: That was after the rebuttal film.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember when in relationship to the rebuttal film, in terms of time.
Davellin Arvizo: After.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Bad question. How long after.
Davellin Arvizo: I think it was the next day. Next morning. That morning. Because we did -- we slept -- we didn't really get that much sleep, and then the ladies came that morning.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Where did the interview occur.
Davellin Arvizo: At Jay's house.
Mr. Sneddon: How did you get to Jay's.
Davellin Arvizo: Vinnie took us.
Mr. Sneddon: From where.
Davellin Arvizo: From Hamid's house.
Mr. Sneddon: From Hamid's house.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, were you a part of that conversation.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And prior to the time -- let's just try it this way. What time -- do you remember what time it was when everybody started to arrive at the apartment.
Davellin Arvizo: It was early. Late morning, early -- yeah, it was early afternoon.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. So who's at the apartment.
Davellin Arvizo: Um --
Mr. Sneddon: Before anybody arrives, who's at the apartment.
Davellin Arvizo: Jay -- no. Jay wasn't there. It was me, my mom, my brothers.
Mr. Sneddon: Who's the first person to arrive.
Davellin Arvizo: Azja is.
Mr. Sneddon: And Azja is who.
Davellin Arvizo: Chris Tucker's fiancee.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And when they arrived, did she bring somebody with her.
Davellin Arvizo: She brought her little baby, Dustin.
Mr. Sneddon: And who arrived after that.
Davellin Arvizo: One of Mr. Jackson's security bodyguards.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you describe this guy for us.
Davellin Arvizo: He was a big man, light skin, blondish-type hair, orange, I don't know. And he was just -- big arms.
Mr. Sneddon: Called “buffed”.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, had you ever met him before at this point in time.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And were you present when he actually came into the apartment.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you answer the door.
Davellin Arvizo: No. I think the door was open.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you hear him identify himself.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. He talked to my mom.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, did anybody else arrive before the social ladies -- social workers.
Davellin Arvizo: Other than Azja and the bodyguard, no.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, do you recall what happened when the social service ladies arrived.
Davellin Arvizo: They asked everybody to leave. They only wanted to talk to me and my mom and my brothers.
Mr. Sneddon: How many ladies came.
Davellin Arvizo: Three ladies.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember their names at all.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did anything happen before, or at the time that the ladies asked everybody to leave.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: What happened.
Davellin Arvizo: There was a time that Mr. Jackson's bodyguard pulled my mom aside into her room -- well, Jay's room.
Mr. Sneddon: So you couldn't hear what was going on inside that room.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you see anything.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, after he left --
Mr. Sneddon: No --
Davellin Arvizo: Not after he left, but like the door --
Mr. Sneddon: Let me rephrase the question. At that time, when your mother and the bodyguard walked into the bedroom, could you see anything at that point in time.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, later, did you go into that bedroom.
Davellin Arvizo: Later I could see into the bedroom.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And what did you see.
Davellin Arvizo: There was, like, a black little square thing on the bed. And I saw my mom grab it and put it on top -- inside the closet, on top.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, did -- were there any other things that occurred before you started your interview with the ladies.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see a video played at any time.
Davellin Arvizo: Not that I remember.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Tell us what happened during the interview. Who's present during the interview.
Davellin Arvizo: Me, my mom and my brothers and the three ladies.
Mr. Sneddon: And were you interviewed all at the same time or at separate times.
Davellin Arvizo: All together.
Mr. Sneddon: And how did that occur.
Davellin Arvizo: They just asked us what were the sleeping arrangements, how we felt about Mr. Jackson, and that's what I remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember what you said during that time.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Were you present during the entire conversation. All of you stayed there the whole time.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, how long did that conversation take.
Davellin Arvizo: About 30 minutes. It wasn't that long.
Mr. Sneddon: And you guys -- when I say “you guys”, you and your brothers and your sister and your mother -- all remained in the same room through the entire conversation.
Davellin Arvizo: Me and my brothers and my mom, yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah, your sister. I apologize. Now, after that conversation with the social ladies - all right - where did you go.
Davellin Arvizo: Azja took us back to the ranch, because --
Mr. Sneddon: Took “us”. Who is “us”.
Davellin Arvizo: Me and my brothers. My mom stayed. But the bodyguard wanted to take us, but we asked Azja to take us.
Mr. Sneddon: So the bodyguard was still there when you guys finished the meeting.
Davellin Arvizo: Afterward. We didn't know where he went. And then he showed up afterwards. And we were, like, near Azja's car, and we were saying bye to her.
Mr. Sneddon: And where did your mother go, to your knowledge.
Davellin Arvizo: She stood there at Jay's apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: So you went back to the ranch, and did you stay there, that night, at the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I want to show some photographs at this point. All right. We've had a little break here. I'll just move this over. All right. You ready.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: I didn't want to start --
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: The photograph you have in front of you is People's 19 for identification. Do you recognize that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry. Do you recognize that. Is that an accurate depiction of the person it represents.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Just flip that over, if you could. Now, turn that one sideways. No, the other one, the new one, so I can see the number. All right. That's People's 30 for identification. Do you recognize the person in this photograph.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that an accurate depiction of that person.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Why don't you turn that one over. And People's 23, do you recognize that person.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that an accurate depiction.
Davellin Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. He's a little different than when you saw him, right.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes, he's --
Mr. Sneddon: We'll go into that in just a second. But you recognize the person.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, the exhibit that you have there, that you just turned sideways, is 194. And do you recognize that.

Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that an accurate depiction.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Why don't you flip those back over in the same order, and I'm going to ask you some questions about them. And we're going to show some photographs.
Mr. Auchincloss: Can we go to Input 1, Your Honor. Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. The photograph that's on the board there -- first of all, I'm sorry, Your Honor, I apologize. I don't think there's any issue, move to admit these exhibits that have just been identified.
Mr. Mesereau: There's no objection.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry.
The Court: They're admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: What is the number of the exhibit that's on the board up there.
Davellin Arvizo: 19.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recognize that person.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Who is that.
Davellin Arvizo: Vinnie.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know Vinnie's last name.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Why don't you turn that one over, then. Do you remember where it was that you met Vinnie for the very first time.
Davellin Arvizo: It was at the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. The next -- what's the number of the next one in front of you.

Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And the next one. What number is that.
Davellin Arvizo: 23.
Mr. Sneddon: 23. And who is that.
Davellin Arvizo: That's Bradley Miller.
Mr. Sneddon: And you said that there's something about this photograph that's a little different than you remember about this individual at the time.
Davellin Arvizo: He's bigger. He's --
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry.
Davellin Arvizo: He's not as thin any -- he's not as thin. He's fuller in the face.
Mr. Sneddon: Now or then.
Davellin Arvizo: Now he's fuller in the face.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. So he looks skinnier in this photograph.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And where was Mr. Miller the first time that you met him; do you remember.
Davellin Arvizo: At Jay Jackson's apartment.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Why don't you turn that over and we'll get to the next one. All right. What's the number on that.
Davellin Arvizo: 194.
Mr. Sneddon: 194. Okay. And what is one -- not that one. Keep going. No, keep going. Okay. Is that 194 that's on the board there now.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to that particular photograph, what is that.
Davellin Arvizo: That's Hamid's house.
Mr. Sneddon: And --
Davellin Arvizo: That's where we filmed the rebuttal.
Mr. Sneddon: In that room.
Davellin Arvizo: In that area.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. What part of the area. Take the light. Take the light, that little meter, and show the ladies and gentlemen of the jury where it is.
Davellin Arvizo: Right here. They moved the couch and they put a screen behind us.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Hold on just a second. The next number that you have there.
Davellin Arvizo: It's 135.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. What's 135.
Davellin Arvizo: It's -- it's a -- it's the kitchen of the --
Mr. Sneddon: Tell us what's in the photograph.
Davellin Arvizo: It's the kitchen of the suite.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. All right. There we go. Now, do you recognize that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And you say, “The kitchen of the suite”. Where was this.
Davellin Arvizo: In Calabasas.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, let's -- that's all right. Just leave it up there. Now, did you stay in the room in Calabasas.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: How long were you there.
Davellin Arvizo: Couple days.
Mr. Sneddon: And who was -- who stayed in that room with you.
Davellin Arvizo: Me, my mom and my brothers.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there any other people staying at the same -- at the same time at that place.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Who.
Davellin Arvizo: Frank and Vinnie were. Well, at first it was Vinnie and then Frank came later on.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know, of your own personal knowledge, where their room was.
Davellin Arvizo: If you -- if you were to go out the door, there was a hallway of just rooms. And we couldn't get to the elevator unless we passed by their room.
Mr. Sneddon: And how -- what floor were you on.
Davellin Arvizo: I think it was the second or third floor.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Could you see the lobby from your -- outside your room.
Davellin Arvizo: If you walk out our door and go to the right, you can look down into the lobby.
Mr. Sneddon: When you went into the lobby area, did you see anybody you recognized.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Who was that.
Davellin Arvizo: It was one of the bodyguards.
Mr. Sneddon: Had you ever seen him before.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. I think he was the same one that gave us the -- he was the one that came during the ladies, with the meeting with the ladies from -- the social workers.
Mr. Sneddon: How often did you see him down in the lobby.
Davellin Arvizo: Anytime we looked down there.
Mr. Sneddon: And were there times when you would walk down the hall towards the elevator.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: You and your brothers.
Davellin Arvizo: And either -- they would have their door open if they were there.
Mr. Sneddon: Who's “they”.
Davellin Arvizo: Frank and Vinnie.
Mr. Sneddon: And what happened.
Davellin Arvizo: Just -- they would ask us, “Where are you going. What do you need to do. We'll get it. Just stay in your room”.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. The next photograph is -- do you recognize what's depicted in that photograph in front of you.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And what's the number.
Davellin Arvizo: 138. That's the room that I stood in.
Mr. Sneddon: The one that's on the board now is 138, correct.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: That's the one you stayed in.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you have a room all by yourself.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And then the next one is 125.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And that's -- what's 125.
Davellin Arvizo: That's the outside of the hotel.
Mr. Sneddon: And this is the hotel you stayed in.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you say this is the hotel you stayed in, it's the one that has the kitchen and the bed that you just talked about for the ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, I have one last photograph, Your Honor, I neglected to get marked, or identified. It's People's 29.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, do you recognize the person depicted in that photograph.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: People's 29 for identification.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to the person depicted in that particular photograph, is that an accurate depiction of the individual --
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- as you recall them.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Move that it be admitted, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: No objection, Your Honor.
The Court: It's admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Well, let's just put it this way: Who is that person.
Davellin Arvizo: Hamid.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. So that's the individual who picked you up and took you to his house.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And did the filming.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. There we go. So that's Hamid.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
The Bailiff: Judge, it's 1:15.
Mr. Sneddon: You can take that down. We're not going to ask any more questions on that.
Mr. Sneddon: Now I want to ask you some questions about your time at the ranch. Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: (Nods head up and down.)
Mr. Sneddon: During the time that you were staying at Neverland Ranch, did you ever see your brothers drink.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: On how many occasions.
Davellin Arvizo: Once.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, where was that when you saw it.
Davellin Arvizo: It was in the arcade. It was -- if you move a jukebox out of the way, it leads into a staircase. You go down the staircase, you make a right, there's another room and it has like sleeping bags and stuff. And you go into a little tiny room that's -- if you go into that room, make a right, there's a little tiny room and then that's the wine cellar.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: That's where Mr. Jackson, my brothers and Aldo were.
The Court: Would you like to take a break.
Mr. Sneddon: (Nods head up and down.)
The Court: All right. We'll take one.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, may I make a request of the Court.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: I understand there may be some difficulty with some of the people being able to hear the witness, and that if that's the case, maybe somebody -- if it's a lawyer or the jury, they could raise their hand and let us know so we can take action accordingly.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Thank you.
The Court: We're working on that problem. We're going to try and get a different mike for them.
Mr. Sneddon: That would be great. Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: I think where we left off was at Neverland Ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you had described to us the arcade and the cellar inside the arcade.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And I think what I asked you was, did you ever see your brothers drink at the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: On how many occasions.
Davellin Arvizo: Once.
Mr. Sneddon: And where.
Davellin Arvizo: It was in the wine cellar under the arcade.
Mr. Sneddon: And who else was present at that time.
Davellin Arvizo: Mr. Jackson, Gavin, Star and Aldo.
Mr. Sneddon: And what was going on when you -- did you walk down there with them, or did you join them there.
Davellin Arvizo: No, I had always seen people walking down there and they would come up with cups. But I never knew what was really down there until one time I walked in, and I just followed them when they were going down.
Mr. Sneddon: And this is the one time you're talking about.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. When you followed them in there, tell us what you saw.
Davellin Arvizo: When I walked into the wine cellar, I saw Mr. Jackson pouring wine into cups.
Mr. Sneddon: Into what.
Davellin Arvizo: Into cups.
Mr. Sneddon: Lean forward. I'm sorry, we got to do that. And how many cups.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't know. They were just cups. I don't remember how many there were.
Mr. Sneddon: Did everybody have one.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see anybody drink out of it.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Who drank.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, I saw Gavin, Star and Aldo drinking.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Anybody else.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, Mr. Jackson was drinking also.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you get offered something to drink.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you take it.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what was it.
Davellin Arvizo: It was wine.
Mr. Sneddon: What makes you think it was wine.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't know. Because it was clear and -- I don't know anything about liquor, so I don't know.
Mr. Sneddon: How did it taste.
Davellin Arvizo: Funny and, I don't know, weird.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Is that -- were there any other occasions while you were at the ranch that you saw your brothers drinking with Mr. Jackson.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there any other occasions at the ranch where you drank.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: How long were you downstairs in the wine cellar.
Davellin Arvizo: Ten minutes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did they all leave in ten minutes or did just you leave.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, we all went up.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did you go.
Davellin Arvizo: Back up to the arcade.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you take your cups with you, or did you leave them down there. Tell me what you did with your cup.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, I drank some, and then we went upstairs and I just left it on the counter.
Mr. Sneddon: A counter where.
Davellin Arvizo: In the -- in the arcade there's a counter, and you could just put it -- I just put it right there, and there's like a slushy machine there next to it.
Mr. Sneddon: A what.
Davellin Arvizo: A slushy machine next to it. It's kind of like -- I don't know how to describe it. It's just a counter, and then behind it there's like a fake cash register and stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: You put your cup there.
Davellin Arvizo: Uh-huh.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to the other individuals that were in the cellar, let's talk about them one by one. Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: You came up the stairs and put your cup on the counter there.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the defendant, Michael Jackson, did he come up the stairs at the same time as you.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, yeah, one after another.
Mr. Sneddon: And so everybody came upstairs.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Everybody at the same time.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Did -- when you all got upstairs and you were all back in this arcade area, what went on then.
Davellin Arvizo: They just listened -- well, we all listened to music and then they were playing some games.
Mr. Sneddon: By “they”, who do you mean.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, all of us. Gavin, Star, and then Mr. Jackson was listening to music.
Mr. Sneddon: Did Mr. Jackson stay there.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to the cups that everybody had downstairs, can you tell us whether anybody besides yourself brought their cups upstairs.
Davellin Arvizo: Everybody did.
Mr. Sneddon: When you were up there, did you see whether or not the people who brought their cups upstairs continued to use those cups and continued to drink.
Davellin Arvizo: I saw them sipping on it and drinking it. I don't know when they stopped or -- but from what I saw, they kept drinking it.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see your brother Gavin drinking upstairs.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And your brother Star.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And Aldo.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And how about the defendant.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: How long were you up there in the arcade with them that time.
Davellin Arvizo: Not very long because it was already night and I was tired, so I didn't stay there very long.
Mr. Sneddon: When you left the arcade that night, can you tell us whether or not anybody left with you.
Davellin Arvizo: No, they stood there.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry.
Davellin Arvizo: No, they stood there.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when -- when you came up the stairs out of the cellar --
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: -- okay. - is there a door to that cellar.
Davellin Arvizo: What do you mean, like “door”. Like when you walk down the stairs, I don't remember seeing a door. That's not the actual wine cellar. You got to go to the right, and there's a little room and that's where the wine bottles are at.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. When you came back up out of the wine cellar into the other room and up the stairs into the arcade - okay --.
Davellin Arvizo: They just put the juke box back.
Mr. Sneddon: Pardon.
Davellin Arvizo: They just put the juke box back. That's what blocks the staircase.
Mr. Sneddon: That's what I'm asking. You're way ahead of me. So there is a juke box up there.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And where did it go.
Davellin Arvizo: It blocks the staircase.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And did they put it back.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember who put it back.
Davellin Arvizo: No. I don't remember. I just remember it got put back.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the time that you were at Neverland Valley Ranch, did you ever go into Mr. Jackson's bedroom.
Davellin Arvizo: During the stay at Neverland Ranch, yes, I did once.
Mr. Sneddon: How many times.
Davellin Arvizo: Once.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember when it was that you went into his bedroom, in terms of how long you'd been there once you got back from Miami.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Misstates the evidence; leading question.
The Court: Sustained as to misstates the evidence. Just rephrase it.
Mr. Sneddon: You told the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that you had been in Mr. Jackson's bedroom on one occasion.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: This is at the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. When, in point in time, was it that you went into his bedroom. Was it in the daytime or in the nighttime.
Davellin Arvizo: It was in the nighttime.
Mr. Sneddon: And was it before -- was it after you arrived back from Miami.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: So it was during that time frame.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, would you tell us the circumstances under which you got into Mr. Jackson's bedroom.
Davellin Arvizo: I went after the boys, because there's no way I could get into the room unless it was after them.
Mr. Sneddon: Why is that.
Davellin Arvizo: Because there's a code to get into his room.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you have the code.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And you said the boys went -- you followed the boys.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Was there anybody with the boys.
Davellin Arvizo: Aldo was there, I think. I think Mr. Jackson was already in the room. I'm not sure.
Mr. Sneddon: So you followed them into the room, in any case.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Describe what you saw when you got into the room.
Davellin Arvizo: There's a couch.
Mr. Sneddon: Lean into the mike. Nice and loud, please.
Davellin Arvizo: There's a couch there. There's a music thing. There's a little game that -- that's all I remember. And then if you go straight back, there's his bathroom, and then right up next to the door of the bathroom there's, like, a desk and it has a phone on there.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you followed the boys into the room, what part of the room did you go into at first.
Davellin Arvizo: Just that front area. I guess it's like a living-room-type.
Mr. Sneddon: And how long were you there.
Davellin Arvizo: Ten minutes. Not that long.
Mr. Sneddon: And Mr. Jackson was there.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. I don't remember. I just remember us like sitting and me looking around, like, because I'd never been in there before.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Did you ever go upstairs.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes. I went upstairs after.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you got upstairs, describe the upstairs to me.
Davellin Arvizo: There's a bed in the middle and then there's a little nightstand. There's a bunch of figurines. When you first walk up the stairs, like, a bunch of like toys and like figurines right here. And then there's a screen that can be pulled down to watch movies. That's all I remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember whether the screen was down or up at the time you went in.
Davellin Arvizo: I think it was down already.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, who was in the bedroom.
Davellin Arvizo: Mr. Jackson, Gavin, Star, Aldo and me.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Where was Mr. Jackson in the room.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, after we all got settled, Mr. Jackson was laying on the bed, and then Gavin was next to him, and then Star. That's what I remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember where Aldo was.
Davellin Arvizo: I think he was sitting on like the corner of the bed. And I was sitting on a chair.
Mr. Sneddon: Go ahead.
Davellin Arvizo: I was sitting on a chair.
Mr. Sneddon: When you walked into that room that time, did you see any alcohol in the room.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes. I saw empty bottles or half full bottles.
Mr. Sneddon: Of what.
Davellin Arvizo: Of alcohol -- I know the shape of bottles, but I don't know what they were, like the names.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did you see it.
Davellin Arvizo: Some were on the nightstand. Some were on the desk, like a stand where the computer was. Some were on that, where the figurines were.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. I've got a couple more photographs I'm going to show you before you get to step down. People's 75, do you recognize that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that an accurate depiction of what the room looked like.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. It's real -- messier.
Mr. Sneddon: So we'll talk about that in just a moment. And People's 76, do you recognize that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that an accurate depiction.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. There's some extra things, but that's pretty much how it was.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Move that 75 and 76 be admitted into evidence, Your Honor.
The Court: They're admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I'd like to have 75 put up on....
Mr. Sneddon: All right. With regard to the exhibit, People's 75, do you recognize that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what is that.
Davellin Arvizo: That's where I kept saying where there was figurines there.
Mr. Sneddon: Lean into the mike.
Davellin Arvizo: That's where I kept saying there was figurines at, like in that area.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, do you see things that are different in that photograph now than when you were there, that you recall.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember seeing that T.V. It wasn't as messy.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, do you see locations in that photograph, People's 75, in which you saw the bottles that you thought were liquor.
Davellin Arvizo: Like there was some right here. There was some, like, where there was enough stability to put them. Like anywhere there was, like, stability to put one, there -- because it looks different. I don't know.
Mr. Sneddon: Go ahead and put the light on where you put it the first time, and let's talk about that.
Davellin Arvizo: Like, they were on the nightstands.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And leave the light on. Okay. On the nightstand on the left-hand side of the bed.
Davellin Arvizo: And there was some on the other side nightstand, too.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there any bottles located on this side of the room that's depicted in People's 75, that you recall.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. There was some -- well, when -- this was not as messy. There was some right here, and then there was one or two right there.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Let's go to the next exhibit. That exhibit is People's 76. Do you see that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, is there anything that's in that photograph that wasn't there when you were there.
Davellin Arvizo: The crib and this was -- I don't remember seeing that.
Mr. Sneddon: So by “this”, do you mean there's a little object that looks like it has a screen that's directly underneath a lamp or between a lamp and the crib.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And that wasn't there, to your recollection.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: And what was the other thing.
Davellin Arvizo: The crib wasn't there.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, indicate to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury -- could you indicate where it was that Mr. Jackson was inside the room when you saw him.
Davellin Arvizo: Right here.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was Gavin.
Davellin Arvizo: Next to him.
Mr. Sneddon: So let's go back to Mr. Jackson. If you'd put the red light up there again. On People's 76, you're indicating on the far left-hand side of the bed.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And next to him was Gavin.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And then where was your brother Star.
Davellin Arvizo: He was on the other end, but I'm trying to remember. I think his son was there too. Like in between Star and Gavin. I'm trying to remember.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Go ahead.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And where on that exhibit, People's No. 76, did you see bottles.
Davellin Arvizo: There was some more on this nightstand, and then if you face the other way.
Mr. Sneddon: Lean into the microphone. Go ahead.
Davellin Arvizo: If you face the other way, like, facing that way, there was a computer to the left of the T.V. screen. It used to be a computer right there. There was some right there.
Mr. Sneddon: And what was the computer on.
Davellin Arvizo: On a stand, I guess. I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Do you remember how long you were there in the room with Mr. Jackson and the boys before you left.
Davellin Arvizo: 30, 45 minutes.
Mr. Sneddon: Couldn't hear you.
Davellin Arvizo: 30, 45 minutes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember what was going on.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, we started watching a movie.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember the movie.
Davellin Arvizo: No. It was just -- I remember it had subtitles. I just remember it had subtitles.
Mr. Sneddon: And how were you watching the movie. Was it on the --
Davellin Arvizo: On that big screen that you pull down.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, when you left Mr. Jackson's room, did the boys leave with you or did you go by yourself.
Davellin Arvizo: I left by myself.
Mr. Sneddon: Did anybody else leave with you at that time.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did you go.
Davellin Arvizo: I went to my room.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, we can take that down now, if you want. And turn the lights on, would be fine, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: You told the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that there was a time that you went to that Calabasas hotel that you identified in those photographs.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, while you were at that particular hotel - okay. - did you go anywhere with Frank Tyson or Vinnie Amen.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did you go.
Davellin Arvizo: They took us to go get passports.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you go with them.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where else.
Davellin Arvizo: That's all I remember right now.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever go shopping.
Davellin Arvizo: Oh, we did go shopping one time.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did you go.
Davellin Arvizo: We went to like an outlet place to go pick up some luggages. And then we went to the mall and picked up some clothes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what was the reason you went shopping.
Davellin Arvizo: They told us we were going to Brazil.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
Davellin Arvizo: Because they told us we were going to Brazil.
Mr. Sneddon: Who told you that.
Davellin Arvizo: Frank. And then earlier on Dieter had already said that.
Mr. Sneddon: Did they say why you were going to Brazil.
Davellin Arvizo: Because they said that -- to get us away because there was death threats on us.
Mr. Sneddon: Who told you that.
Davellin Arvizo: Dieter. And then Frank told me another time, also.
Mr. Sneddon: And you mentioned earlier in your testimony that you had made a trip to The Laugh Factory.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Where is The Laugh Factory; do you know.
Davellin Arvizo: It's in Hollywood.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember -- was it during the time you were at Calabasas or some other time.
Davellin Arvizo: I think it was during that time.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, who went to The Laugh Factory.
Davellin Arvizo: We all -- Vinnie, my mom, my brothers and me went to The Laugh Factory. But my mom and Gavin were the only ones that got off.
Mr. Sneddon: “Got off”. What do you mean, “got off”.
Davellin Arvizo: Got off the car and went to go see Jamie. Because Vinnie told us to stay --
Mr. Sneddon: Just slow down. Let's take it one at a time. Okay. Make sure we got all the characters here. You got into a car. You left from Calabasas, and you went to The Laugh Factory.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Who's in the car.
Davellin Arvizo: Vinnie, me, my mom, and my brothers.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, you get to The Laugh Factory. Who leaves the car.
Davellin Arvizo: My mom and my brother Gavin.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, did Vinnie tell you something at that point in time.
Davellin Arvizo: He told me and Star to stay.
Mr. Sneddon: Did he say why.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: So your mother and Gavin went inside.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you ever go inside during that trip.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes, because Vinnie -- sorry.
Mr. Sneddon: That's all right. We'll take it one step at a time. So you went inside. Now, how long had it been before -- how long were you in the car with your brother and with this Vinnie person that you've identified in the photograph before you went inside.
Davellin Arvizo: About 15 minutes. About 15 minutes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, what happened.
Davellin Arvizo: Um --
Mr. Sneddon: Why was it that you went inside.
Davellin Arvizo: Because Vinnie kept saying, “Where's your mom. Where's your mom. Go get her”. Because he was, I don't know, impatient. He wanted us to leave.
Mr. Sneddon: Did he know, to your knowledge, who your mother was meeting with.
Davellin Arvizo: Just Jamie.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you went -- you told the jury you went inside. Do you want some water.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Did Star go in with you.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Why.
Davellin Arvizo: Vinnie told him to stay.
Mr. Sneddon: So he let you go, but he kept Star.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, you went inside. And when you went inside, who did you see.
Davellin Arvizo: I saw Gavin, my mom and Bill.
Mr. Sneddon: Did -- okay. Anybody else.
Davellin Arvizo: That was it.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, the person you've identified as Bill --
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- had you ever met him before.
Davellin Arvizo: Never.
Mr. Sneddon: This is the first time you met him.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: How long were you inside with your mother and Gavin and this person you've identified as Bill.
Davellin Arvizo: Five minutes, because I just ran and told -- I just ran in and told my mom what Vinnie told me to tell her.
Mr. Sneddon: So after that, did you leave The Laugh Factory.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes. And I went back outside.
Mr. Sneddon: Who came with you.
Davellin Arvizo: My mom and Gavin stood there a little bit longer and then they came out.
Mr. Sneddon: Did -- while you were at the Laugh Factory that day, did you ever see Jamie Masada.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, he was sitting right there.
Mr. Sneddon: Right where.
Davellin Arvizo: With my mom and Gavin and Bill.
Mr. Sneddon: So he was there.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: So how long do you think in total that it was that your mother was indeed with this person Bill and Jamie Masada.
Davellin Arvizo: I think about 30 minutes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, after you came out of The Laugh Factory, where -- did you get back in the car.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And your mother and Gavin came out at some point, I would assume.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: You all got in the car.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And where did you go; do you remember.
Davellin Arvizo: I think we went back in the hotel in Calabasas.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, let's talk about the Calabasas hotel for just a moment. Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember any of the buildings or locations that were around the Calabasas hotel.
Davellin Arvizo: There was a shopping center across the street, I think. It had like a Ralph's in it, I think. I don't really remember. I just saw it when we were driving by.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever go over to the shopping center.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Why.
Davellin Arvizo: We were -- didn't leave the hotel room.
Mr. Sneddon: Why.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't know. Vinnie and Frank said to -- not to leave.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever go down -- does the Calabasas -- does it have a swimming pool.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever go down swimming.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Why.
Davellin Arvizo: Just -- we couldn't leave the room, so -- we didn't even bother to ask, because we know it would be “No”.
Mr. Sneddon: Does the -- to your knowledge, does the lobby of the hotel have like these machines where you can get Cokes and candy or treats or stuff in it.
Davellin Arvizo: They have like -- set out on a counter, like coffee and little muffins and stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you ever go down to get any of that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that when you saw this person sitting in the lobby.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, when we had first got there, Frank -- Vinnie introduced us to him and said that he was supposed to be there to keep us safe and stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever go downstairs to try to get anything.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. We did one time.
Mr. Sneddon: What happened.
Davellin Arvizo: They just said not to leave the room. They seemed kind of irritated about it.
Mr. Sneddon: Who's that.
Davellin Arvizo: Frank.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you say that they took you to get a passport, did you actually physically go with somebody to do that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah. Vinnie's the one that took us.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you know where you went.
Davellin Arvizo: No. All I know was it was an office place. I don't know.
Mr. Sneddon: And were there any other places that you went; do you recall.
Davellin Arvizo: Other than to go get clothes and luggage, no.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. In that big binder that's right there in front of you -- why don't we just clear the area -- Your Honor, if you don't mind, I could just -- Counsel. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, there have been -- I will direct the Court's attention to the book that it has, and in particular to Exhibits 260 and 261 that have been premarked for identification purposes.
The Court: I have them.
Mr. Sneddon: And 262, Your Honor, is a series of passport applications that have been duly certified by the United States Government. And, in fact, they've been signed off by Colin Powell. May those be admitted into evidence.
Mr. Mesereau: No objection, Your Honor.
The Court: They're admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: And then with regard to the second set, Your Honor, they are a set of documents of visas from the Republic of Brazil. And those are also accompanied by the certification of the Brazilian consulate. And I ask that those be admitted into evidence as 262.
Mr. Mesereau: May I just see those for a second.
Mr. Sneddon: Sure. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Mesereau: No objection, Your Honor.
The Court: It's admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, why don't you let me have these.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, with the Court's permission and counsel's permission, I would like to use the originals of these documents to be displayed on the Elmo, rather than copies. Because the copies, you know, the Xeroxing --
Mr. Mesereau: No objection, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: Is it okay -- I would ask some questions to the witness, and perhaps I could give the witness the Xerox copies which I've shown to counsel with the Bates stamp numbers.
Mr. Mesereau: No objection to that.
The Court: I have a question about my numbers on the exhibits. Lorna, is it --
The Clerk: I have a question also, Judge.
The Court: According to our premarked exhibits, 261 and 262 are not --
Mr. Sneddon: No, it's 260 and 261. If I misspoke myself, I apologize.
The Court: Okay. Thank you.
Mr. Sanger: Excuse me. Just for bookkeeping purposes, Your Honor, what has been admitted is 260 and 261 and not 262.
The Court: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: With the Court's permission, I wanted to use the Elmo. I don't know if you need to use a toggle switch or do something --
The Bailiff: Input four.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. We have up on the board Document 260. Yes, 260. All right. Do you recognize that document.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recognize the photograph of the person on that document.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: That's you, huh.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, with regard to the writing that is on that particular document, is that your handwriting.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the signature where it says “Applicant” underneath the photograph, is that your handwriting.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember signing it.
Mr. Sneddon: Does it look like your handwriting.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to -- do you see on the document the -- just a moment. Looking on the document, 260, right over in this area here; do you see that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Does it indicate the destination there, where you're going.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: What's it say.
Davellin Arvizo: Italy and France.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever put that in there.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Have you ever heard you were going to Italy or France.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see this document filled out.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Who filled it out.
Davellin Arvizo: Vinnie did.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you give him the information to put in there.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember. I think he asked my mom for it.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you know why you were making this application.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, they told us we were going to Brazil.
Mr. Sneddon: Were you interested in going to Brazil.
Davellin Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, why don't you direct your attention to 261 for just a second, if you would, the other document. Okay. Do you have that in mind.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: That's your photograph again, correct.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember having that photograph taken.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, now I remember. They took us to Walgreen's to take pictures.
Mr. Sneddon: When you say “they”, who took you to Walgreen's.
Davellin Arvizo: Vinnie did.
Mr. Sneddon: So it was just Vinnie.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was the Walgreen's.
Davellin Arvizo: It was near Calabasas. I don't remember where.
Mr. Sneddon: And who did they take to get the photographs.
Davellin Arvizo: Me, my mom and my brothers.
Mr. Sneddon: All at the same time.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, on this particular information, the -- on this particular document that we're referring to, 261, there's lot of printing on it. Is that your printing.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: You didn't fill that out.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And the information for this, do you know where it came from.
Davellin Arvizo: Um --
Mr. Sneddon: Were you present when it was put on there.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And how did that information get conveyed onto this document. Who wrote it.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, Vinnie wrote it, but he was asking my mom.
Mr. Sneddon: He didn't ask you; he asked your mother.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. All right. I think we can -- Wait just a second, Your Honor. We're going to move the document up just a little farther. Okay. Do you recognize the signature at the bottom by the seal. Right there. And we're talking now about the lower left-hand portion of the document, if you're looking at it from the top.
Davellin Arvizo: I think that's Vinnie's signature. I'm not sure.
Mr. Sneddon: I couldn't hear you.
Davellin Arvizo: I think that's Vinnie's signature. I'm not sure.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. All right. Let's turn the lights on now, Your Honor. Now, you said that during the time that you were at Calabasas, that you recall at least one trip where you went shopping for clothes and a suitcase, something like that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, from -- did you have clothes with you at the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, but -- a couple. Not really anything.
Mr. Sneddon: And where were your belongings.
Davellin Arvizo: They were in my guest room. Where I was staying at.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And then with regard to your other belongings that weren't at the ranch, where were they.
Davellin Arvizo: They were at my -- some of them were at my -- at the Soto apartment. And most of them were more at my grandmother's house.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, why would some of them have been at your grandmother's house.
Davellin Arvizo: Because I had to stay with my grandmother, because she needed me.
Mr. Sneddon: So you were still going to school at --
Davellin Arvizo: Roosevelt.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: Uh-huh.
Mr. Sneddon: Why did your grandmother need you.
Davellin Arvizo: Because she had gotten surgery on her ankle. They had to move something - I forgot what it was - and she couldn't really walk. And my grandfather's a truck driver, so she didn't have anybody but me. Her other granddaughter, she lives too far. And I'm her only other granddaughter.
Mr. Sneddon: Speaking of your grandmother and your grandfather. Your grandfather's a trucker.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Who does he work for.
Davellin Arvizo: He works for Ralph's.
Mr. Sneddon: How long has he done that, to your knowledge.
Davellin Arvizo: Since he was 18 years old.
Mr. Sneddon: And your grandmother.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Does she speak English.
Davellin Arvizo: No. Not at all.
Mr. Sneddon: But your grandfather does.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, he speaks English and Spanish.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when -- do you remember how many days it was that you stayed at the Calabasas Inn.
Davellin Arvizo: Three days. Four days. I don't remember. About that.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry.
Davellin Arvizo: About three days, I think.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember whether you were in the same room the entire time.
Davellin Arvizo: No, we went to another one.
Mr. Sneddon: So do you remember the room numbers at all.
Davellin Arvizo: No. I just remember one was on top of the other.
Mr. Sneddon: So one was on a higher floor. They were not on the same floor.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Let's do it this way: With regard to the first room you went into, was it on the lower floor or the higher floor.
Davellin Arvizo: I think it was on the one on the higher floor.
Mr. Sneddon: And then you went to the one on the lower floor.
Davellin Arvizo: The next floor.
Mr. Sneddon: Were one of the rooms bigger than the others.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: What was the difference.
Davellin Arvizo: One of them had one more bed. Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Did they both have kitchens.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, they both had kitchens.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you know, when you moved floors, whether or not, to your personal knowledge, Vinnie or Frank changed their room.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And how did they change their room. I don't mean how. They didn't go downstairs. But, I mean, were they on the same floor as you folks.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you go back -- after Calabasas. You're finished at Calabasas. Okay. Let me just ask you a few more questions about Calabasas. You're at Calabasas. And I saw in that photograph that you identified that it has a kitchen unit.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did your mom cook while you were there.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: So you didn't use the kitchen unit.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: So how did you get your meals.
Davellin Arvizo: They would either bring it to us -- I think one time we did go out to eat. But most of the time everything was brought to us by the bodyguard guy.
Mr. Sneddon: So you were in your room and they brought the food.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, after Calabasas - after you left the Calabasas Inn, okay. - tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury where you went.
Davellin Arvizo: We went back to Neverland.
Mr. Sneddon: Back to where.
Davellin Arvizo: Neverland.
Mr. Sneddon: And how did you get there.
Davellin Arvizo: They took us. Vinnie did.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the time -- let me go back to just one point. During the time that you were at the Calabasas Inn, you've told us that Vinnie was there. Was Frank Tyson ever there.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, he came at one point.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember how long he was there for.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember. I think a day or two.
Mr. Sneddon: So it was not on a consistent basis.
Davellin Arvizo: No, it was mostly Vinnie that stood there.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. When I asked that, I mean, was he there all of that day, or was he in and out that day. To your knowledge, what you saw.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't know. We were in our room.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Fair enough. So you were taken back to the ranch by Vinnie.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you get back to the ranch, do you remember whether it's dark or whether it's daylight.
Davellin Arvizo: I think it was daylight.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you got to the ranch, where did you go.
Davellin Arvizo: Went to go put our stuff away. And I went to put my stuff in the room, guest room.
Mr. Sneddon: So you were back in the guest room.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And your mother.
Davellin Arvizo: She went back to her same room.
Mr. Sneddon: Now -- and during that period of time, and during that day at some point, did you see Mr. Jackson.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember where your brothers were when they got back to the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember seeing them.
Mr. Sneddon: They weren't with you, in any case.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And you were where. In your room.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: The entire time.
Davellin Arvizo: No, I went out to go, like, eat and stuff, but -- and go drive around and go to the arcade.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see them during that time.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't really remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Do you remember an occasion after you came back from Calabasas -- I'll get away from that. At any time while you were at Neverland Ranch, did you ever go on a trip to Toys R Us.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember, in relationship to your time that you spent at Neverland Valley Ranch, when that was.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: I mean, was it like early on, late on, in the middle; do you remember.
Davellin Arvizo: In the middle. And later on. Like somewhere in there.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember who you went with.
Davellin Arvizo: Mr. Jackson. Aldo. Marie Nicole. Gavin. Star. Me. Frank went. Chris, the bodyguard went also, I think.
Mr. Sneddon: Who.
Davellin Arvizo: Chris, Mr. Jackson's bodyguard also.
Mr. Sneddon: A guy by the name of Chris.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: And we had picked up some fans also.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did you pick up some fans.
Davellin Arvizo: Driving down the road, like before we made a turn. They were on the corner.
Mr. Sneddon: Is this on the ranch premises or off the premises.
Davellin Arvizo: Off.
Mr. Sneddon: And how many of them went with you.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't really remember how many there were. I just -- I just remember that one boy.
Mr. Sneddon: And then you went where. Do you remember what town you went to, to go to Toys R Us.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: How far it was.
Davellin Arvizo: 20 minutes. I don't remember. It wasn't close by, though.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry.
Davellin Arvizo: It wasn't close by, though.
Mr. Sneddon: And how long were you there at the store.
Davellin Arvizo: 45 minutes. 30 minutes.
Mr. Sneddon: What was going on.
Davellin Arvizo: They were just getting toys and we were just shopping.
Mr. Sneddon: Who was.
Davellin Arvizo: Everybody that went.
Mr. Sneddon: So everybody was buying things.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: What did you buy.
Davellin Arvizo: I think I got some roller skates. I think I got roller skates.
Mr. Sneddon: So after this trip to the toy store, where did you go.
Davellin Arvizo: Back to the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with your brother -- his cancer's been in remission, you said.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And to your knowledge, does your brother still have to go back and see the doctor periodically.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes, he does.
Mr. Sneddon: How often.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, now that they --
Mr. Sneddon: Let me --
Davellin Arvizo: Back then.
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah, back then.
Davellin Arvizo: Okay. He would have to go every so many weeks. Because they were monitoring his kidney.
Mr. Sneddon: And was there something that he had to do in connection with that monitoring.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes, he did.
Mr. Sneddon: What was that.
Davellin Arvizo: He would have to pee in a bottle for two days or 24 hours, something like that.
Mr. Sneddon: And have you ever seen this bottle.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes, I have.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you describe it to us.
Davellin Arvizo: It's about this height, of this.
Mr. Sneddon: Of the water container there.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes. And then it has a thick handle, it's plastic. And it's got a real secure, like, top.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, while you were at the ranch, did you receive any information - don't tell me what it was - that caused you to go looking for your brothers about the trip to the hospital.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: From who was it that you got the information.
Davellin Arvizo: My mother.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you do something as a result of that information.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what did you do.
Davellin Arvizo: I went to Mr. Jackson's -- because there's two doors. A door that goes straight into the room and there's a door that goes into a hallway that goes into his room. That door, I was knocking and pounding on.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. When you say “that door”, I'm not exactly clear yet. Talk about that again.
Davellin Arvizo: Because there's a door that goes straight into his room. That's the one that has the code on it.
Mr. Sneddon: Right.
Davellin Arvizo: Then there's a door down -- that's on the hallway, in the front of the hallway. That door was locked.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Davellin Arvizo: So I was pounding on that door.
Mr. Sneddon: You were pounding on that door. So you never got into the hallway.
Davellin Arvizo: No, it was locked.
Mr. Sneddon: And did anybody ever come to the door.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you go back -- where did you go after that.
Davellin Arvizo: I went to my mom and told her that, “They're not letting me in”; that, “They're not answering”.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, after the -- after -- the day after the incident where you were pounding on the door - okay. - did you see your mother leave the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah, her, Gavin and Vinnie were taking Gavin to his doctor's appointment.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you actually see them leave.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know whether it was in the morning or the afternoon or --
Davellin Arvizo: It was in the morning.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you actually see them get into the car.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see whether or not at that point in time Gavin had his bottle full of urine.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And who was actually physically carrying the bottle at that point.
Davellin Arvizo: I think Gavin was carrying it at the beginning, but he passed it to my mom.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you see where they were seated in the car.
Davellin Arvizo: Gavin was sitting in the back and my mom was in the front and Vinnie was driving.
Mr. Sneddon: And was it at this point -- when your mom was in the front of the car, could you tell us whether or not she had the bottle at that point.
Davellin Arvizo: I think she did, because right before they got in the car, that's when Gavin passed the bottle to him -- to my mom.
Mr. Sneddon: So I take it you just saw them drive off.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, later that day, did you see your brother Gavin.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: After he had gone to the hospital.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Was he back on the ranch.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see him drive up or --
Davellin Arvizo: Vinnie drove him up.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see that.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: So where were you when you saw Vinnie and your brother come back.
Davellin Arvizo: I was in front of the main house.
Mr. Sneddon: Was your mother with them.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. When your brother got out of the car, where did he go.
Davellin Arvizo: I think he went to go look for Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry.
Davellin Arvizo: I think he went to go look for Mr. Jackson. I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: But your mother wasn't there.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the time that you were at the ranch, and the boys were at the ranch, and Mr. Jackson was at the ranch --
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: -- talking about that period once you come back from Miami. All right. Just speaking for yourself. Okay. Was there a difference in the relationship between you and your brothers.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: You've described yourself to the jury already as a close family, correct.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Was there anything that changed with regard to that description that you've given the jury about the closeness of the family between you and your brothers.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Overruled.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what it is.
Davellin Arvizo: Me and my brother are very, very close. When -- during this all, it just felt like he didn't want to be near me. He didn't really want to really talk to me. He didn't really want to talk to me. He didn't want to be near me. It just felt weird. And me being his older sister, I just knew something. I don't know. I don't know. Just felt weird.
Mr. Sneddon: Anything else about his behavior that changed, that you noticed.
Davellin Arvizo: He didn't really want to talk to me. He was very distant. He just didn't want to even see my mom. He just thought differently.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, after your brother and Vinnie came back from the hospital trip - okay. - at some point in time after that, did you have a telephone conversation with your mother.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And as a result of the telephone conversation with your mother, did you do something.
Davellin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What did you do.
Davellin Arvizo: I packed all of our stuff and I just threw everything together. My stuff was pretty much already together. Just the boys' clothes were everywhere.
Mr. Sneddon: And what did you do with the boys' clothes.
Davellin Arvizo: Put them back in suitcases.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you talked to your mother on the phone - okay.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: - was anybody present with you.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And at any point in time, were you present when your mother was talking to anybody else at the ranch on the phone before you packed your bags.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you come out after packing your bags, do you know where you're going.
Davellin Arvizo: I'm going to my grandparents' house.
Mr. Sneddon: And did anything -- did anything happen when you came out.
Davellin Arvizo: Came out of the ranch, or --
Mr. Sneddon: No, no, no. You packed your bags, you're going to get a ride, and you're going back to your grandparents' house, right.
Davellin Arvizo: Uh-huh.
Mr. Sneddon: Before you left, did anything happen.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Tell the jury what happened.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, Vinnie came -- or I think it was Frank came up to me and said, “Just leave that suitcase”. And --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Sneddon: It's offered under 223, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. It will be conditionally accepted.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Lean into the microphone.
Davellin Arvizo: Well, Frank had told me, “Just leave that suitcase”. And Gavin said, “Yeah, just leave it”. It was Gavin's things in there.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you leave the suitcase.
Davellin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And to your knowledge, did you ever get that suitcase back.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: You didn't see it come back.
Davellin Arvizo: I don't remember getting it back.
Mr. Sneddon: When you left the ranch, who left.
Davellin Arvizo: Me and my brothers.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know who took you.
Davellin Arvizo: Either Frank or Vinnie. I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did they take you.
Davellin Arvizo: To my grandparents' house.
Mr. Sneddon: When you got to your grandparents' house, who was there.
Davellin Arvizo: My mom and my grandparents. I think Jay was there, too.
Mr. Sneddon: Who.
Davellin Arvizo: I think Jay was there, too.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you ever go back to Neverland Valley Ranch after that.
Davellin Arvizo: No.
The Court: Take our afternoon break now.
Mr. Sneddon: Thank you.
