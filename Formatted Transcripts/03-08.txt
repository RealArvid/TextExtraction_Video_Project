Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION Continued BY MR. SNEDDON:
Mr. Sneddon: Good morning.
Star Arvizo: Good morning.
Mr. Sneddon: I just have a few questions left. Okay. You've indicated to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that an individual by the name of Aldo was present during some of the events that you've described; do you recall that.
Star Arvizo: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there times when you were at the ranch and Aldo was not there.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there times when you were at the ranch when Mr. Jackson and Aldo was not there.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to your sister - okay. - Davellin --
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: -- did Mr. Jackson ever make any statements about Davellin to you.
Star Arvizo: He told us not to tell her anything because he's afraid we might tell our mom.
Mr. Sneddon: About what.
Star Arvizo: About what we're doing.
Mr. Sneddon: What do you mean. What were you doing at the time that Mr. Jackson was making those statements to you.
Star Arvizo: Drinking.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, I want to just show you two last photographs. Mr. Mesereau. Just take a look at those for a second, and I'm going to ask you some questions. The first number on that is People's No. 80 for identification; is that correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to the photograph, People's 80 for identification, do you recognize that.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that an accurate depiction of what it purports to represent.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to People's 81 for identification --
Star Arvizo: 82.
Mr. Sneddon: It's 82.
Star Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. With regard to that, is that an accurate depiction of what it purports to represent.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I move that 80 and 82 be admitted into evidence.
The Court: They're admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, would you put 80 on the top, Star. Do you have 80 on top.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, Your Honor, with the Court's permission, could we activate the overhead. All right. Now, with regard to No. 80, would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what that is.
Star Arvizo: That's the view of the bed from the stairway.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to this particular photograph, People's 80, is there anything different about the photograph than the night that you went up there and saw your brother on the bed with Mr. Jackson with the events that you've described to the jury yesterday, late yesterday.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to the next photograph, People's 82 -- is that People's 82.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. With regard to that view, what is that.
Star Arvizo: That's the view of the bed from the stairway.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to that particular photograph, were the lighting conditions the same or different than depicted in this photograph.
Star Arvizo: Different.
Mr. Sneddon: And how were they different.
Star Arvizo: The lights above the bed were off.
Mr. Sneddon: And what was the light -- the source of the light when you made your observations on the two occasions.
Star Arvizo: The lighting was from the stairs.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you see the -- the comforter, or the cover of the bed there.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you tell us whether or not that was the same comforter or bed covering that was on the bed at the time that you were visiting the ranch back in February and March of 2003.
Star Arvizo: It was.
Mr. Sneddon: And on the night that you said that you saw your brother on the bed on the first occasion with Mr. Jackson, was that comforter on the bed on that occasion.
Star Arvizo: No. It was rolled down.
Mr. Sneddon: Rolled down where.
Star Arvizo: On the floor.
Mr. Sneddon: And so what was the surface of the bed at that point.
Star Arvizo: Another blanket.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall what color that blanket was.
Star Arvizo: No. It was like red. It was different colors.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, with regard to the second time that you saw your brother on the bed with Mr. Jackson that you described to the jury yesterday, where -- where -- what was the condition of that comforter at that time, the blue comforter.
Star Arvizo: Rolled up and on the floor.
Mr. Sneddon: So it was the same both times.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. You can put that down, if you like. Do you remember whether or not on the night that you saw Mr. Jackson -- on the first occasion when you saw Mr. Jackson on the bed with your brother, whether or not the screen, the movie screen, was up or down.
Star Arvizo: It was down.
Mr. Sneddon: So it was in the same condition that it is now.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And how about on the second occasion.
Star Arvizo: It was up.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at any time while you were at the ranch from the time you got back from Miami till the time that you left for the last time, did Mr. Jackson ever make any statements to you about -- other than -- about your sister, about not telling things.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: What did he say. I didn't hear what he said. I'm sorry. I didn't hear the Court's ruling.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: At any time while you were at the ranch during the period of time from Miami till the time that you left, did you have any other conversations with Mr. Jackson that you haven't told us about. Just “Yes” or “No”.
Star Arvizo: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And with regard to those conversations, what topics have you not told us about so far in your testimony that you had a discussion with Mr. Jackson about.
Star Arvizo: There was one time Michael told me -- well, it was me, my brother and Aldo were on the bed, and he was telling us not to tell anything that happened, “Not even if they put a gun to your head”.
Mr. Sneddon: Did he say why.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: No further questions, Your Honor.
The Court: Cross-examine.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please, Your Honor.

Star Arvizo: Two times at the grand jury, and one time yesterday.
Mr. Mesereau: Are they the only times you've testified under oath before.
Star Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know for sure.
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you did testify under oath in a deposition in the J.C. Penney case, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And how old were you when you testified in that case under oath.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember, but I was really young.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you about ten.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you nine.
Star Arvizo: I think I was eight.
Mr. Mesereau: You were eight. Okay. Was that the first time you ever testified under oath.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you testified under oath in support of what your mother was claiming happened to her, right.
Star Arvizo: What happened to us.
Mr. Mesereau: “What happened to us”. You, Gavin and your mother, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Let me ask you some questions about the alarm system at Neverland.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You were interviewed by the police on numerous occasions about what happened at Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know about how many times you've been interviewed by the police about what happened at Neverland.
Star Arvizo: Twice.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you remember giving them descriptions about the alarm system.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You have given the police different descriptions of the alarm system from time to time, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And let me ask you a couple of questions about the alarm. Is there an alarm that goes off when someone enters Michael Jackson's bedroom.
Star Arvizo: Through the hallway or through his bedroom.
Mr. Mesereau: Let's start with the hallway.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Is there an alarm that goes off when you enter Michael Jackson's hallway.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How do you know that there's an alarm that goes off when you enter Michael Jackson's hallway.
Star Arvizo: Because while you're walking through the hallway, you can hear it.
Mr. Mesereau: And have you heard it before.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you hear the alarm that goes off when you enter Michael Jackson's hallway.
Star Arvizo: Every time you walk through it.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think you've heard that alarm go off.
Star Arvizo: A lot of times.
Mr. Mesereau: And it's pretty loud, isn't it.
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, do you know why the alarm is there.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever ask Mr. Jackson, “Why is the alarm there”.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You have set the alarm off yourself, haven't you.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times have you set the alarm off yourself when walking through Michael Jackson's hallway.
Star Arvizo: It's not an alarm. It's just a bell.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, I'm sorry, it's hard to hear the witness here.
Mr. Mesereau: You say it's not an alarm, it's just a bell.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Is it an electric bell.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How do you know it's electric.
Star Arvizo: Because it doesn't sound real.
Mr. Mesereau: It doesn't sound real.
Star Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: It sounds like a loud bell, doesn't it.
Star Arvizo: It sounds electric.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever tried to turn that alarm system off.
Star Arvizo: I don't know how to.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever ask anyone, “How do you turn that alarm system off”.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So, as far as you know, every time you've walked through that hallway, that bell has gone off, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And your understanding is that the purpose of that bell is to let Michael Jackson know if somebody goes through his hallway, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That's the purpose of the alarm, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever have any discussion with any security guard at Neverland about that alarm system.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever ask anyone, “How does it work”.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you got a code from security guards at Neverland, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what code did you get from security guards at Neverland.
Star Arvizo: The master code.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know what security guard gave that to you.
Star Arvizo: No. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: And what is the master code.
Star Arvizo: 1849.
Mr. Mesereau: And what does it do.
Star Arvizo: It gets you into all the doors in Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that every door at Neverland.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that every door in every room.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And would that master code get you into Michael's children's bedroom.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You've been in that bedroom, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You've been in both of them, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You've been in both of his children's bedrooms many times, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you've been in other rooms in the main house, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You've been into what other rooms in the main house.
Star Arvizo: His room, Michael's room. Prince and Paris's room. I think that -- I think those are the doors -- oh, and then the two doors to enter the main house.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you been into any other rooms in the main house.
Star Arvizo: The kitchen room. The living room. The kitchen. Those are the only rooms I've been in.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you get the code that lets you into every room in the house.
Star Arvizo: A little after the Miami trip.
Mr. Mesereau: You had been into every room in the house before you went to Miami, hadn't you.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You had not been into every room in the house before you went to Miami.
Star Arvizo: Not every room.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you go into the main house when Chris Tucker was there and Michael Jackson was absent.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you went upstairs when Chris Tucker was there and Michael Jackson was absent, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, I think we're having trouble hearing, hearing the witness. If he could just talk a little louder.
The Court: Everyone seems to be hearing.
Mr. Sanger: Sometimes you can't.
The Court: The audience is all nodding affirmatively.
The Jury: (In unison) We're not.
The Defendant: Thank you. We can't hear. We can't hear.
Mr. Mesereau: I didn't want to instruct the witness. I didn't think it was my -- it was appropriate. If the Court would, I'd appreciate it, Your Honor.
The Court: You need to speak up. People right there can't hear you.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Because some people didn't hear, I'm going to go over a little bit of this again.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times were you at Neverland before the Miami trip.
Star Arvizo: I don't know exactly.
Mr. Mesereau: Approximately.
Star Arvizo: I don't know exactly.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm just asking if you can estimate.
Star Arvizo: Ten.
Mr. Mesereau: Ten. And of those ten trips, how many do you think Michael was present at. I'm talking about the trips before you went to Miami.
Star Arvizo: I don't know. I know it was more than twice.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When did you first learn there was an alarm system when you entered the hallway to go to Michael Jackson's bedroom.
Star Arvizo: First time we entered his bedroom.
Mr. Mesereau: And approximately when was that, if you know.
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you see Michael Jackson do anything to the alarm system --
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: -- when you first entered his bedroom.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: So it went off, didn't it.
Star Arvizo: What.
Mr. Mesereau: When you first entered Michael Jackson's bedroom, the alarm system in the hallway went off, right.
Star Arvizo: The bell.
Mr. Mesereau: The bell that is an alarm system, right.
Star Arvizo: I didn't think it was an alarm system.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't think the bell that went off when you entered the hallway was an alarm system.
Star Arvizo: Well, because I'm thinking, like, an alarm, like.
Mr. Mesereau: But you knew it was an electric bell, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you knew anytime you entered that hallway it went off, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When you first went into the hallway, you heard that bell, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You never saw Michael Jackson dismantle that system, did you.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, every time you've walked into that hallway to go into Michael Jackson's bedroom, that bell has rung, right.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object, asked and answered.
Mr. Mesereau: I didn't -- excuse me, Your Honor, I don't think I've ever asked that question.
The Court: Overruled.
Star Arvizo: Repeat the question.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure. Every time you --
The Court: I'll have the court reporter repeat it.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm sorry.
The Court Reporter: In fact, every time you've walked into that hallway to go into Michael Jackson's bedroom, that bell has rung, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, during the two times you claim you saw Michael Jackson touch your brother in bed, that bell went off, didn't it.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When you walk into the hallway, Mr. Arvizo, is there another alarm system.
Star Arvizo: Which hallway.
Mr. Mesereau: The hallway going into Mr. Jackson's bedroom. Once you go through the hallway, the bell goes off, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you try to go into Michael Jackson's bedroom upstairs, is there any other alarm.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever had heard of there being another alarm that goes off as you try to enter Michael Jackson's bedroom.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You're aware that if you're in Michael Jackson's bedroom upstairs, you can hear that bell.
Star Arvizo: When the doors are open.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: When the doors are open.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, the purpose of it is to let Michael Jackson know, if he's upstairs, if anybody's come into the hallway, isn't it.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object to that. Calls for speculation on the part of this witness.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Arvizo, did Mr. Jackson ever tell you that the reason that alarm system goes off is to let him know if anyone is trying to enter his bedroom.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: So you were not aware of that.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You have heard that alarm system go off when you were upstairs, haven't you.
Star Arvizo: When the doors open.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. You're saying when the door's closed, Michael Jackson can't hear the alarm system.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that what you're saying.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you discuss yesterday's testimony with anyone last night.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Talk to your mom about it.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Talk to your dad about it.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Talk to your sister about it.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Talk to Gavin about it.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Talk to the D.A. about it.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know what questions Mr. Sneddon was going to ask you when you came in this morning.
Star Arvizo: One or two of them.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How did you know about one or two of them.
Star Arvizo: He called me this morning to clarify something.
Mr. Mesereau: He called you at home.
Star Arvizo: Yeah -- yes.
Mr. Mesereau: So you did discuss yesterday's testimony with someone, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: No, today.
Mr. Mesereau: You did discuss what you said yesterday with Mr. Sneddon before you took the stand this morning, right.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object to that question. Assumes a fact not in evidence, that it was yesterday's materials we discussed.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection, Your Honor. Mr. Sneddon's testifying. Move to strike his comments.
The Court: Sustained. Stricken. Mr. Sneddon, you have been using speaking responses, which I do not allow.
Mr. Sneddon: All right, Your Honor. Then I object. Assumes facts not in evidence.
The Court: I've heard your objection. The objection is overruled. Would the court reporter read back the question to the witness, please.
The Court Reporter: You did discuss what you said yesterday with Mr. Sneddon before you took the stand this morning, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you speak to Mr. Sneddon between your testimony yesterday and your testifying today.
Star Arvizo: Yes. In the morning.
Mr. Mesereau: And about what time was that.
Star Arvizo: 7:00.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. Sneddon talk to you about what he was going to ask you today.
Star Arvizo: He was asking me -- he was trying to clarify if -- about some things.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, he told you that he was going to ask you about Aldo, correct.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: He never told you he was going to ask you anything about Aldo today.
Star Arvizo: Um, he didn't say. He just said -- he asked me if Aldo was there the whole time.
Mr. Mesereau: And did he tell you he was going to ask you a question about that this morning.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he tell you he was going to ask you about any photographs this morning.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever seen the photographs you just identified before.
Star Arvizo: Um, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you see them before.
Star Arvizo: On Sunday.
Mr. Mesereau: On Sunday.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, Mr. Sneddon showed you a bunch of photographs and kept asking you a question, “Is that an accurate depiction”. Remember those questions.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Had he asked you those questions before.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Had he showed you photographs before and said to you, “When you come into court, I'm going to ask you if that's an accurate depiction”; remember.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember those questions he asked you.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember, Mr. Sneddon showed you photographs in the courtroom and said, “Is this an accurate depiction of what's in the photograph”.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Had he told you before you testified yesterday that he was going to ask you that question.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that the first time you ever heard him ask you that question.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You went through photograph after photograph, and when he said to you, “Is that an accurate depiction”. You always said “Yes”, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that the first time he'd ever asked you that question in the courtroom.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you made a lot of statements that this was an accurate depiction, and then afterwards told the jury that there were things in the photographs that you didn't think were accurate, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was because you have a detailed memory of what went on when you used to go to Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You had never gone over that with Mr. Sneddon or any other member of the prosecution before, right.
Star Arvizo: About what.
Mr. Mesereau: About those photos.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Before you testified yesterday, had you ever discussed what you were going to say with your mom.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Before you testified yesterday, had you ever discussed with Gavin what you were going to say.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Before you testified yesterday, had you ever discussed with your sister Davellin what you were going to say.

Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever discussed this case with Gavin.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever discussed this case with Davellin.

Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me.
Star Arvizo: Tom, Gordon and Ron.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm sorry, we're having trouble hearing the name.
Star Arvizo: Tom, Gordon and Ron.
Mr. Mesereau: Tom, Gordon and Ron. Have you ever discussed this case with Larry Feldman.
Star Arvizo: No, I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know who Larry Feldman is.
Star Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Who do you think he is.
Star Arvizo: I don't know what he does.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You never heard the name “Larry Feldman” before.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever heard the name “William Dickerman” before.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And have you met with Attorney William Dickerman before.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think you've met with Attorney William Dickerman.
Star Arvizo: Once.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was before you ever spoke to anyone with the sheriff's department, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, do you know whether or not William Dickerman sent your entire family to Attorney Larry Feldman.
Star Arvizo: No. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: And you don't recall ever meeting with Attorney Larry Feldman.
Star Arvizo: I do recall meeting with him, but I don't know who sent us to him.
Mr. Mesereau: And how many times have you met with Attorney Larry Feldman.
Star Arvizo: Probably twice.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know approximately when that was.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it in the last year.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Last two years.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was your mom at that meeting.
Star Arvizo: We never had a meeting. Well, I don't -- I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you've given different descriptions at different times of what you say happened in Michael Jackson's bedroom, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't understand.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you've been asked to describe many times what happened in Michael Jackson's bedroom at Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You've been asked by the sheriffs a couple of times, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you've been interviewed by the Santa Barbara Sheriffs about what you claim happened in Michael Jackson's bedroom, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And they've asked you to describe what went on in Michael Jackson's bedroom, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you've also been before a grand jury to testify about what went on in Michael Jackson's bedroom, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You've also met with a psychologist named Stanley Katz, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And Stanley Katz works for Larry Feldman, right.
Star Arvizo: I didn't know that.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you knew that Larry Feldman sent you to Stanley Katz, right.
Star Arvizo: I didn't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Never heard anything about that.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Your mother never told you that.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, when you met with Psychologist Stanley Katz, you also describe what you claim happened in Michael Jackson's bedroom, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And would you agree that you've given different descriptions almost every time that you have described it.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember exactly what I said.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you've given different descriptions about what Michael Jackson was wearing, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember exactly what I said.
Mr. Mesereau: You've given different descriptions of what Gavin was supposed to be wearing, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember exactly what I said.
Mr. Mesereau: You've given different descriptions about what you claim Michael Jackson did in the bedroom, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, there were times you said that Michael Jackson put his hand on top of your brother's underwear, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember saying that.
Mr. Mesereau: And there are other times you said he put his hand inside his underwear, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And there are times you've said your brother was wearing pajamas, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: There are times you said he was wearing underwear, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: And there are times you said that Michael Jackson touched his butt and not his crotch, right.
Star Arvizo: When was this.
Mr. Mesereau: When you did some interviews, right.
Star Arvizo: About what.
Mr. Mesereau: About what Michael Jackson, you claim, was doing in his bedroom, right.
Star Arvizo: I never said he touched his butt.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever tell anyone that when you saw Michael Jackson in bed with your brother, he was rubbing his butt.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never said that at any time to anybody.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never said it to Mr. Katz, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never said it to the sheriffs, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And never said it to a grand jury, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You indicated yesterday that Michael Jackson was trying to teach you and your brother cuss words, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And was that the truth.
Star Arvizo: He wasn't trying to teach us. He was just telling us to cuss.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever use cuss words before you met Michael Jackson.
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever know what those cuss words even meant.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When you were -- let me strike that. Let me rephrase. You had your deposition taken in the J.C. Penney case on December 15th, the year 2000, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember the dates.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your memory if I just show you the deposition date.
Star Arvizo: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Arvizo, have you had a chance to look at that page.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And it says, “December 15th, 2000”, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Where were you living during December 15th, 2000.
Star Arvizo: I was living at the Soto address.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, in that deposition, you said you were living on Raymer Street; do you remember.
Star Arvizo: Yes. No, I don't remember the deposition.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you that part of your deposition.
Star Arvizo: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page of your deposition of the J.C. Penney case.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And does it refresh your recollection that you said you were living on Raymer Street at that point.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, where is Raymer Street.
Star Arvizo: It's in El Monte.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Is that where your grandparents live.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And when you answered these questions in the J.C. Penney case under oath, you were ten years old, right.
Star Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. In that deposition, you were asked whether you had discussed the facts of the J.C. Penney case with anyone before you were deposed, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember that. And you said you had not discussed the facts --
Star Arvizo: Actually, I don't remember that question.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you that page.
Star Arvizo: It's okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Huh.
Star Arvizo: It's okay.
Mr. Mesereau: What do you mean, it's --
Star Arvizo: Oh, okay.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Star Arvizo: Where's the question.
Mr. Mesereau: Right here.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page in your deposition in the J.C. Penney case.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection that you said you had not discussed the facts of that case with your mother or anybody else.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And was that true.
Star Arvizo: What.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it true that before you answered questions under oath in the J.C. Penney case that you had never discussed the facts of that case with anyone.
Star Arvizo: After the --
Mr. Mesereau: Between the time the events happened, or that you claim happened in the parking lot at J.C. Penney, and the time you answered questions under oath, you had not discussed the facts with anybody, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You hadn't discussed the facts with your mother, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Hadn't discussed them with Gavin, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Hadn't discussed them with Davellin, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you hadn't discussed them with your father David, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you indicated to the jury that you've done some training as a comedian; is that right.
Star Arvizo: It wasn't really actual training. We just did it for fun.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: It wasn't actually training. We just did it for fun.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But did you take a class.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you take an acting class.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever modeled.
Star Arvizo: That was for our -- our dance group that we used to be in.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did you model.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you claim you have modeled at J.C. Penney's, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember the store.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you your deposition in the J.C. Penney case.
Star Arvizo: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection that you claim you were modeling at J.C. Penney.
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you modeling at J.C. Penney.
Star Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: You think so.
Star Arvizo: Yeah. Since it says it on the -- there.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, please tell the jury what the truth is. Were you really modeling at J.C. Penney.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object to that question as argumentative.
The Court: Sustained. The jury is admonished to disregard Mr. Mesereau's remark.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you modeling at J.C. Penney on that day.
Star Arvizo: What day.
Mr. Mesereau: The day the events happened in the parking lot.
Star Arvizo: No. That was -- that was way before then.
Mr. Mesereau: But you testified under oath that you were there to model, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: No. I was there -- I was there to model about -- years ago. We were just waiting for our mom to come out of her job interview.
Mr. Mesereau: Correct me if I'm wrong, when you were testifying under oath in a deposition, you said under oath that you were there to model that day, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: Not that day. We were there before to model. Not at that J.C. Penney's.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you model before.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When was that.
Star Arvizo: It was a long time ago when we were little. It was a long time ago when we were little.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you testified under oath that your brother Gavin took some clothes that weren't paid for into the parking lot, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't remember saying that.
Star Arvizo: No. It was long ago.
Mr. Mesereau: Has anyone told you to give a response like that to my questions.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Has anyone told you to say “I don't remember” when you respond to my questions.
Star Arvizo: If I don't remember, I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Do you remember testifying that your brother went into the parking lot with clothes that weren't paid for to trick your father into buying them.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you your testimony.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said under oath in the deposition.
Star Arvizo: A little bit.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you said your brother wanted to trick your dad into buying clothes, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said that that's why he went into the mall with the unpaid clothes, right.
Star Arvizo: He went into the mall.
Mr. Mesereau: Into the parking lot in the mall.
Star Arvizo: Oh.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me restate it. You testified under oath that your brother left J.C. Penney's with clothes that weren't paid for because he was trying to trick your dad into buying them, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes, but the paragraph wasn't over.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. What else did you say about that.
Star Arvizo: Um -- could I reread it.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure. May I return, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Star Arvizo: Thank you. Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at the page again.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And does it refresh your recollection about what you testified to that day.
Star Arvizo: A little bit.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How has it refreshed your recollection.
Star Arvizo: It said right there that -- that my dad took them and put them back.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you said that Gavin wouldn't steal because he wants to be a priest, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember saying that.
Mr. Mesereau: You said he wants to be a priest and a comedian, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember saying that.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, did anyone ask you to say that, if you recall.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Before you went into that deposition to testify under oath, did anyone tell you if you're asked if Gavin stole, say, “No, he wants to be a comedian and a priest”.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember nothing in that case.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you another page.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said.
Star Arvizo: A little bit, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And didn't you say that Gavin wants to be a priest and a comedian when he grows up.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said that he wouldn't steal, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But no one told you to say that before the deposition, right.
Star Arvizo: Hmm, what was it. Say it again.
Mr. Mesereau: Yeah. Nobody told you to make that statement before you went into that deposition and testified, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you testified under oath that security guards from J.C. Penney approached your mother in the parking lot and said, “We're going to fuck you up”, and called your dad “a fucking asshole”, right.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object to the question as a violation of the Court's ruling.
The Court: Sustained.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember the exact words.
The Court: Just a minute. You don't have to answer that question.
Mr. Mesereau: But you're telling the jury that before you met Michael Jackson, you had never used the “F” word, right.
Star Arvizo: I spelled it out for them.
Mr. Mesereau: Spelled it out for you.
Star Arvizo: The people that were interviewing us or -- I didn't say it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And in your personal life as a young boy, you had never used that word once, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: The first time you heard it was in the J.C. Penney parking lot, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you testified that your mother had been beaten up in the parking lot, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said that her private parts had been touched.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. Same objection.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: When you went to Stanley Katz, you knew he was a psychologist, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know he was a therapist.
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you been to a therapist ever before.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When was that.
Star Arvizo: During the J.C. Penney case.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you go with your mom.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, your whole family went to a therapist in that case, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Don't remember at all.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: May we approach, Your Honor.
The Court: No.
Mr. Mesereau: In the J.C. Penney case, you testified to what these guards were doing to your mother, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. Same objection.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was the first time you ever testified, right.
Star Arvizo: When.
Mr. Mesereau: In the J.C. Penney deposition.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And nobody told you what to say before it, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Never discussed it with your mom before you went into the deposition, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Just like you've never discussed the facts of this case with your mom at any time, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When was the first time that you ever discussed what you claim Mr. Jackson had done to you.
Star Arvizo: What.
Mr. Mesereau: When is the first time you ever discussed with anybody what you say Mr. Jackson did to you.
Star Arvizo: I think it was with Dr. Katz.
The Court: Excuse me. If you can't hear him, I'd like to have hand signs. There's no way I can know. And that way I can just have him speak up. The people in the audience are hearing him fine. But when he drops off, I can't tell whether you're hearing him or not. Sorry, Counsel. Go ahead.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: When is the first time you ever discussed what you claim Mr. Jackson did to you.
Star Arvizo: I think it was with Dr. Katz.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that before you ever discussed any of this with any police officer.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you discussed what you claim Mr. Jackson did to you with Attorney Larry Feldman, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember one way or the other.
Star Arvizo: I didn't understand that question.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure. Are you saying you don't remember ever discussing this case with Attorney Larry Feldman.
Star Arvizo: No, I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you do remember meeting with Larry Feldman, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And your mom was there, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Gavin was there, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember saying in the J.C. Penney deposition that your mom and dad never fight.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. Same objection.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember saying that.
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you a page from that deposition.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Oops.
Star Arvizo: That's okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page from the deposition.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said.
Star Arvizo: A little bit.
Mr. Mesereau: And didn't you say under oath that your mother and dad never fight.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that true.
Star Arvizo: Hmm, I really don't -- sometimes.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm sorry, I didn't understand your answer. When you told -- excuse me. Let me rephrase. When you stated under oath in the J.C. Penney deposition in the year 2000 that your mom and dad never fight, were you telling the truth.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did someone tell you to lie in that deposition.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't remember at all.
Star Arvizo: No. It happened a long time ago.
Mr. Mesereau: You also said in that deposition under oath that your dad never hit you; do you remember that.
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you that page.
Star Arvizo: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page of your deposition.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And does it refresh your recollection about what you said that day.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You were asked if your dad had ever hit you, and you said, “Never”, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that the truth.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did someone ever tell you to lie about that under oath in your deposition in the J.C. Penney case.
Star Arvizo: I really don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Don't remember at all.
Star Arvizo: No. I don't remember nothing from there.
The Bailiff: Judge, they can't hear him. They can't hear him.
The Court: You can't hear in the back. The witness, is it. You need to lean into the microphone like that.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have your -- excuse me. Has -- did your father ever coach you about what to say in the J.C. Penney deposition.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did your mother ever coach you about what to say in the J.C. Penney deposition.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Please tell the jury why you lied under oath.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember. It was, like, five years ago. I don't remember nothing.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you discussed the J.C. Penney deposition with any of the prosecutors.
Star Arvizo: No.

Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever discussed the J.C. Penney deposition with any attorney.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You had an attorney representing you at the J.C. Penney deposition, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Who was that.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever discussed this case with your grandmother.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever discussed it with your grandfather.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever discussed the J.C. Penney lawsuit with your grandmother.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And have you ever discussed the J.C. Penney lawsuit with your grandfather.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was Michael Jackson the first person you ever heard use a cuss word.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Who was, if you remember.
Star Arvizo: It was a kid at school.
Mr. Mesereau: That's the first time you ever heard those words.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: But you've never used them yourself, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes, I've used them.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you use them now.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never use them.
Star Arvizo: What do you mean.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, in your personal life right now, do you ever use the “F” word.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you ever use the “B” word.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You indicated yesterday that you visited Neverland with Chris Tucker when Michael Jackson wasn't there, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, how did you end up going there with Chris Tucker.
Star Arvizo: I don't know. I think it was my brother that set it up. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know kind of how you ended up going there with Chris.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Who drove you to Neverland during those trips that you went with Chris Tucker.
Star Arvizo: During all the trips.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: A bus driver.
Mr. Mesereau: You went by bus to Neverland with Chris Tucker.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was it a private bus.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know how that was arranged.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Who went on those bus rides.
Star Arvizo: Me and my brother, my sister, Chris, Chris's apprentice. I don't know. There was other people, too.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did you know that Michael Jackson was not going to be there when you arrived.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember all the times.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, when you went with Chris Tucker, did you think Michael Jackson was going to be there.
Star Arvizo: Probably.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me.
Star Arvizo: Probably.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know if Chris told you he would be there.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Why did you think Michael would be there.
Star Arvizo: I don't know. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: By the way, do you remember yesterday when you told the jury that on the plane you looked at a soda can that Michael Jackson had and you saw a red ring around it.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told that to the police in one of your interviews also, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: You also told the police that you looked in the can and saw white wine, correct.
Star Arvizo: When.
Mr. Mesereau: When you told them there was a red ring around the can, you then told them you looked in the can and saw white wine, remember.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember saying that.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you a transcript from a police interview.
Star Arvizo: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Excuse me, what page.
Star Arvizo: The lady might have misheard me.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me, what did you just say.
Star Arvizo: I never looked into the can.
Mr. Mesereau: You said a lady might have misheard you.
Star Arvizo: The -- I don't know what her -- what the --
Mr. Mesereau: The court reporter.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, you think the court reporter made a mistake.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Because, as you've seen, it says you told the police there was a red ring around the can and then you looked in and saw white wine, right. That's what it says, doesn't it.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: But what you're telling the jury is you think the court reporter made a mistake.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you have a lot of experience with court reporters.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell Michael Jackson you wanted to be an actor.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever tell Michael Jackson you wanted to make videos.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever make any videos with Michael Jackson.

Mr. Mesereau: When did you do that.
Star Arvizo: A long time ago.

Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it when you first met Michael Jackson.
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever make a video at Neverland yourself.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And please tell the jury when that was.
Star Arvizo: I don't know when it was.
Mr. Mesereau: And describe what you did when you made that video.
Star Arvizo: I think we were -- I don't remember exactly. We were just talking about the animals and talking about the ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: And who is “we”.
Star Arvizo: Me and whoever happened to be there. Like the zoo lady or train driver.
Mr. Mesereau: And was that in the fall of 2002.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember the approximate year when you first went to Neverland.
Star Arvizo: 2000.
Mr. Mesereau: And how do you know it was 2000.
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Did somebody tell you it was the year 2000.
Star Arvizo: No, I just remember my brother had cancer in the year 2000.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, how long after your brother contracted cancer did you and he visit Neverland, if you know.
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it a number of months.
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know if your brother was undergoing medical treatment when he first went to Neverland.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And if you remember, had the treatment just begun.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: What was your understanding about how your brother first communicated with Michael Jackson.
Star Arvizo: By telephone.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you hear about that right away, if you know.
Star Arvizo: What.
Mr. Mesereau: Did your brother tell you right away, “I just spoke to Michael Jackson on the telephone”.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he call you up and tell you that.
Star Arvizo: I was standing -- I was laying right next to him.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. This was in the hospital.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And suddenly the phone rang and it was Michael Jackson.
Star Arvizo: I didn't know it was Michael Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How did you find out it was him.
Star Arvizo: After my brother hung up.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, in your police interviews, you keep referring to David as “My biological father”, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You also refer to him as “My biological dad”, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Who told you to use the word “biological”.
Star Arvizo: I learned it in one of my English classes.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, other members in your family have been referring to him as their biological dad, right.
Star Arvizo: Yeah, and also my sister uses it.
Mr. Mesereau: Did your mom ever tell you to refer to David as your biological dad.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: She never did once.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever hear your mother telling your sister to refer to David as your biological dad.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever hear your mom tell Davellin to refer to her father as her biological dad.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. That was something you came up with, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes. This was after we met Jay, so we didn't think of my dad as a dad anymore. So that's why we called him a biological dad, because we were calling Jay “Dad”.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you've been into Prince and Paris's bedroom, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And just please tell the jury who Prince and Paris are.
Star Arvizo: They're Michael's children.
Mr. Mesereau: When you first went to Neverland, did you meet Michael's children.
Star Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember who introduced you to Michael's children.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see them on the first visit to Neverland.
Star Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And where did you first meet Prince and Paris.
Star Arvizo: At Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know what ages they were when you first met them.
Star Arvizo: I think they were three and four.
Mr. Mesereau: And could you describe them to the jury.
Star Arvizo: They're small. Small. One has blonde hair. The other one has long brown curly hair. What else. That's all.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the jury that Prince and Paris were in Miami when you made a trip to Miami, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the jury that Prince and Paris were in Michael's suite, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you first went into Michael's suite, Prince and Paris were there, right.
Star Arvizo: What part of the suite.
Mr. Mesereau: Any part.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And when you went back on the plane from Miami to Santa Barbara, Prince and Paris were on the plane, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And two nannies were with them, right.
Star Arvizo: One nanny was with two kids, and the other nanny was with the baby.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And tell the jury who the baby was.
Star Arvizo: Michael's son.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Would you please describe the baby to the jury.
Star Arvizo: Small.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And who was the nanny with Michael's baby.
Star Arvizo: Her name was Patty.
Mr. Mesereau: And who was the nanny with Prince and Paris.
Star Arvizo: Grace.
Mr. Mesereau: And they're all on the plane with you when you go back from Miami, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And a physician was on the plane as well, right.
Star Arvizo: I didn't know what his profession was.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you know he was a doctor.
Star Arvizo: From his name, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You heard people call him “Doctor”, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And was it your understanding his name was Farshshian.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So Dr. Farshshian's on the plane as well, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever ask anyone whose doctor he was.
Star Arvizo: All I knew is that he was Michael's doctor.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Now, yesterday you told Prosecutor Sneddon where everybody was sitting, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And --
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: -- you looked at this diagram, and you said, “That's a diagram of the inside of that plane”, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you know that was a diagram about the inside of that plane.
Star Arvizo: Because that's how it looked inside.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever go over that diagram with any prosecutor before you testified.
Star Arvizo: I think so, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You think so.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you sure.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You did do it, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what prosecutor did you go over that diagram with before you testified.
Star Arvizo: Um, let me remember. It was Tom.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that Tom Sneddon.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did you do that with him.
Star Arvizo: On Sunday.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he visit you on Sunday.
Star Arvizo: No, I visited him.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. At his office.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did someone bring you to his office.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know who that was.
Star Arvizo: It was Steve Robel.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. That's a Santa Barbara sheriff, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And had you seen that diagram before Sunday.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. Sneddon tell you, “This is a diagram of the inside of the plane”.
Star Arvizo: No. I knew it was a diagram. I was the one that drew it up for Tom.
Mr. Mesereau: So you drew the whole diagram up for Prosecutor Sneddon.
Star Arvizo: No, I just drew a picture and I gave it to Tom.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know where that picture is.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did -- you just gave it to Sneddon.
Star Arvizo: Yes. Well, it was in the beginning of this case.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm sorry. Pardon.
Star Arvizo: It was in the beginning of the case.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So the beginning of this case, you did a diagram of the interior of that plane.
Star Arvizo: I just did a drawing.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. A drawing of the plane that you flew on from Miami, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you say, “At the beginning of this case”, what do you mean.
Star Arvizo: It was before the grand jury.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know whatever happened to the drawing.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you remember where all the seats were --
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: -- inside that plane.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that's what you drew in the drawing, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did Mr. Sneddon tell you that the diagram you had was based upon your drawing.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. He just came up with this and showed it to you on Sunday, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did he ask you to put little initials where everybody was sitting.
Star Arvizo: No. We did that yesterday.
Mr. Mesereau: That was the first time you'd ever done that.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: First time you'd ever looked at that drawing and put initials where everybody was sitting.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When you were with Mr. Sneddon on Sunday, did you point out to him where people were sitting.
Star Arvizo: He told me not to.
Mr. Mesereau: He told you not to tell him where people were sitting.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, let me ask you this: If he showed you this diagram of the plane, do you know why he would tell you, “Don't tell me where people are sitting”.
Star Arvizo: I was actually -- well, I wanted to see it.
Mr. Mesereau: You wanted to see what.
Star Arvizo: I wanted to see the diagram.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ask him in advance that you wanted to see the diagram.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You're sitting with Mr. Sneddon in a Sunday meeting, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what time was that.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember. It was afternoon.
Mr. Mesereau: Afternoon. Okay. Do you know about how long the meeting went.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you there alone with Prosecutor Sneddon.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Who else was there.
Star Arvizo: Steve Robel.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was Sheriff Robel talking.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Who first gave you the diagram.
Star Arvizo: Steve walked in with it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So he walks in with it and hands it to you, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And he asks you about the diagram, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you're saying that Prosecutor Sneddon said, “Don't tell us where people were sitting”.
Star Arvizo: No, I was about to, but then he said, “No, don't tell me”. So I didn't say nothing. I just wanted to go over it by myself.
Mr. Mesereau: You wanted to go over the diagram just by yourself.
Star Arvizo: Oh, in my head.
Mr. Mesereau: In your head.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So correct me if I'm wrong, you looked at this diagram; everybody was silent, and you thought about it in your head, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And then you gave it back to Prosecutor Sneddon, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Never discussed anything about what's on the diagram, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Never discussed it at all, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, in one of your police interviews, you were asked if you knew the difference between right and wrong, remember.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said you learned the difference between right and wrong from your mom, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was the truth, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Your mom told you never to lie, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did she tell you that before the J.C. Penney deposition.
Star Arvizo: She told us that our whole life.
Mr. Mesereau: Whole life.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You actually told the police that you think lying is a sin, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes, I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember if you did that.
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Would it refresh your recollection if I show you the transcript.
Star Arvizo: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Actually, he testified that, yes, he told the police that.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, I thought -- I didn't --
The Court: Then you went on to his memory. So, denied.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: Move along.
Mr. Mesereau: All right.
Mr. Mesereau: You know you're not supposed to lie under oath, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Has anyone discussed that with you before.
Star Arvizo: My whole family.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Star Arvizo: The D.A.
Mr. Mesereau: They have all told you, “Don't ever lie under oath”, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes. They just told me to tell the truth.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you talked about driving golf carts at Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you and your brothers used to do that during your visits to Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
The Court: Let's take our break, Counsel.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, Your Honor.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately when your family --
The Bailiff: You have to turn your mike on.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, okay. Sorry. I'll start again.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately when your family left Neverland and never came back.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: It was in the spring of 2003, wasn't it.
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, it was -- let me try and see if we can get to that place. You went to Miami in February of 2003, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember. I just know when we finally left, we had enough time to go back to school.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And when did school start.
Star Arvizo: September.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Star Arvizo: September.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you think you were at Neverland in June 2003.
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you think you were there in April of 2003.
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Have you ever discussed with your mom when you left Neverland and never came back.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you think you were at Neverland in August of 2003.
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you there right before you started school.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You actually left many months before you started school, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: No. We were in school.
Mr. Mesereau: You were in school when you left Neverland, never to come back.
Star Arvizo: No. No. I didn't understand your question.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Let me try and not confuse you. You come back from Miami, right.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: And you go to Neverland, right. And at some point you left Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you're back from Miami, you stay at Neverland, and then you leave. Where do you go when you leave.
Star Arvizo: Back to Jay's house.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. That's Jay Jackson, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And is that when you had the interviews at Jay Jackson's house.
Star Arvizo: When we left the last time.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: We never had an interview.
Mr. Mesereau: Never had an interview at Jay Jackson's house.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever have an interview with three social workers at Jay Jackson's house.
Star Arvizo: Yes, but that was during this whole thing at Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I'm just trying to find out approximately when -- excuse me. Yesterday you told the jury that at one point you left Neverland for the last time, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you never came back again, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was before you went to see Attorney Larry Feldman, wasn't it.
Star Arvizo: Before we left Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: No. You left Neverland for the last time before you first met Attorney Larry Feldman, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't understand the question.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. At some point you met Attorney Larry Feldman, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you went to see Attorney Larry Feldman with your mom, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was after you had left Neverland for the last time, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point, Larry Feldman sent you to a psychologist named Katz, right.
Star Arvizo: I didn't know -- I didn't know he sent us.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, you went to see a psychologist named Stanley Katz, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you saw him after you first met Attorney Larry Feldman, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you met Attorney Larry Feldman after you met Attorney William Dickerman, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And this all happened in the spring of 2003, didn't it.
Star Arvizo: I don't -- I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know. You were never at Neverland in the summer of 2003, were you.
Star Arvizo: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you discussed many times with the Santa Barbara Sheriffs the fact that you left Neverland in the spring of 2003 and never came back, right.
Star Arvizo: Wait.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure.
Star Arvizo: I was there in 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: No, no. You were there in 2003, but you left in the spring, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember when I left.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Have you ever discussed with the sheriffs when you left.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know if you were there in July of 2003.
Star Arvizo: Don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You could have been.
Star Arvizo: Probably.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: Probably.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the jury the first night you spent at Neverland, you slept where.
Star Arvizo: First out of all the trips.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: In the guest unit.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was your first night, right.
Star Arvizo: Of the first time I ever went to Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, the first time you went to Neverland, do you recall having dinner with Michael Jackson in the main dining room.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And who was there for that dinner.
Star Arvizo: My mom -- wait. I know it was my dad, my brother, me, my sister, Michael. I think my mom was there also.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Let me ask you this: You don't recall seeing Psychologist Sanely Katz in May of 2003, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't -- I don't know the dates.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you his testimony. Would that help you.
Star Arvizo: His.
Mr. Mesereau: If I showed you what Psychologist Stanley Katz told the grand jury.
Star Arvizo: Sure. But I don't know the dates.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. If I showed you what he said, would that remind you.
Star Arvizo: I never knew the dates.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. So even if you saw it, it wouldn't --
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: -- wouldn't jog your memory. Okay. Okay. And if I told you you saw Stanley Katz again in June of 2003, that wouldn't jog your memory, would it.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And if I told you when you first saw Attorney Larry Feldman, that wouldn't jog your memory, would it.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you never went back after you met Psychologist Katz, right.
Mr. Sneddon: Excuse me, Your Honor. Vague.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know if you ever returned to Neverland after you first met Psychologist Stanley Katz.
Star Arvizo: We never returned after we met Stanley Katz.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And would it be true -- excuse me. It is true that you never returned to Neverland after you met Attorney Larry Feldman, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you first spoke to the Santa Barbara Sheriffs after you met Stanley Katz, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you first went to the Santa Barbara Sheriffs after you met Attorney Larry Feldman, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Is there anything I could show you that would remind you --
Star Arvizo: I never knew the dates.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay -- - of when you met Attorney Feldman. Don't know.
Star Arvizo: Never knew.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Okay. Do you have any idea what month it was when you last went to Neverland.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. But you never were there in August of 2003, were you.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember the dates.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know, okay. Now, you told the Santa Barbara Sheriffs about the locks in Michael Jackson's home, did you not.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said his bedroom has double doors, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes. When you first enter the room.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said there are several locks, right.
Star Arvizo: There's seven locks.
Mr. Mesereau: Seven locks.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Including a combination lock, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you know there were seven locks.
Star Arvizo: I don't know. I just remember looking at them.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know the combination to that combination lock.
Star Arvizo: Do you mean the digit key pad.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you told the police there's a combination lock, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: I said there was a key pad.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was that the code you were talking about.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And did that code unlock the seven locks.
Star Arvizo: No, it only unlocked one lock. The other six locks were unlocked manually.
Mr. Mesereau: Were what.
Star Arvizo: Were unlocked by hand.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Have you ever unlocked any of those several locks.
Star Arvizo: I really don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't remember at all.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You were caught trying to unlock those locks one time, weren't you.
Star Arvizo: When.
Mr. Mesereau: At Neverland.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember that.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall anyone from security ever catching you trying to open those locks.
Star Arvizo: From the outside.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: You -- it's impossible to open them from the outside.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever try to do it.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you ever caught by any security person trying to open those locks.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Don't recall that at all.
Star Arvizo: If -- if I ever went to the door and punched in the -- the key code, if it didn't open, I just left. I never tried to force it open.
Mr. Mesereau: So, you're telling the jury that you did go, on at least one occasion --
Star Arvizo: No, I'm saying if that ever happened.
Mr. Mesereau: If it ever happened.
Star Arvizo: If those two doors were locked.
Mr. Mesereau: Right. If they were locked and you didn't know the code, you couldn't get in, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And are you saying you tried a code one time that didn't work.
Star Arvizo: No, I'm just saying.
Mr. Mesereau: Just saying what.
Star Arvizo: If the door was locked and you punch in the key code, there's no other way you could possibly get in.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Because you tried it and it didn't work one time, right.
Star Arvizo: I never said I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you.
Star Arvizo: I'm just saying if I tried, that would happen.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever try that.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never once.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And never were caught by anyone trying to use the wrong code.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know if your brother was ever caught trying to use the wrong code to get in.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you told the sheriffs that the code was either 1960 or 1849, right.
Star Arvizo: It was 1960 and 1849.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you know that.
Star Arvizo: Because 1849 was the master code. And 1960, 1960 got you into Michael's room.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the sheriffs that 1849 is a general combination for Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes. It's the master code.
Mr. Mesereau: And 1960 is a combination for Michael's bedroom, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes. It's the code for Michael's bedroom.
Mr. Mesereau: Which one are you telling the jury the security guard gave you.
Star Arvizo: 1849.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know why the security guard gave it to you and not Michael.
Star Arvizo: We never really asked Michael for that. He just showed us one day.
Mr. Mesereau: The security guard did.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you remember the codes to this day, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think you've used those codes.
Star Arvizo: A lot of times.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times; do you think.
Star Arvizo: Probably over a hundred.
Mr. Mesereau: Over a hundred times you've been to Michael Jackson's bedroom.
Star Arvizo: No, it gets you in everywhere.
Mr. Mesereau: So you've probably used these codes to see every room in Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: No, I just -- I just knew the codes.
Mr. Mesereau: Huh.
Star Arvizo: I memorized them.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Star Arvizo: So I won't get locked out.
Mr. Mesereau: But you've used them about a hundred times you said, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You've been into every single room at Neverland, haven't you.
Star Arvizo: At one point, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You went in with your brothers, right. Or, excuse me, your brother, right.
Star Arvizo: In every room.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you go to every room by yourself.
Star Arvizo: No, I was either with -- I was with someone.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you weren't always with Michael, right.
Star Arvizo: I was probably in the toy room with Prince and Paris and Grace.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you let them into the room.
Star Arvizo: What.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you use the code and let them into the room.
Star Arvizo: No. Grace knew the code.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm asking you if you remember how many times you think you've used these codes --
Star Arvizo: A lot of times.
Mr. Mesereau: -- to get into the rooms at Neverland. You said about 100, right.
Star Arvizo: No, I'm guessing. I'm just saying I used them a lot of times.
Mr. Mesereau: Why did you pick the number 100.
Star Arvizo: I don't know. I'm just trying to show that I used them a lot of times.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And you used them many times when Michael Jackson wasn't even at Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: He was there. It got you into the house. It got you into his bedroom. Got you into the front door.
Mr. Mesereau: But you've used those codes many times when Michael Jackson wasn't even at Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: When.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm asking you.
Star Arvizo: I never used them. What did you say.
Mr. Mesereau: No, let me rephrase it. You personally, Star Arvizo, have used those codes to get into rooms at Neverland when Michael Jackson wasn't even there, right.
Star Arvizo: No. No.
Mr. Mesereau: You're saying --
Star Arvizo: We barely learned those codes after the Miami trip. I never knew them before.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall ever being caught in the wine cellar --
Star Arvizo: The wine cellar doesn't have a combination lock.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall ever being caught in the wine cellar drinking wine when Michael Jackson wasn't present.
Star Arvizo: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Never happened.
Star Arvizo: It -- it's always locked, and it always -- it -- to unlock it you need a key. There's no combination to get in there.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me repeat my question. Do you recall ever being caught in the wine cellar at Neverland with Gavin drinking wine when Michael Jackson wasn't even there.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you saying that never happened.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you ever recall being caught at any other location in Neverland drinking wine when Michael Jackson wasn't there.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. That never happened.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you just told the jury voluntarily where the key is to get in the wine cellar, right.
Star Arvizo: No, I said that the door, the wine cellar needed a key to get in there.
Mr. Mesereau: And you knew where the key was, correct.
Star Arvizo: I knew it was in the lounge.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew where it was hanging in the lounge, right.
Star Arvizo: Not exactly. I didn't know where it was hanging. I just knew it was in the lounge.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, please describe the lounge for the jury.
Star Arvizo: It has a closet, a couch, a rest room with a shower. It was pretty small.
Mr. Mesereau: You've been in the lounge many times, haven't you.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times have you been in the lounge.
Star Arvizo: Once to put on a cooking shirt.
Mr. Mesereau: You've been in the lounge once to put on a cooking shirt.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's the lounge that's right next -- excuse me, that's right next to the wine cellar, correct.
Star Arvizo: No. The wine cellar's in the arcade, under -- downstairs.
Mr. Mesereau: How do you get into the wine cellar.
Star Arvizo: You push a jukebox out of the stairs, and you go downstairs.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you go downstairs, what do you see.
Star Arvizo: It's like a bomb shelter thing, almost. There's sleeping bags, there's pillows. There's like canned sausages and a bunch of, like, little Michael Jackson gold energy drinks. And you enter into another small room which has a bunch of wine and a bunch of alcohol in there.
Mr. Mesereau: And to get into that room with the wine, what do you have to do.
Star Arvizo: Need someone with a key.
Mr. Mesereau: And where do you find the key.
Star Arvizo: I don't know. I just knew it was in the lounge, and Jesus had one, and that's all I knew.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, how many times have you been down in the wine cellar.
Star Arvizo: Twice.
Mr. Mesereau: So when you described the lounge in detail, you weren't talking about the wine cellar, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You just described the little room right next to the wine cellar, right.
Star Arvizo: No, I described a room that's in the main house. The wine cellar's in the arcade.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Star Arvizo: Away from the house.
Mr. Mesereau: When you go into the wine cellar, you go downstairs, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What does that stairs look like.
Star Arvizo: It's wooden, and they go down. And they have steps.
Mr. Mesereau: And you go down the steps and what's the first thing you see.
Star Arvizo: A wall.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: A wall.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Star Arvizo: And then you look to your right and there's a door.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And what does the door look like.
Star Arvizo: It's wooden. And it looks like an old-fashioned door.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And if you're facing the door and you look to your left, what do you see.
Star Arvizo: A wall.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And if you're facing the door and you look to your right, what do you see.
Star Arvizo: The stairs leading up to the arcade.
Mr. Mesereau: Is there any room close to the wine cellar.
Star Arvizo: No except a little room upstairs in the arcade that had a bunch of books in it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And to get into that wine cellar, there's a key, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And the key was hanging in one location, correct.
Star Arvizo: I said I didn't know where the key was.
Mr. Mesereau: But you really did know where it was, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Not really.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: But you got the key one time yourself, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: I've never gotten the key myself.
Mr. Mesereau: You asked for the key, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: What.
Mr. Mesereau: You asked for the key to the wine cellar at one point, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: Never. Never.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew where the key was hanging --
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: -- because you were watched taking that key at one point, weren't you.
Star Arvizo: I never took the key at one point.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. So how many times have you been in the wine cellar, then.
Star Arvizo: Twice.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And you learned this description of the wine cellar by just being there twice, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you ever caught drinking wine in the guest quarters.
Star Arvizo: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Never once.
Star Arvizo: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Never touched it at the guest quarters, right.
Star Arvizo: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You gave a description of Michael's bedroom to the jury yesterday, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what did you tell the jury you'd find on the first floor.
Star Arvizo: The first floor.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. The first floor of Michael's bedroom, yes.
Star Arvizo: The room to the right or to the left.
Mr. Mesereau: Let's take the room to the left. What do you see in the room to the left.
Star Arvizo: All the way to the left.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: There's like -- there's a counter with a bunch of perfumes and colognes. There's a mirror. There's another big mirror behind it. There's speakers. There's a bunch of electric razors in a drawer. There's a big bathtub, Jacuzzi-type thing. There used to be a reclining chair there. It wasn't -- you couldn't -- it was -- it was like a square cushion, and there was a cushioned chair, and there's a dresser. There's a door with a small -- with a toilet in there. There's glass doors all the way to the end. There's a big safe in there. What else. There's a -- yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And how about the room to the right.
Star Arvizo: All the way to the right, there's another counter with a bunch of stuff on it. There's a poster of Harry Potter and his two friends. There's a rest room all the way, if you keep walking down, with a shower. There's a closet to your left with a bunch of clothes and a bunch of souvenirs from other movies. There's -- when you first walk in, there's a closet with a bunch of pajamas. And if you go to your left, there's the stairs going up. What else is there. There's a -- that's it.
Mr. Mesereau: You and your brother were caught in that room when Michael Jackson wasn't even at Neverland, weren't you.
Star Arvizo: To sleep, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: You and your brother used to go into that room when Michael wasn't even at Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes, Michael opened his room up to us so we could sleep there while he was gone.
Mr. Mesereau: You were actually asked to leave that room when you were caught during a time when Michael wasn't even at Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And you and your brother rummaged through every room in that bedroom area, correct.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You went snooping around the entire bedroom area when Michael wasn't even there, correct.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You went into that closet when Michael wasn't even there, correct.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: How do you know there are pajamas in the closet.
Star Arvizo: Because Michael showed us.
Mr. Mesereau: So Michael was showing you every little bit of the bedroom.
Star Arvizo: No, he just showed us where the pajamas were.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were never caught in there and asked to leave; is that what you're saying.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, referring to Exhibit 86 -- May I approach the witness, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
Mr. Mesereau: Star, I'm showing you a photograph that you identified yesterday. The number is 86. Do you see that.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's a briefcase with some girlie magazines, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the jury yesterday, they're the magazines you saw at Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And before you testified about these magazines -- May I show the jury this, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you. Shall I just hand it to them.
The Court: If that's what you would like.
Mr. Sanger: Tom, do you want to put it up on the screen.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure.
Mr. Sanger: I've turned this on.
The Bailiff: It would be “Input 4”.
The Court: It would be “4”.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, do you see that briefcase, Star.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what you're looking at is Exhibit 86, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't see the number.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Just -- what you're looking at is a -- appears to be a black briefcase with some girlie magazines, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And the first one says “Barely Legal” on it; do you see that.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And it appears to be a blonde woman lifting up her shirt, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And it appears to be a blonde woman who's exposing her breasts, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And she appears to be wearing a dark pair of shorts, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Before you testified yesterday you looked at that photograph with Prosecutor Sneddon, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Prosecutor Sneddon that those are the magazines you had seen at Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Prosecutor Sneddon that Michael Jackson had showed you those magazines, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Michael Jackson never showed you that magazine, “Barely Legal”, did he.
Star Arvizo: What.
Mr. Mesereau: Michael Jackson never showed you that magazine, “Barely Legal”, did he.
Star Arvizo: He did show us.
Mr. Mesereau: He did.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, Star, did you look at the date of the magazine. It's August of 2003, is it not.
Star Arvizo: Well, I never said that was exactly that one.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, your family had left Neverland many months before, never to return, correct.
Star Arvizo: That -- I'm telling you that that wasn't exactly the one he showed us.
Mr. Mesereau: That's not what you said yesterday, and it's not what you said today, right.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, that's argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: When you told the jury yesterday that Michael Jackson showed you the magazine “Barely Legal”, you were not telling the truth, right.
Star Arvizo: Um, I said that he did show us Barely Legal. I didn't say that he showed us that exact one. He showed us those magazines.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the jury yesterday that Michael showed you the particular magazine depicted in the photograph, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: No. I said that he showed us those type of magazines.
Mr. Mesereau: You're saying it now because you just found out what the date is, right.
Star Arvizo: I never said those were exactly the ones.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Did you discuss this issue with Prosecutor Sneddon this morning.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever discussed this issue with any prosecutor.
Star Arvizo: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever discussed this issue with any Santa Barbara Sheriff's officer.
Star Arvizo: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You testified yesterday to the jury that you found that briefcase cracked open, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, you and your brother were caught trying to get into that briefcase, weren't you.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You deny that anyone at Neverland ever caught you trying to get into the briefcase.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Are there any locks at Neverland other than the ones you described.
Star Arvizo: Any other.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: There's a lot more locks.
Mr. Mesereau: Please tell the jury where the other locks are.
Star Arvizo: Almost on every door.
Mr. Mesereau: And how do you get into those locks.
Star Arvizo: On every single door.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: Do you want me to explain every lock.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure, the ones you know about. Sure.
Star Arvizo: Mostly all locked from the inside, not -- I don't know what you're trying to ask me.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, I'd like you to tell the jury what you know about each lock at Neverland.
Star Arvizo: There's like hundreds of locks.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Let's take ten of them.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Wherever they may be. Just tell the jury what you know about those ten locks and where they are.
Star Arvizo: They all lock from the inside.
Mr. Mesereau: And how do you unlock them.
Star Arvizo: From the inside.
Mr. Mesereau: Is there any other way to unlock them.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you unlocked any of those locks, ever.
Star Arvizo: From the inside.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: Probably coming out of the rest room.
Mr. Mesereau: Which lock are you talking about.
Star Arvizo: The rest room lock.
Mr. Mesereau: What other locks have you unlocked at Neverland.
Star Arvizo: Um -- um -- rest room lock, door lock. What else. I can't really remember every lock I unlocked.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember testifying in front of the Santa Barbara grand jury.
Star Arvizo: A little, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember the prosecutor handed you a girlie magazine to look at.
Star Arvizo: When.
Mr. Mesereau: When you were in front of the Santa Barbara grand jury.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object; assumes facts not in evidence.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you ever asked to look at a girlie magazine when you testified in front of the Santa Barbara grand jury.
Star Arvizo: I was never handed a girlie magazine.
Mr. Mesereau: Has Mr. Sneddon ever shown you a girlie magazine during your interviews.
Star Arvizo: No, except on the -- on the photo that you just showed.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And when was that.
Star Arvizo: When.
Mr. Mesereau: When was that.
Star Arvizo: Just a moment ago.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Just a moment ago.
Star Arvizo: Yes. I'm talking about the picture you just showed a moment ago.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Yes. He showed you that picture, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes. In the grand jury.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you testify in the grand jury that you saw these magazines.
Star Arvizo: No, I said I saw those types of magazines.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Mr. Arvizo --
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: -- you told Mr. Sneddon, in no uncertain terms, that those were the magazines you had seen, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: I said those -- those are the type of magazines we saw.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Had you ever seen any girlie magazines in your life before you say Michael Jackson showed them to you.
Star Arvizo: Hmm, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Never.
Star Arvizo: Well, I was only like 11, 12.
Mr. Mesereau: Weren't you caught at Neverland looking in girlie magazines.
Star Arvizo: I said no.
Mr. Mesereau: No one ever caught you and your brother looking at girlie magazines at Neverland.
Star Arvizo: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. And your testimony is until you got to Neverland, you and your brother had never looked at a girlie magazine at any time; is that right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Before you got to Neverland, had you ever used a computer.
Star Arvizo: Yes. In school.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you ever used one at home.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm a little late on the trigger on this one, but I want to object to that as vague and have it stricken in terms of what point in time we're talking about.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll rephrase it, Your Honor.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: Could the question and the answer be stricken, please.
The Court: Denied.
Mr. Mesereau: Before your first visit to Neverland, had you ever used a computer.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know anything about computers before you made your first visit to Neverland.
Star Arvizo: I knew I could punch in some keys and I could spell a word.
Mr. Mesereau: And where had you learned to do that.
Star Arvizo: At school, at word-processing class.
Mr. Mesereau: Before you were first interviewed by the Santa Barbara Sheriffs, did you know anything about computers.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what did you know about computers at that point.
Star Arvizo: How to type and how to surf the net.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew how to surf the net before you first went to Neverland, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: I didn't even know we had Internet. Well, I might have, but never really --
Mr. Mesereau: You say you might have.
Star Arvizo: Yeah, I might have, but I never really saw the point of going there.
Mr. Mesereau: When you were first interviewed by the Santa Barbara Sheriffs, you told them about what you've claimed Michael Jackson and Frank did with a computer, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the Santa Barbara Sheriffs that they found a site like the AOL, right.
Star Arvizo: Like the AOL.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: Well, I was kind of nervous -- I was kind of nervous in that interview. I might have dropped off on half of my sentence.
Mr. Mesereau: You were kind of nervous in the interview and you might have dropped off like half of your sentence.
Star Arvizo: Yes. Whenever -- well, that's how I speak. Whenever I'm nervous, I cut off part of my sentence. Or -- I don't know, I'm just -- that's how I am.
Mr. Mesereau: Has anyone showed you a record of your interview before you testified today.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Who.
Star Arvizo: D.A.'s Office.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me.
Star Arvizo: The D.A.'s Office.
Mr. Mesereau: Who in the D.A.'s Office showed you a transcript of your interview before you testified today.
Star Arvizo: What interview. The Santa Barbara.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: It was mailed to me.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know who mailed it to you.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know when you received it.
Star Arvizo: About a month ago.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you read it.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't read it at all.
Star Arvizo: Well, I did read it towards the end.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you read the whole thing.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you then discuss that transcript with anybody.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never.
Star Arvizo: No. Tom told us not to.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, I haven't showed you that portion of the transcript yet today, right.
Star Arvizo: What.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I object as vague.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll rephrase it. I'll rephrase.
Mr. Mesereau: The part of the transcript where you told the sheriffs about AOL - okay --.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: -- when did you last see that page.
Star Arvizo: I don't even remember seeing it.
Mr. Mesereau: You never saw it.
Star Arvizo: No, I don't remember seeing it, but it was probably in there.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, I'll represent to you that your sentence does sort of break off.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Star Arvizo: A lot of my sentences do.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you know that sentence broke off.
Star Arvizo: Because when I'm nervous, that's how I talk.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: When I'm nervous, that's how I talk.
Mr. Mesereau: You clearly looked at that before you testified today, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: No. I didn't look at those papers.
Mr. Mesereau: Never looked at them once.
Star Arvizo: No. Probably looked at them when I got up here, when -- no, not right here, but when I came up to Santa Barbara.
Mr. Mesereau: When you came up to Santa Barbara, you're saying you looked at your transcript of your police interview, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I'm sorry, I'm not understanding what you're saying. And if I'm not being clear, just tell me. Okay.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: There was a point in your sheriff's interview where you talked about Frank and Michael Jackson showing you a computer, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes. It was the -- that was the same computer my brother had.
Mr. Mesereau: And is that a computer that Michael Jackson gave to your brother.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know when he gave it to him.
Star Arvizo: During the first visit.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you told the Santa Barbara Sheriffs, like you told the jury yesterday, that during that first visit, Michael Jackson and Frank showed you the computer, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs they looked at a site like AOL, correct.
Star Arvizo: I don't -- I don't know what I meant by saying that.
Mr. Mesereau: But you said it.
Star Arvizo: I know. I probably cut off the sentence.
Mr. Mesereau: You're saying that you told the sheriffs it was a site like AOL, but you don't know what AOL means.
Star Arvizo: I probably meant we probably went on AOL and we found a site there.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know what “AOL” means.
Star Arvizo: It's an Internet company.
Mr. Mesereau: When you told the Santa Barbara Sheriffs you went on a site --
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: -- like AOL, you knew how to use the Internet, right.
Star Arvizo: No. I don't remember saying that.
Mr. Mesereau: When you were first interviewed by the Santa Barbara Sheriffs --
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: First interview, okay.
Star Arvizo: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: You told them Michael Jackson and Frank showed you and your brother a site on the computer, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told them it was a site like AOL, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew what AOL was when you mentioned that, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Why did you just tell the jury you didn't know.
Star Arvizo: I knew it after my brother was -- was, I don't know, I don't know, was connected or -- I don't know the word, but when he was -- because when Michael gave him the laptop, he had someone call him and set up an AOL account for my brother for his laptop.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You and your brother had looked at Internet sites before you ever visited Neverland, hadn't you.
Star Arvizo: No. I had -- I was -- never really used the Internet.
Mr. Mesereau: Your brother had, as far as you know, right.
Star Arvizo: No. I never -- never really monitored my brother.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: I never really monitored my brother.
Mr. Mesereau: When Michael Jackson gave your brother a computer --
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: -- you and your brother already knew how to use it, correct.
Star Arvizo: No. He called someone to hook it up. Well, talked to my brother on the phone of how to hook it up.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the police in your first interview you looked at www dot p-u-s-s-y dot com.
Star Arvizo: No, I was making an example that I was trying to say, that wasn't the exact site. I'm just saying, I was just making an example.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You also told the police you might have looked at www dot t-e-e-n p-u-s-s-y dot com, right.
Star Arvizo: No. I never said that.
Mr. Mesereau: You never said that to the sheriffs.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you their report.
Star Arvizo: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page.
Star Arvizo: Yes, but --
Mr. Mesereau: “But” what.
Star Arvizo: I never said that. That's just a paragraph that somebody wrote.
Mr. Mesereau: So you never said that to the Santa Barbara Sheriffs --
Star Arvizo: I might have, but I don't remember saying it.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you are saying that if it appears in a report, it's wrong.
Star Arvizo: Well, I'm saying I never remember saying it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Star, you and your brother were caught at Neverland looking at computer sites when Michael wasn't even there, right.
Star Arvizo: There's no computers at Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Your brother had one.
Star Arvizo: At the beginning. But then it broke, and then we never had it again. And the only other computer there was Frank's computer, and Frank took it everywhere he went.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you never were caught by anybody --
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: -- looking at adult material sites on a computer.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that correct.
Star Arvizo: There's no computers in Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, did you tell the sheriffs that Michael Jackson kept your family away from clocks.
Star Arvizo: Well, we never knew the time.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, did you tell the Santa Barbara Sheriffs that, “Michael Jackson would never let us look at clocks”, or words to that effect.
Star Arvizo: Words -- could I see it.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm just asking you.
Star Arvizo: No. Well, yes. Probably said it to an extent like that.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, just tell the jury, if you would, how you remember saying it.
Star Arvizo: I just remember saying that -- I don't remember how exactly how I said it.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you said words to the effect, “Michael Jackson kept my family away from clocks and time”, right.
Star Arvizo: Were those my exact words.
Mr. Mesereau: No, I'm saying, words to that effect. Do you remember exactly how you said it to the sheriff.
Star Arvizo: No. I don't know exactly.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember roughly how you said it to the sheriffs.
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you say anything like that to the sheriffs.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Please tell the jury what you told the sheriffs.
Star Arvizo: I'm going to be guessing, because I don't know my exact words.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I'm not asking for your exact words. I'm just asking you for generally what you said.
Star Arvizo: They kept us away from the clocks. We didn't know the exact time or the date or nothing.
Mr. Mesereau: Would you agree that overlooking Neverland is a huge clock.
Star Arvizo: Yes. It's a flower clock.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. And to the right of that big flower clock is another clock, correct.
Star Arvizo: Probably.
Mr. Mesereau: There are clocks all over Neverland, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you and your brothers used to run all around Neverland, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You wanted the sheriffs to think that you and your family were imprisoned and kept away from clocks.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: That's why you told them that lie, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: If there are clocks all over Neverland, if there's a big flower clock on a hill overlooking Neverland, and if you and your brothers were running freely around Neverland, why did you tell the Santa Barbara Sheriffs “We were kept away from clocks and time”.
Star Arvizo: Because they were wrong and we were kept away from them. We weren't able to know the time.
Mr. Mesereau: Your mother told you to say that, didn't she.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: It was a lie, wasn't it.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: It defies common sense, doesn't it.
Star Arvizo: Can you explain that.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know what that means.
Star Arvizo: I know what common sense is.
Mr. Mesereau: Everywhere you go at Neverland, you can see clocks, right.
Star Arvizo: Not everywhere.
Mr. Mesereau: Most places, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes, most places.
Mr. Mesereau: And you and your brother were up on a hill --
Star Arvizo: They weren't always correct. Yeah, they had clocks there, but they weren't always correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, if you didn't know what time it was, how do you know they weren't correct.
Star Arvizo: Because the clocks were -- one clock was saying five o'clock and another clock was saying nine o'clock. That's how I knew they were wrong.
Mr. Mesereau: Star, you knew what time it was at Neverland, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Object as argumentative, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever send letters or cards to Michael Jackson.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know when you did that.
Star Arvizo: When we first met Michael.
Mr. Mesereau: And approximately when was that again.
Star Arvizo: When I was 10, 11.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know approximately when you first met Michael.
Star Arvizo: While my brother was having cancer.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that probably the fall of 2000.
Star Arvizo: I don't know the date.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it 2001.
Star Arvizo: I don't know the date.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it 2002.
Star Arvizo: I just know it was between when my brother was having cancer.
Mr. Mesereau: Did your mother help you write your letters to Michael.
Star Arvizo: Hmm, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you write them yourself.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You wrote a letter to Michael, Star, where you said -- you thanked him, “Because even when your hearts get broken and shattered into tiny little pieces, we always still love, need and care about you with every tiny little piece of our hearts”, right.
Star Arvizo: Are you reading that from a card.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm asking you if you remember saying anything like that.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never said it.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you a card --
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: -- that you sent to Michael.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, could I see the card before counsel shows him.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure. My mistake.
Mr. Sneddon: That's okay. My mistake; I just didn't....
Mr. Mesereau: May I have this marked as the exhibit next in order, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Excuse me, Your Honor. If he's going to refresh the individual's recollection first, and that --
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me, Your Honor, I'm doing it.
The Court: He's changed his --
Mr. Sneddon: I object.
The Court: He's changed his approach.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm doing it.
The Court: He was going to refresh. Now he's asking if the exhibit may be marked. He can have the exhibit marked.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
The Clerk: It's 5001.
Mr. Mesereau: 5001.
Mr. Sneddon: No objection that it come in.
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, that would be a card and an envelope. Would you like them to be two exhibits or can they be the same.
The Court: I think they can be the same.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Thank you.
Mr. Mesereau: Star, I'm going to show you a card and envelope that have been marked as Exhibit 5001. Okay.
Star Arvizo: I think I wrote this off another card.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you did write it, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you seen that before.
Star Arvizo: I haven't seen this in a long time.
Mr. Mesereau: But that's your handwriting, isn't it.
Star Arvizo: Yes, when I was really little. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And how about the envelope. Have you seen that envelope, the purple envelope. Have you seen that before.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That's the envelope the card came in.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember if the envelope came with this card.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you gave Michael Jackson your phone number, right, at the bottom.
Star Arvizo: Looks like it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Star Arvizo: Wait. I don't remember that being my phone number. But if it is, it was.
Mr. Mesereau: I would move this document into evidence, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: I already said no objection, Your Honor.
The Court: It's admitted.
Mr. Mesereau: You said to Michael Jackson, “My super, super, best, best friend”, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said, “I love you, I love you”, repeatedly, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you referred to Father's Day, right.
Star Arvizo: I didn't read the card.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you the envelope.
Star Arvizo: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Star Arvizo: “Happy Father's Day”.
Mr. Mesereau: Yeah, you said “Happy Father's Day” on the envelope, right.
Star Arvizo: Wait. Can I see it one more time.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure. May I.
The Court: Yes.
Star Arvizo: Sorry. Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You sent the card on Father's Day, correct.
Star Arvizo: Sure. I don't remember, but, okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Mr. Jackson, “You always heal us in a very special way”, right.
Star Arvizo: I wrote that off another card.
Mr. Mesereau: What other card did you write that off of.
Star Arvizo: It was a card that already had it written on there.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did you get that card.
Star Arvizo: Probably from a supermarket or --
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me.
Star Arvizo: Probably from a supermarket.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you took a card from a supermarket --
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: -- and wrote the words.
Star Arvizo: It was a card lying around. My grandmother got a lot of cards from her grandchildren.
Mr. Mesereau: You said, “Michael, you are special to us”, right.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: “We loyally and faithfully love you more”, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: “We love you unconditionally, to infinity and beyond forever”, right.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said, “Thank you, Michael, for being our family”, right.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: “Love, your Blow Hole, Star Arvizo”, right.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: 626-452-1693, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't even remember having that phone number, but --
Mr. Mesereau: The card is signed “Davellin, Gavin, Star and me”, right.
Star Arvizo: “Me”. Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, there's other people's writings on there also, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you all used to write to Michael and tell him about how he had healed your family, right.
Star Arvizo: What do you mean. We never -- we probably wrote to him like --
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: I only wrote to him, like, three times.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you would write to him and tell him how he had healed your family, true.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember that.
Mr. Mesereau: Your mother would ask you to do that, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And your family often referred to Michael as a father figure, right.
Star Arvizo: Um, sure.
Mr. Mesereau: You did that often, right.
Star Arvizo: Refer to him as a father figure.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. You always referred to Michael as being part of your family, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: Yes. Part of our family.
Mr. Mesereau: Your mother used to do that, correct.
Star Arvizo: What do you mean.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know what I mean.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Your mother used to refer to Michael Jackson as being part of your family, didn't she.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object as to vague as to time.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll rephrase it, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: From the time you first met Michael Jackson, you used to refer to him as being part of your family, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: From the time your mother first met Michael Jackson, she used to refer to him as being part of your family, right.
Star Arvizo: I can't speak for my mom.
Mr. Mesereau: You never heard her say that.
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: From the time your sister first met Michael Jackson, she used to refer to him as being part of the family, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever hear her say that.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: But you started doing it yourself, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you say you did it by copying a card from a supermarket.
Star Arvizo: Yes, I just plugged his name in.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So this handwriting of yours all comes from a supermarket card; is that correct.
Star Arvizo: No, not from a supermarket card. I rewrote the supermarket card.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So when you said to Michael, “Thank you, Michael, because even when our hearts are and get broken and shattered into tiny little pieces, we always still love, need and care about you with every tiny little piece of our hearts, because you always heal us in a very special way”, did you get that from a supermarket card.
Star Arvizo: I plugged some words in, I plugged his name in, and that's how I got that paragraph.
Mr. Mesereau: And you recall sending it to him.
Star Arvizo: What.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall sending it to him.
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall giving it to him.
Star Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Yesterday you told the jury that when you were interviewed on that rebuttal tape and your family said things about Michael healing Gavin and being a father, that that was something scripted, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: But nobody scripted the words in this card, did they.
Star Arvizo: No. But that was before all that happened.
Mr. Mesereau: Before what happened, Star.
Star Arvizo: Before the Miami trip, and before we finally left.
Mr. Mesereau: So what you're saying is before the Miami trip, you always, you and your family always referred to Michael as “Daddy” and as someone who would heal.
Star Arvizo: We never had a constant connection with Michael during that time.
Mr. Mesereau: Then why would you write a card like this to him.
Star Arvizo: Probably when we came back from Neverland. I don't know. I was really little when I wrote that card.
Mr. Mesereau: Your mother asked you to write it, didn't she.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Your mother never asked you to write to Michael.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Your mother -- how old were you when you wrote the card; do you think.
Star Arvizo: Probably -- I don't know. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, how old do you think you were. Ten. Nine.
Star Arvizo: I can't guess. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, how old are you now.
Star Arvizo: 14.
Mr. Mesereau: We're talking about a couple of years ago, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't know. I don't want to say the wrong age.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: I don't want to say the wrong age.
Mr. Mesereau: No, just do your best. Just estimate. We're talking about a couple of years ago, correct.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Huh.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, how long ago do you think you were visiting Neverland.
Star Arvizo: Back in 2000 and 2001.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. How old do you think you were in 2000 and 2001.
Star Arvizo: Ten.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you saying that when you were ten years old nobody told you what words to write on this card.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You wrote it all yourself when you were ten.
Star Arvizo: No, the card helped me.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, what about the words, “When we get broken and shattered into tiny little pieces we always still love, need and care about you with every tiny little piece of our hearts, because you always heal us in a very special way”. Did you make those words up at the age of 10.
Star Arvizo: No, the card did.
Mr. Mesereau: The card did.
Star Arvizo: Yes. The card already had them written on there.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, I see, so you took a card and copied it.
Star Arvizo: Yes, I told you.
Mr. Mesereau: And your mother wasn't involved in that.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And your father wasn't involved in that.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And Gavin wasn't involved in that.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And Davellin wasn't involved in that, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You did it all yourself, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Then how come you got other family members writing on the same card.
Star Arvizo: Well, they probably wrote on the card after I was done with it.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see them do that.
Star Arvizo: No, I just wrote on it, and I left it there.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you saying they probably did that, or you know they did that.
Star Arvizo: They probably did that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But what you're telling the jury - and correct me if I'm wrong - is long before the rebuttal video, your family was referring to Michael as “Daddy”, and as someone who had healed the family, true.
Mr. Sneddon: Object, Your Honor, as compound.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll rephrase it, Your Honor. I think it is compound.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Mesereau: Long before the rebuttal film, your family was referring to Michael as a father figure, right.
Star Arvizo: It was long before the Miami trip, too.
Mr. Mesereau: You say long before it.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, in the year --
Star Arvizo: And --
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: And my brother was referring to him as a father figure.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Long before the Miami trip, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And long before the Miami trip, your mother was referring to him as a father figure, right.
Star Arvizo: My brother.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that true.
Star Arvizo: Yes, my brother needed a father at that time. He was barely coming out of his terminal illness.
Mr. Mesereau: And long before the Miami trip, you were referring to Michael Jackson as a father figure, right.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember doing it, but okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, did you do that.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't do it.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: What about the card.
Star Arvizo: So. That's what -- that's what the card had on it, so I -- I rewrit it on a piece of paper and -- and I plugged in his name.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, “Blow Hole” was a nickname for a fish, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Your nickname was based on a fish, right.
Star Arvizo: I made it up. I was going to give it to Michael. We had a rock/paper/scissors, I lost, so I got stuck with that name.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember meeting with Psychologist Stanley Katz to talk about what you claim Michael Jackson did to your mother. Do you remember that.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Stanley Katz that Michael Jackson gave you red wine and vodka, correct.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember saying that.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you his testimony.
Star Arvizo: Whose testimony.
Mr. Mesereau: Stanley Katz.
Star Arvizo: I never said that to him, so --
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you what he says you told him.
Star Arvizo: That's what he said.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you what he said.
Star Arvizo: Okay, but it's not going to help.
Mr. Mesereau: It's not going to help you.
Star Arvizo: Yeah, I remember saying red and white wine, and there's one time we got vodka, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Stanley Katz that you were given vodka.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: But yesterday you told the jury it was just wine, right.
Star Arvizo: I forgot.
Mr. Mesereau: You might have forgot yesterday.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told Stanley Katz that the first time you observed your brother in bed with Michael Jackson, that Michael Jackson had put his hand on your brother's crotch, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You then changed that to say he had put his hand inside your brother's pants, right.
Star Arvizo: He might have said it, but I know what I said.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Star Arvizo: Repeat the question.
Mr. Mesereau: Originally, you told Stanley Katz that Michael Jackson had put his hand near your brother's crotch, right.
Star Arvizo: Near.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you said he put his hand on his crotch, correct.
Star Arvizo: In his underwears.
Mr. Mesereau: And as time went on, after interview and after interview, you changed that to masturbation, true.
Star Arvizo: Masturbating my brother.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase it.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Stanley Katz that the first time you saw Michael Jackson in bed with your brother, the time you went up the stairs, that Michael Jackson had put his hand on your brother's crotch, right.
Star Arvizo: When they were going up the stairs.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: While they were going up the stairs.
Mr. Mesereau: While you're going up the stairs.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase it. Don't answer it if you're confused. Okay.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the jury yesterday you went up the stairs one night, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You got into the room yourself, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said the bell went off, right.
Star Arvizo: When I first walked in through the hallway, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And even though the bell went off, you kept going up the stairs, right.
Star Arvizo: The bell went off while I was -- made my way through the hallway.
Mr. Mesereau: The bell went off when you opened the door, didn't it.
Star Arvizo: No, it stopped.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Star Arvizo: It stopped.
Mr. Mesereau: It just stopped.
Star Arvizo: Yeah. It goes for a couple more minutes and then it stops.
Mr. Mesereau: And then what happens.
Star Arvizo: That's it.
Mr. Mesereau: It never goes on again.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: It goes off so Michael can hear it, correct.
Star Arvizo: If the door's closed, you can't hear nothing.
Mr. Mesereau: Can't hear anything upstairs.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that what you're saying.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. The bell goes off. You say Michael doesn't hear it, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you say that you open his door to the stairway, right, and you say you go upstairs, right.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: The first one you say you describe that to was Stanley Katz, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Stanley Katz that Michael Jackson had his left hand on Gavin's crotch, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Never told him that Michael Jackson was masturbating Gavin.
Star Arvizo: He wasn't masturbating. He was just feeling.
Mr. Mesereau: He was just feeling him.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember yesterday you told the jury he was masturbating him.
Star Arvizo: No, I said Michael was feeling my brother while he was masturbating.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever tell the jury yesterday that Michael was masturbating your brother.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever tell that to anybody.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember when you described for Stanley Katz the second time you claim Michael Jackson was observed by you in bed with your brother. Do you remember that.
Star Arvizo: What.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling Stanley Katz there was a second time that you went up the stairs and observed Michael Jackson touching your brother.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell Stanley Katz that Michael Jackson had his hand on your brother's crotch.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That's really not what you told him at all, is it.
Star Arvizo: What are you talking about.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you told Stanley Katz that Michael Jackson was rubbing his penis against Gavin's buttocks, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: When. The second time.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Did you tell Stanley Katz that.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you his grand jury testimony.
Star Arvizo: I know what I said, though.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you denying telling Psychologist Stanley Katz --
Star Arvizo: The second time.
Mr. Mesereau: -- that you told him the second time you observed Michael Jackson touching your brother in bed, that Michael Jackson was rubbing his penis against your brother's buttocks.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You never told that to Stanley Katz.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: If I showed you his testimony, would that jog your memory.
Star Arvizo: No. I know what I said, though.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You tried to tell Stanley Katz that you smelled marijuana, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: I don't know how marijuana smells.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you tell Stanley Katz you smelled marijuana.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you that page of his testimony.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, are you saying that you never told Michael Jackson you wanted to be an actor.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never told him that at all, right.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. To your knowledge, did your mother ever tell Michael Jackson you wanted to be an actor.
Star Arvizo: I can't speak for her.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever hear her say that.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You went to dancing classes, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what school did you go to.
Star Arvizo: I went to Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy's Dance Studio. I went to -- where else did I go. I went to ballet classes, rhythm/tap, a little bit of jazz. What else. That's it.
Mr. Mesereau: And you went to comedy class, right.
Star Arvizo: Sure. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you go to comedy class.
Star Arvizo: In the summer. In the summer.
Mr. Mesereau: What summer was that.
Star Arvizo: In between third and fourth.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you trying to learn to be a comedian.
Star Arvizo: No, I just wanted to do it for fun.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Ever tell anyone you wanted to be a comedian.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you told the Santa Barbara Sheriffs that Frank threatened you and your family, right.
Star Arvizo: He just threatened me.
Mr. Mesereau: He just threatened you alone.
Star Arvizo: He probably threatened my family.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he threaten you alone.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know when that was.
Star Arvizo: I don't know the date.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it when you first got to Neverland.
Star Arvizo: I don't really remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it after the Miami trip.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know how soon after the Miami trip.
Star Arvizo: I think it was right before the rebuttal.
Mr. Mesereau: Right before the rebuttal.
Star Arvizo: I was trying to go talk to my mom.
Mr. Mesereau: So this would be before, if I represent to you the rebuttal was June 20th, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me, February 20th, pardon me. February 20th was the rebuttal tape, right.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: And you're saying that Frank threatened you right before the rebuttal tape.
Star Arvizo: While I was trying to walk to my mom's guest unit.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But it was -- as far as you know, it's before the rebuttal tape, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And in one of your sheriffs' interviews, you were asked why Frank made that threat, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the sheriffs, “Because he already knew that what Michael did to us, and if we told them the truth, he would have went to jail”, right.
Star Arvizo: Can I read that.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember saying that to the sheriffs.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told them, essentially, that Frank said that to you, threatened you, because he knew that if you told anybody what Michael had done, Michael would go to jail, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That was right before the rebuttal tape, right.
Star Arvizo: I think so, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you discussed the charges in this case with the sheriffs.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have they told you they're claiming that molestation went on starting the 20th of June.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: February, I mean. Have they told you that.
Star Arvizo: Okay. No, they haven't told me.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever give them dates.
Star Arvizo: No. I knew more back then than I do now.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew more back then than you do now.
Star Arvizo: Yes, it was fresh in my memory back then.
Mr. Mesereau: Did someone tell you to say that.
Star Arvizo: No, I'm saying it right now, because I have school, I have tests to study for, and most of that stuff leave my memory, most of the details.
Mr. Mesereau: That's because you're studying for tests in school.
Star Arvizo: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you think if you weren't studying for tests in school, you'd know a lot more today.
Star Arvizo: It's not just tests. It's just learning.
Mr. Mesereau: So the learning you've done in school has interfered with your memory about this case.
Star Arvizo: No, I know -- I know -- I know everything happened. I just don't know it in detail like I did in those testimonies.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. You had a lot of details yesterday, didn't you.
Star Arvizo: Well, yeah. I do remember details. But not all the details.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you said you've reviewed a transcript of your police interview, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes. I didn't memorize 300 pages.
Mr. Mesereau: They told you to memorize it.
Star Arvizo: No, I'm just telling you I didn't memorize them. I just read through them.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, where did you get 300 pages.
Star Arvizo: I'm just saying, I'm just giving you an example.
Mr. Mesereau: Please tell the jury how many pages you were mailed to review before you testified.
Star Arvizo: I didn't count them.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately how many.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you just say 300.
Star Arvizo: I was showing you an example.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And when did you get these pages, however many there were.
Star Arvizo: When did I get them.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Star Arvizo: About a month ago.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know where they came from.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: No idea.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: They just popped up in the mail.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you got them, what did you do.
Star Arvizo: I didn't read them.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did you put them.
Star Arvizo: Put them right near my bed.
Mr. Mesereau: Never looked at them again.
Star Arvizo: No. Until -- until I almost came up here.
Mr. Mesereau: So when you almost came up here, you looked at those pages for the first time, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And how many of them did you look at.
Star Arvizo: How many.
Mr. Mesereau: Yeah. Roughly.
Star Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you look at all of them.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did someone tell you to read them.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Who.
Star Arvizo: Tom.
Mr. Mesereau: Prosecutor Sneddon.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Told you to read all the pages, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes. Just to look through them.
Mr. Mesereau: Told you to read them, to get ready for your testimony in this case, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes. Just to look through them.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's how you knew your sentence to the sheriffs about AOL dropped off and wasn't completed, right.
Star Arvizo: I didn't know about that.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't know about that.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you just testify about that.
Star Arvizo: I said I read through them.
Mr. Mesereau: Read through what.
Star Arvizo: My transcripts.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You read through them because Prosecutor Sneddon wanted you to make sure that you testified consistently with what you had in the reports, right.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that what he said.
Star Arvizo: No. He just told me to thumb through them, to look through them.
Mr. Mesereau: He told you just to thumb through them.
Star Arvizo: No, just to look through them.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, when did he do this.
Star Arvizo: Hmm, about a month ago.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you do what he asked you to do.
Star Arvizo: No. I had school to concentrate on. I had a final.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you didn't do what Prosecutor Sneddon asked you to do; isn't that correct.
Star Arvizo: I eventually did it.
Mr. Mesereau: Eventually you did. And can you just tell us when.
Star Arvizo: What.
Mr. Mesereau: Can you just tell us when you eventually did what Prosecutor Sneddon asked you to do.
Star Arvizo: Four weeks after he told me, or three weeks.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And was that in the last month.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: So you read all the documents you were sent by Prosecutor Sneddon, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes. I didn't memorize them. I just read them and -- yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, did anyone tell you to memorize them.
Star Arvizo: No, I'm telling you I didn't memorize all those pages.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember telling the Santa Barbara Sheriffs that there's a big telescope on a hill at Neverland that you and Gavin used to look through.
Star Arvizo: We looked through once or twice, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And describe for the jury where that telescope is, if you would.
Star Arvizo: It's on a hill right before you enter the -- the second gate into the ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: And from that hill, can you get a view of Neverland.
Star Arvizo: Yes. You can also view into a guest unit.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the sheriffs that you and Gavin used to look through that telescope into the guest units, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes, we saw into one guest unit where my mom was staying.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you used to kind of look at your mom through the telescope, right.
Star Arvizo: No, no, we just -- we were looking and we saw a guest unit, and then we continued looking somewhere else.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you look into the window of that guest unit.
Star Arvizo: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's where your mom was, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You saw your mom, right.
Star Arvizo: All you saw was her television and her bed. But you didn't -- you saw like a part of her bed. You didn't see her complete bed.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see her in the unit.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: But your testimony was that your mom never came out of the guest quarters, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember -- strike that. Did you ever see your mom dancing with Michael Jackson.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever go into the theater with your -- with Michael Jackson and your mom.
Star Arvizo: I went in the theater a lot of times.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever go into the theater with your mom, Michael, Davellin and Gavin.
Star Arvizo: Yes, to watch a movie.
Mr. Mesereau: And how often did you do that.
Star Arvizo: My mom rarely came out.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, but you just said -- first you said she never went out. Then you admitted you'd been in the theater with her, right.
Star Arvizo: I was thinking about something else.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Star Arvizo: You kind of got it mixed into my memory.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I don't want to mix you up. First you said your mom never came out of the guest cottage, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And then you admitted she'd been in the theater with Michael and the family, right.
Star Arvizo: And I told you that my memories got mixed in and I said something else.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I'm just trying to find out what the truth is, if I can.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you were in the theater with your mom, Michael, Gavin and Davellin, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes. But then I said after that, that no, she wasn't, because she wasn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So your mom never was in the theater you're saying now, right.
Star Arvizo: She probably was, but I wasn't there. I just remember going in there and watching movies.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Now, the telescope on the hill is a telescope that you and your brother used to look through, correct.
Star Arvizo: It was twice we looked through the telescope.
Mr. Mesereau: And does the telescope move.
Star Arvizo: Yes. Moves in all directions.
Mr. Mesereau: And if you take that telescope, you can see the clocks at Neverland, can't you.
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Can you.
Star Arvizo: Trees were in the way.
Mr. Mesereau: Trees are in the way.
Star Arvizo: Yes. There's a lot of trees at Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: You can't see one clock from that telescope.
Star Arvizo: Which clock are you referring to.
Mr. Mesereau: Any of them.
Star Arvizo: There was, like, two clocks right beside each other and a clock way over there by the carnival. You can see the hands on that clock.
Mr. Mesereau: That's the clock by the carnival.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said there are two other clocks you mentioned.
Star Arvizo: Well, there's one big clock.
Mr. Mesereau: Right. One big clock.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Can you see that through the telescope.
Star Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: What clocks can you see through the telescope.
Star Arvizo: The one by the carnival, but it's too small to look through. I mean, it's too small to see the hands moving.
Mr. Mesereau: What about the big flower clock --
Star Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: -- on the hill that overlooks Neverland. Can you see that through the telescope.
Star Arvizo: No, the trees are in the way.
Mr. Mesereau: You're sure of that.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you try to do it.
Star Arvizo: Not really. We were looking; we just wanted to look through it. We weren't trying to look for time. We were just looking through it, because -- because it was up there, so we were just trying to look through it.
Mr. Mesereau: You're making up that trees block your view through the telescope, aren't you --
Star Arvizo: I'm just saying --
Mr. Mesereau: -- Star.
Star Arvizo: -- I never really expected to look for a clock. I just looked through it. I remember trees and probably -- yeah. I remember trees, but I never really -- the telescope was up there, so me and my brother tried to look through it.
Mr. Mesereau: Why did you just tell the jury that trees prevent you from seeing clocks through the telescope on the hill that overlooks Neverland.
Star Arvizo: What does it matter. I mean, even when you're down there, you can see the clock. When you're driving the car. I don't know what you're trying to get at.
Mr. Mesereau: What else have you seen through that telescope on the hill that overlooks Neverland.
Star Arvizo: Rides. And trees.
Mr. Mesereau: What else.
Star Arvizo: And the guest unit.
Mr. Mesereau: What else.
Star Arvizo: Hills.
Mr. Mesereau: Can you see the theater.
Star Arvizo: Never really tried to see the theater.
Mr. Mesereau: Can you see the main house.
Star Arvizo: Probably. I don't know. I never really tried.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, did you and your brother take that telescope and look all over Neverland on that hill with the telescope that you've described moves.
Star Arvizo: It's -- okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you look all over Neverland at that -- through that moving telescope.
Star Arvizo: No, we just looked through it. We didn't try to examine the whole Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: How far away, if you know, is the guest unit from that telescope, if you know.
Star Arvizo: I don't know, but I could guess.
Mr. Mesereau: But you say you were up there only twice with your brother, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know what time of day that was.
Star Arvizo: Daylight. Daytime.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And certainly you've been to Neverland at night, right.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you noticed that these clocks are lit up at night.
Star Arvizo: The flower clock.
Mr. Mesereau: Any of them.
Star Arvizo: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: You've noticed they're lit up at night, haven't you.
Star Arvizo: I just noticed that the train station is lit up, and so is the flower clock. I can't -- there's the flower clock overlooking Neverland. Not overlooking. It's right there.
Mr. Mesereau: Right up on a hill above the main house, correct.
Star Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You've seen that clock lit at night, true.
Star Arvizo: I don't remember if it was lit, but it was probably lit, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, why do you tell the jury it was probably lit.
Star Arvizo: I don't know. I'm trying to remember.
The Court: Is this a good place to stop, Counsel.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. Remember the admonition, and I'll see you tomorrow morning at 8:30.
Adjourn Message: The proceedings adjourned at 11:30 a.m.
