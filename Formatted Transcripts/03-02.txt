Start of Day Message: Santa Maria, California Wednesday, March 2, 2005 8:30 a.m.
The Court: Good morning.
Counsel At Counsel Table: (In unison) Good morning, Your Honor. Good morning, Your Honor.
The Jury: (In unison) Good morning.
The Court: Sorry we kept you waiting a short time this morning. This is going to occur -- is the mike -- can you hear me? Is that better?
A Voice: Can't hear you.
The Court: Should be on now. They can't hear. What I'm going to do -- Would the witness step down for a moment, please? Can you hear me now?
The Jury: (In unison) Yes.
The Court: I sound like one of those commercials for the cell phone; "Can you hear me now?" I want to talk to you a little bit about the reason we were late this morning. We were -- we really weren't late. The attorneys and I were working on a legal problem that arose at the end of the day yesterday. And that's the nature of a lawsuit. It's a work in progress. And it's not all determined before you get here, and then it just happens. It happens in front of you. And so there's a couple of things that I want to tell you. And I think perhaps the best thing to do is to talk to you about the co-conspirator statements. And the best way to talk to you about that is to read the law to you, as you will hear again at the end of the case. Evidence of a statement made by one alleged conspirator other than at this trial shall not be considered by you as against another alleged conspirator unless you determine, by a preponderance of the evidence; one, that from other independent evidence that at the time the statement was made, a conspiracy to commit a crime existed. Two, that the statement was made while the person making the statement was participating in the conspiracy, and that the person against whom it was offered was participating in the conspiracy before and during that time. And three, that the statement was made in furtherance of the objective of the conspiracy. The word "statement" as used in this instruction includes any oral or written, verbal expression or nonverbal conduct that a person -- intended by that person as a substitute for an oral, written, verbal expression. So what is going to happen in this trial is that certain statements are going to come in. And you will later not be able to consider those statements unless you determine, in accordance with this instruction, that there was a conspiracy and that those statements were in the furtherance of an objective of the conspiracy. But the law allows the parties to present statements before and after they think the conspiracy is proved or disproved. So it would be very difficult to handle the case in another way. So you're going to hear statements and later determine your use, as a jury, of those statements in accordance with the law. So I'm going to conditionally admit some statements this morning and the condition is that you will later determine how you're going to use those statements. Along those same lines, during the course of the trial, the attorneys make objections. I rule on those objections, and I'm following rules of evidence. Quite often it's not necessary that you know why I make a ruling. If I sustain an objection, you just -- you reject the question. You don't consider the answer, if part of it came in or all of it. If I overrule an objection, that doesn't mean that I'm favoring that evidence. All I'm saying is that side has the right to give you that evidence for you to consider, and it has nothing to do with my feelings about it. Okay? In that regard, yesterday, the witness, who just stepped down, her name --
Mr. Sneddon: Miss Gabriel.
Mr. Auchincloss: Gabriel Kite.
The Court: Ms. Kite, Miss Gabriel, said -- the question was asked, "And did you go to work for Michael Jackson?" And the answer was, "Yes, I did." Earlier, the question had been asked, "At some time did Mr. LeGrand ask to employ you and come to work for Michael Jackson?" And there was an objection as hearsay. Well, I overruled that objection, and the reason I did is that the -- at that point in the proceeding, it is my opinion that wasn't offered for the truth of the matter; i.e., that she worked for Michael Jackson. It was offered only to show you why she came to work and what she thought she was doing. So it wasn't the truth of the matter, that she worked for Mr. Jackson. That, in fact, you will have to determine whether or not she did. I don't know the answer to that. That will be your decision. But each side will present evidence on that. So as to yesterday, the question, "At some time did Mr. LeGrand ask to employ you to come to work for Michael Jackson?" She said, "Yes, he did." The instruction I'm giving you is that's to be considered only -- at this point only to show what she thought she was doing. Not for the truth of the matter that she was working for Michael Jackson. Okay? Very complicated. But I'll continue to instruct you, as needed, to help you with this. Very difficult area of dealing with statements and conspiracies. Okay? You may resume the witness stand.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you, Your Honor.
The Court: When you take the witness stand, I'll remind you that you are still under oath.
Message: ANN MARIE KITE Having been previously sworn, resumed the stand and testified further as follows:
Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION Continued BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:
Mr. Auchincloss: Good morning, Ms. Kite.
Ann Kite: Good morning.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yesterday, when we left off, we were talking a little bit about your history, the chronology of events in your employment. And let me revisit the question of who you believed you were working for. First of all, who was it that actually hired you for this work that you did for Michael Jackson?
Ann Kite: Who asked me to come to work for Michael Jackson?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Ann Kite: David LeGrand.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And when did you -- was there a period of time in which you discussed with Mr. LeGrand working for Michael Jackson?
Ann Kite: Yes --
Mr. Auchincloss: Prior to your employment, actual employment?
Ann Kite: Yes, there was.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when was that -- when did that discussion begin?
Ann Kite: About the 27th of January.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Were there further discussions -- when were you actually hired?
Ann Kite: On the 9th of February, Mr. LeGrand sent me an e-mail along with other people that were working on the MJJ working group that said, "Welcome to the team."
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And between that period of time when you began discussions with Mr. LeGrand and the time that you actually became a member of the team, did you continue to have discussions with Mr. LeGrand about the issues involved in being a PR person for Michael Jackson?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you paid for your employment?
Ann Kite: Yes, I was.
Mr. Auchincloss: How much?
Ann Kite: $10,000.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was that payment in advance or arrears of your employment?
Ann Kite: Well, it was supposed to be $20,000 for the month. When I signed the contract on the 14th of February, David gave me a $10,000 check, so that was an advance.
Mr. Auchincloss: So you began your work on the 9th?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: You signed your contract on the 14th?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What time did you sign that contract?
Ann Kite: Late in the afternoon. It was between three and four o'clock.
Mr. Auchincloss: And where did that take place, the signing?
Ann Kite: At Mr. LeGrand's law office.
Mr. Auchincloss: And where is that?
Ann Kite: In Las Vegas.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. As far as your background as a public relations person, what do you consider to be your greatest assets in that field?
Ann Kite: I believe it's crisis management. Being able to see a problem, and determine what needs -- steps can be taken to correct it.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are there any contacts or other qualities that you possess that enable you to conduct that type of work?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, I can be a little more specific.
Mr. Auchincloss: What is it that enables you to conduct crisis management in terms of any abilities, any -- well, let me just leave it open. Let me leave it open-ended. What do you do -- how do you go about conducting crisis management work?
Ann Kite: Well, other than being neurotic, which comes in very handy, I think I have a very good grasp of the media as a whole. Internet, television, radio, newspaper. And an innate ability to be able to size up the client or the product that I'm representing, find out where their assets are, the best aspects that they have to represent themselves to the public, or the product, and to be able to move them forward from there. But regardless of if it's a crisis management client or if it's just a client that you're trying to do public relations for, I think probably my greatest asset is being able to see the total product or the total person, and to explore other avenues of being able to bring them to fruition.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you have a philosophy about how to approach crisis management?
Ann Kite: Absolutely.
Mr. Auchincloss: What is that?
Ann Kite: Very proactive.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what do you mean by "proactive"?
Ann Kite: Being out in front of the media, having a crisis plan just in case something happens. A lot of times when people begin to promote themselves or to promote a product, they like to think of the good -- the upside, the good things that can come out of promoting themselves or their product, and they don't like to analyze the bad things that might happen. I have an ability to be able to do both before I start with the client, so that they can be comfortable and not panic if something happens. I want them to know that I've been able to thoroughly research both the ups and downs of everything they do and that, you know, I can cover them on either side.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is it important to confront the bad things?
Ann Kite: Absolutely.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why do you believe that?
Ann Kite: Because if you don't confront it, somebody else is going to confront it for you, and then you're going to be caught in a downward spiral.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. When you were first in discussions with Mr. LeGrand in late January, what did you perceive to be Michael Jackson's status issues, what have you, regarding public relations?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you began discussions with Mr. LeGrand concerning working with Michael Jackson or working on his behalf, did you do some research into news media, Mr. Jackson's background, anything of that nature, to better understand the public relations issues involving Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And based on that research, were you able to form an opinion as to what PR issues needed to be addressed or should be addressed if you were called to become an employee?
Ann Kite: Yes, I was.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: Your Honor, she is testifying in some capacity as an expert witness in this area.
The Court: The objection is overruled.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Ann Kite: Yes, I was.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. How did you evaluate Mr. Jackson from a PR point of view at that point, late in January?
Ann Kite: What was my evaluation and recommendation, is that the question?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Ann Kite: I believed that there was too much negative exposure on Mr. Jackson's actions, and not enough exposure on his strength as a musician. And so I told Mr. LeGrand that I felt immediately the focus needed to be taken off of him as a person, as a man, and the things that the public may or may not like about him, and put back on all of the years of wonderful music that he had given to the public.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And sometime between the time when you were recruited and the time that you actually became an employee, did something occur that changed your perspective as to what the necessary issues were dealing with PR?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection, Your Honor. May I 402 the witness on her credentials, the basis for her opinion?
The Court: No. Go ahead.
Ann Kite: Can you repeat the question?
Mr. Auchincloss: The question was, between late January and the time that you were actually hired, I believe you said it was the 9th of February, did something happen that changed your perception of Mr. Jackson from a public relations standpoint?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was that?
Ann Kite: The Martin Bashir documentary.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. What -- how did that -- the Martin Bashir documentary present itself as an issue for you, from a public relations standpoint?
Ann Kite: As an absolute disaster.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why do you say that?
Ann Kite: I felt that the documentary was put together in a way that portrayed Mr. Jackson in an extremely negative light.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were there particular issues with that documentary that you believed presented problems for Mr. Jackson from a PR point of view?
Ann Kite: Yes, there were.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; relevance; 352.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Auchincloss: What were those issues?
Ann Kite: I believed that Mr. Jackson was portrayed in a very negative light in his actions as far as the shopping spree, as far as climbing the tree, as far as statements made portraying himself as Peter Pan, and the interaction that he had with the person that was on the video.
Mr. Auchincloss: The young boy?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And how did -- did you monitor the international media during this period of time?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is that part of your job?
Ann Kite: Yes, it is.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what was the reaction of the international media at this point?
Ann Kite: Well, there was an immediate reaction, and they jumped on exactly what I believed that they would, which was to --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; nonresponsive.
The Court: The question was, "What was the reaction." And I'll sustain the objection.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. I'll reask the question.
Mr. Auchincloss: In terms of the reaction of the international media, how did you evaluate in your role as a public relations person?
Ann Kite: That it was extremely negative.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Was there any positive media?
Ann Kite: Not to my knowledge.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. You have -- have you ever been asked to characterize or measure this crisis on a scale of 1 to 10?
Ann Kite: Yes, I have.
Mr. Auchincloss: And how did you characterize it?
Ann Kite: A 25 --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: A 25.
Mr. Auchincloss: So you perceived this to be a big problem?
Ann Kite: Absolutely.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you formulate a plan to deal with this problem?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you work with other people in formulating this plan?
Ann Kite: Somewhat, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Were they other members of the team?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Specifically, who?
Ann Kite: Specifically Melanie Riley from Bell Yard.
Mr. Auchincloss: And tell me a little bit more about Bell Yard, if you would.
Ann Kite: Bell Yard is a crisis management public relations firm in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are they a small firm, large firm, medium?
Ann Kite: I don't know.
Mr. Auchincloss: And was there just Melanie that you dealt with from Bell Yard, or other people as well?
Ann Kite: I believe Richard was the other gentleman that I dealt with from Bell Yard.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know their last names?
Ann Kite: Melanie is Riley. And I don't remember Richard's last name.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So in the beginning, when you were formulating this plan, what was your -- what was your idea, what was your goal?
Ann Kite: Well, my goal was to immediately speak with someone and assess all of the negative impacts from the Bashir documentary, addressing each one. Because my fear was that while one media source might pick up on one thing, another media source would pick up on another thing, so there would be multiple angles coming at us. And I felt and believed that unless we had a clear plan of attack to be able to address each one of these issues, we were not going to be as proactive on Mr. Jackson's behalf as we needed to be.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were there any other goals other than attacking the current media problem?
Ann Kite: Yes. My goal was to begin an immediate rehabilitation on his image.
Mr. Auchincloss: So how did you plan to go about these goals?
Ann Kite: Well, I needed to address, first of all, the negative items that were coming out in the press. And then once that was taken care of, I wanted to begin to do the rehabilitation on his image.
Mr. Auchincloss: So in terms of the nuts and bolts of public relations, how do you go about doing that?
Ann Kite: How would I personally go about doing that?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Ann Kite: I would write out a list of questions, decide how people wanted to respond or to react. I would look at what was potentially coming up in the media. Because you have to understand, with the media, they don't call you up politely and say, "We're going to write a story about your client, and we'd love to give you an opportunity to respond and please tell us your side." They send you a very short e-mail or give you a call and say, "Look, this is what we're printing about your client, and I'm on a deadline, so if you don't get back to me, too bad." I mean, that's pretty much what it was. And so I believed that we needed to immediately sit down and assess all of the negative things that could have come out of this documentary for Mr. Jackson, and decide how we wanted to respond so that we didn't get stuck in a downward spiral of people printing things because they didn't get a response quickly enough.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Martin Bashir figure in in any way to your plan of attack?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: In what way?
Ann Kite: I wanted to look at the credibility of the other documentaries that he had done.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Bell Yard in agreement with that?
Ann Kite: Yes, they were.
Mr. Auchincloss: Generally speaking, was Bell Yard's approach to the problem of Mr. Jackson's PR consistent with your own?
Ann Kite: Yes, it was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you participate in conference calls with Bell Yard with any of the members of the team?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Which members?
Ann Kite: I believe one or two times Mr. Geragos and Mr. Konitzer were on the calls. The other times it was mostly the team from the UK; Andrew Hochhauser, Hamish Porter, Peter and Janie Castle.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Ann Kite: John Genga, too, also was on those phone calls. And then David LeGrand.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was Mr. Castle's and Genga's duties? Who were they?
Ann Kite: They were other attorneys. I don't know specifically what their duties were, other than I believe they were involved in the litigation that was -- that Mr. Jackson had undertaken against Granada and ITV.
Mr. Auchincloss: So I believe yesterday you testified that one of the people you reported to was Marc Schaffel?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you also report to Ronald Konitzer?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what about Mark Geragos?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: When did Mark Geragos become part of the team?
Ann Kite: I believe it was around the 7th of February.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. During the time -- or the month of February, early February, did the problem of Mr. Jackson's PR become exacerbated in any fashion?
Ann Kite: Yes, it did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Specifically why?
Ann Kite: Besides the documentary?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Ann Kite: There was some information released about Mr. Jackson in the public that I felt also negatively impacted his image.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. What? What was it?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. 352; foundation; and hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: This is also offered to explain her conduct as well as the conduct of the team and the level of the crisis.
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, I would object. She's not qualified as an expert.
Mr. Auchincloss: She's not offering an opinion at this point.
The Court: I'm not considering her testimony as expert testimony. She's a percipient witness as to what happened during this time period, and that's the only way that I'm considering her testimony. That's why I denied your 402 request, because she's just a percipient witness. So -- and on your 352 objection, was that over a time -- I'm not sure -- which of the many specific areas were you objecting under 352?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, Your Honor, she worked for less than two --
The Court: No, which of the legal subsections of 352 are you relying on --
Mr. Mesereau: All of them.
The Court: -- for your objection?
Mr. Mesereau: All of them.
The Court: All right. Overruled.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: So I'll back up a little bit. You've said that there were additional problems that arose in the media. Did you have to perceive it as your duties to deal with these problems as a PR representative for Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: So these problems became your problems?
Ann Kite: Absolutely. I felt it was my position to address anything that affected Mr. Jackson negatively.
Mr. Auchincloss: So what was coming out in the media at this point?
Ann Kite: There were documents that were released on a website, thesmokinggun.com, that, in conjunction with the Bashir documentary, I felt was just absolutely beyond a disaster for Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And what did those documents concern?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay; foundation; 352.
Mr. Auchincloss: As reported in the media, is the question.
Mr. Mesereau: Same objection, Your Honor.
The Court: I'll overrule the objection, but advise the jury, again, that this area is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted; that whatever she's going to testify to that appeared on The Smoking Gun is being offered strictly to show why she took her next action.
Mr. Auchincloss: And I'm not asking you specifically what was written in those documents. I'm just asking in general terms, what was that document about?
Ann Kite: It addressed another PR issue that Mr. Jackson had in 1993.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was that PR issue?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection.
Mr. Auchincloss: That's my question.
Mr. Mesereau: 352; foundation; hearsay; no personal knowledge.
Mr. Auchincloss: I believe she has personal knowledge --
The Court: I've already ruled on this. The objection is overruled. Go ahead.
Mr. Auchincloss: You may answer the question.
Ann Kite: They involved Mr. Jackson having inappropriate actions with a young boy.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. The '93 case?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. What else was there? What other problems, other than the '93 case, did you -- that came up? You said there were several.
Ann Kite: Besides the documentary, the things that were contained in the documentary?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes, uh-huh.
Ann Kite: Well, the media then began to pick up on any number of things about Mr. Jackson. Pediatricians were weighing in about the way that he fed his baby on the documentary. There was just several -- they were attacking him personally from every angle.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Were there any other news -- purported news programs that were coming?
Ann Kite: Yes, there were.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was that?
Ann Kite: NBC was doing a program about Mr. Jackson's purported plastic surgeries.
Mr. Auchincloss: Just that, or did that include other things?
Ann Kite: Also included other things.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Was that actually aired?
Ann Kite: Yes, it was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was that positive or negative for Mr. Jackson, in general terms?
Ann Kite: In general, I felt it was very negative.
Mr. Auchincloss: What about members of the team specifically? Were there ever any members of the team that became problems or burdens in terms of the media and Mr. Jackson's image?
Ann Kite: Yes, there was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who?
Ann Kite: Mr. Schaffel.
Mr. Auchincloss: Marc Schaffel?
Ann Kite: Marc Schaffel, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And why was he a problem?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. 352; foundation; hearsay.
The Court: Vague; sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was it specifically that was reported in the media? And I'm just asking you -- well, let me just say generally, why was Mr. Schaffel a problem in the media concerning Mr. Jackson?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; hearsay; vague; 352.
The Court: The objection's overruled.
Ann Kite: Mr. Schaffel had a very negative image and I felt very strongly that that image might taint Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Who else had a problem?
Ann Kite: With Mr. Schaffel?
Mr. Auchincloss: No. Was there any other member of the team that presented a problem for Mr. Jackson, I should say?
Ann Kite: Not of the team per se. But there were -- there was someone else that Mr. Jackson's name was associated in the press that I felt would be a problem.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Who else was that?
Ann Kite: Mr. Malnik. Al Malnik.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. You say you were hired by Mr. Jackson. Have you ever met Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I have not.
Mr. Auchincloss: And why did you believe that you were working for him?
Ann Kite: Because David LeGrand told me that I was. And the contract that I signed said "MJJ Productions" on it.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. And did you, in fact, work on Mr. Jackson's behalf?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, absolutely.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Who did you understand was paying your $10,000 retainer?
Ann Kite: Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: What proactive measures, if any, did you want to take to address these issues?
Ann Kite: Well, I believed that immediately there should be a very strong on-camera statement from Mr. Jackson himself. I wanted to be able to explore the documentary that Mr. Bashir had created to see if there were any technical inconsistencies. I wanted to be able to use everything at my disposal to try to find a way to address the issues that Mr. Jackson was experiencing and give the other side of the story.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you ever heard of the organization called "Fire Mountain"?
Ann Kite: Yes, I have.
Mr. Auchincloss: What is Fire Mountain?
Ann Kite: Fire Mountain is a corporation --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there a film that was being prepared to help address the PR issues?
Ann Kite: Yes, there was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Whose idea was that?
Ann Kite: I don't know the answer to that --
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Ann Kite: -- specifically.
Mr. Auchincloss: But it wasn't your idea?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there a member of the team that was preparing this film?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who was that?
Ann Kite: Mr. Schaffel.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know what the subject matter of this film was?
Ann Kite: It was to be a rebuttal to Martin Bashir's documentary.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have any discussions with the team concerning what network or what broadcast medium would be used to show this film?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know whether it was ultimately aired?
Ann Kite: Yes, it was.
Mr. Auchincloss: On which network?
Ann Kite: FOX.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know why FOX was chosen?
Ann Kite: Yes, I do.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why is that?
Ann Kite: Because they would give Mr. Schaffel an element of creative control.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were there any other networks that were bidding for it?
Ann Kite: Yes, there was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who?
Ann Kite: NBC.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have any input into whether or not certain people would be included on this rebuttal film?
Ann Kite: I had a discussion with Mr. Schaffel about the rebuttal film, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you provide him some -- your insights as to what should be presented?
Ann Kite: He told me some things that he thought -- some people that he thought he was going to put on the film and asked me what I thought. And I told him --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: This is offered to explain conduct and -- actually, I can -- I can move on and get more to the point. So I'll withdraw the question and allow the striking of the answer.
The Court: I'll strike the answer. But she never got to say anything about what was said.
Mr. Auchincloss: Very well.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have -- did you have a discussion about Mr. Jackson's ex-wives with Mr. Schaffel?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have a suggestion for him about whether one of these -- one or both of these ex-wives should be presented on the rebuttal film?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. 352; foundation.
The Court: The question calls for hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: The question -- Your Honor, I haven't asked for a statement. I've just asked whether she had a discussion.
The Court: All right. I'll overrule the objection.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have a discussion with Mr. Schaffel about that?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you make a suggestion?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you suggest?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. 352; foundation.
The Court: Calls for hearsay.
Mr. Mesereau: Hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. Schaffel ever make any comments to you concerning his influence over Debbie Rowe?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; foundation; hearsay; 352.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll be happy to give you an offer of proof, Your Honor.
The Court: The leading is sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Ms. Kite -- (Laughter.)
The Court: Go ahead.
Bailiff Cortez: Try it again?
The Court: Yes.
Bailiff Cortez: It's back on, Judge.
The Court: All right. Go ahead.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have a discussion with Mr. Schaffel about proposed -- any proposed individuals that would appear on the rebuttal film?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; foundation; hearsay; 352.
Mr. Auchincloss: Hardly leading.
The Court: Objection is overruled.
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Who did you discuss?
Ann Kite: Debbie Rowe.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And did you have a feeling about whether or not, from a PR standpoint, she would be a good candidate for this rebuttal film?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay; foundation; 352; leading.
Mr. Auchincloss: The question is, did she have a feeling.
Mr. Mesereau: Relevance; and vague.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Ann Kite: I'm sorry, you're going to have to ask again after all that.
The Court: I'll have the question read back.
The Court Reporter: Okay. And did you have a feeling about whether or not, from a PR standpoint, she would be a good candidate for this rebuttal film?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was that?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. 352; relevance; foundation; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: I'm sorry.
The Court: I can have it read back.
Ann Kite: Please.
The Court Reporter: What was that?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what was that feeling?
Ann Kite: I didn't think she was the strongest candidate.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what was Mr. Schaffel's response?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay; 352.
Mr. Auchincloss: This is offered in furtherance of the conspiracy.
Mr. Mesereau: Foundation.
The Court: All right. I'm taking the -- this testimony subject to the proving up of the conspiracy. I'll allow the question.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did Mr. Schaffel tell you?
Ann Kite: He said that he could get Debbie Rowe to say whatever he wanted her to say.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you. This notebook is coming apart, Your Honor. If I can have just a moment. During the course of your work with the team, I believe you testified that you used the Internet to communicate through e-mails?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: I previously provided counsel with copies of all these documents, Your Honor, that I'm going to be showing the witness. And for the record, this is document number -- from original exhibits, Schaffel files, and appears to be a document itemized under 403, page 17. It appears to be a three-page e-mail from Ronald at High Tech America to Marc in L.A. dated 2-16-03.
The Court: Is it marked?
Mr. Mesereau: May we see that for a second, please? Thank you.
Mr. Auchincloss: I provided you with copies. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
The Court: Now, this is a formally marked exhibit?
Mr. Auchincloss: It is, Your Honor.
The Court: 403 is the exhibit number?
Mr. Auchincloss: It is the exhibit number. and it is beginning on page 17 of Exhibit No. 403.
Mr. Auchincloss: If you could take a moment and just look at page four -- or Exhibit No. 403, what I've identified, pages 17, 18, and 19.
Mr. Sanger: Could we just have a moment?
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me. We don't have the second page of that exhibit. Maybe we could --
Mr. Auchincloss: It's in the packet I gave you.
Mr. Mesereau: It's in the back?
Mr. Auchincloss: It's in the packet I gave you yesterday. Do you have that?
Mr. Mesereau: It's not in the binder. Is it somewhere else?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: It appears to say page one of two, but there's no page two.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is it in --
Ms. Yu: The individual packet?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yeah, it's in there. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you had a moment to look at that?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Can you identify that for me?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm not blaming anybody. We don't seem to have page two of the exhibit.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm sorry. I'll take a moment and show counsel. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Have you had a chance to look at that?
Ann Kite: Yes, I have.
Mr. Auchincloss: Can you identify it for me?
Ann Kite: Yes, it's an e-mail that I sent to Ronald Konitzer with --
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. What was the date of the e-mail that you sent to Ronald Konitzer?
Ann Kite: It was the 14th of February.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what was -- I'm not going to ask you to read it to the jury at this time. We're going to lay some additional foundation with this exhibit at a later time. But I'm going to ask you to tell me what was the substance of that e-mail, and what was your purpose in sending it. And let's start with, what was -- what was the concern you expressed in that e-mail?
Ann Kite: I expressed great concern that there were many things that were preparing to break negatively against Mr. Jackson over the next 72 hours, which would have been between the 14th of February and the 17th. And I just did not understand why there wasn't anyone --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Narrative and nonresponsive.
The Court: Sustained as to the last sentence is stricken.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: So I was asking you what your concerns were. What concerns specifically did you express in that e-mail?
Ann Kite: That --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Your Honor, this is offered to show knowledge on behalf of the co-conspirators, the reasons for the part of the motive of this case, the nature of the crisis, and the action that were taken on behalf of this witness to alert --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. That is a speaking objection, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: Goes to the objection.
The Court: Are you offering this -- are you offering this to explain a response from the recipient of this e-mail?
Mr. Auchincloss: I am offering it, Your Honor, to explain -- it's offered to explain the conduct as well as the information that was conveyed by this witness to the co-conspirators regarding the degree of the crisis that existed at that time. Now, it is not being offered into evidence at this time, but I'm laying foundation for its offering that will provide additional foundation at a later date.
Mr. Mesereau: May I object, Your Honor?
Mr. Auchincloss: Her purposes in sending this e-mail and the fact that she did send it to Mr. Konitzer and provided him with this information is relevant as to Mr. Konitzer's knowledge of the events.
Mr. Mesereau: I object on hearsay and foundation. And there's no evidence whatsoever Mr. Jackson's involved in any conspiracy.
Mr. Auchincloss: That remains to be seen.
The Court: Any of the conspiracy evidence is being received subject to the proving up of the conspiracy, as I've indicated. The Court will allow the question here with the admonition that the information that is being conveyed in the e-mail is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but to show that the recipient received this information. Or not that he received it; that it was sent to him.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Auchincloss: So, back to my question. I'll rephrase it. Why don't we -- what was your purpose in sending this e-mail? Why don't I ask it that way.
Ann Kite: To advise Mr. Konitzer that over the next 72 hours Mr. Jackson was going to face another barrage of extremely negative publicity, and it needed to be addressed immediately.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were the --
The Court: All right. Let's take our morning break.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you, Your Honor. Madam Reporter, could I have a read-back on the last question? I think we left on a question.
The Court Reporter: Were the --
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Thank you.
Mr. Auchincloss: Showing you at this time Exhibit No. 405, page one. It appears to be a statement from Bell Yard regarding Janet Arvizo, dated February 8th, 2003. Ms. Kite, did you prepare that statement?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have anything to do with the preparation of that statement?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are you familiar with that type of statement in the capacity of being a PR --
Ann Kite: Yes, I am.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- person? What does it mean when a statement is embargoed?
Ann Kite: It means that the statement is prepared and sent out to the news wires, but that the media isn't allowed to release the statement until the time that's stated on the press release. That's what embargoed means. It means we'll send you the information, but you need to hold it until the time we've specified before you can put it out.
Mr. Auchincloss: So this statement would be -- it would not be allowed to be printed in the media until what time, according --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: Assuming this statement is a statement for -- that is embargoed until February 8th, midnight.
Ann Kite: 22 --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading and no foundation. She's not familiar with the document, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: These are expert questions, Your Honor.
The Court: I haven't been accepting her testimony at this point as an expert.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, I do think she had familiarity sufficient to talk about the nature of embargoed documents when they are released to the media.
The Court: And she has. But the question now you asked was specifically as to this document.
Mr. Auchincloss: I can talk hypothetically, if you'd like.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Hypothetically speaking, if a document was embargoed for a date, let's say January 1st, at twelve noon, what does that mean in terms of its production in the media?
Ann Kite: Well --
Mr. Mesereau: I'm going to object, Your Honor. She's not qualified as an expert.
Mr. Auchincloss: This is an area where she has knowledge, Your Honor. It's beyond the -- it's beyond the scope of a layperson's understanding in these areas.
The Court: The objection is overruled. You may answer.
Ann Kite: What it means is that the person producing the document puts the information together, and sends it out to the media. The media has it in their hands, but they cannot release it for public consumption until the time that's stated on the document.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Moving on to Exhibit No. 410, page one. It appears to be a list of phone numbers. First name is Mark Geragos, Criminal Lawyer, in the upper left-hand side. Is your name on that list of phone numbers?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, it is.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are there any other members of the team on that list of phone numbers?
Ann Kite: Yes, there are.
Mr. Auchincloss: Which ones?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; hearsay.
The Court: The foundation is sustained. And what I'm thinking of -- I'm not sure what Mr. Mesereau was thinking of, but what I'm thinking of is "the team" is vague.
Mr. Auchincloss: As to members of the team.
The Court: You said that, yes. That was your question. And I don't know what you're referring to.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: You mentioned that there was a number of people that were on a PR team; is that correct?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: To deal with the issues, the PR problem that you previously identified, regarding Michael Jackson?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are there any other members of that PR team that are on that phone sheet that is before you?
Ann Kite: Yes, there are.
Mr. Auchincloss: Which ones?
Ann Kite: Mark Geragos, Ronald Konitzer, Richard Elsen, Stuart Backerman, David LeGrand, and myself. And these are the people that I dealt with directly.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is there a phone number associated with your name?
Ann Kite: Yes, there is.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is it correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, it is.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are there any other names on that list that were the subject of the PR issues that you were addressing?
Ann Kite: Yes, there is.
Mr. Auchincloss: What names?
Ann Kite: Gavin Arvizo.
Mr. Auchincloss: Any others?
Ann Kite: Yes. Debbie Rowe.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Is that it?
Ann Kite: Yes, as far as I can tell.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Thank you. Finally, I'll show you what appears to be a release form, Exhibit No. 412, page number two. Have you ever seen that document?
Ann Kite: Yes, I have.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you prepare that -- a portion of that document?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there a portion of that document that was not prepared by you?
Ann Kite: Yes, there was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where did you get that document from, that portion that you're describing?
Ann Kite: David LeGrand.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. First of all, describe for me what they have here as that exhibit.
Ann Kite: This is an appearance, consent and release form.
Mr. Auchincloss: And it came to you from David LeGrand?
Ann Kite: Yes, it did.
Mr. Auchincloss: On what date; do you know?
Ann Kite: I believe it was around the 10th of February.
Mr. Auchincloss: And were you instructed to do something with this document?
Ann Kite: Yes, I was.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was that?
Ann Kite: I was instructed to take out the words "MJJ Productions Inc." and put in "Gabriel Media, Inc."
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you do that?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you do with the document then?
Ann Kite: I sent it back to Mr. LeGrand.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know what the purpose of that action was?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: It's a yes or no question.
Mr. Mesereau: Foundation for elements.
The Court: Foundation; sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. During your work for Mr. Jackson, at some point, did you become aware of a problem involving the Arvizo family?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: How did you become aware of that problem?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay; foundation; 352.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered in furtherance of the conspiracy.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: Mr. Schaffel called me.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you remember the approximate date or the date that that call took place?
Ann Kite: Yes, it was the 13th of February.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did Mr. Schaffel tell you?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered in furtherance of the conspiracy.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: He told me that Janet had taken the kids and left the ranch either late at night or early in the morning.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you express any concern to him?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Mr. Auchincloss: At that time?
The Court: You may answer.
Ann Kite: Well, I didn't understand what it was that he was trying to say to me. I mean, I knew what he said, but I wasn't understanding where he was going with it.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Mr. Schaffel -- what was his demeanor when he was telling you this?
Ann Kite: He was extremely agitated.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you understand what was the source of his agitation?
Ann Kite: Yes. That Janet had taken the kids and left the ranch.
Mr. Auchincloss: Sometime later, did you receive another phone call or have another phone conversation with Mr. Schaffel concerning this subject?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: When was that?
Ann Kite: It was later that day.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what was said?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered in furtherance of the conspiracy.
The Court: All right. The objection's overruled.
Ann Kite: He said that the situation had been contained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did that concern you?
Ann Kite: Yes, it did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Why?
Ann Kite: Because I believed that if somebody had taken their children and left the ranch, there must be some type of problem. And the way that he answered me by saying the situation was contained made me very uncomfortable.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ask him any other questions about that?
Ann Kite: No, I did not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have any further conversations with Mr. Schaffel about this subject?
Ann Kite: During the -- one of the two conversations, and I believe it was the last one when he said the situation had been contained, he told me that he --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; nonresponsive.
Mr. Auchincloss: You can answer the question yes or no, first of all.
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what was said in that conversation?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered in furtherance of the conspiracy
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: That he was going to fax me a letter; that he wanted me to put it away for safekeeping.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ask him any further questions about that?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he ever say anything to you about the ranch, about the family?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered to refresh recollection.
The Court: The objection is sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he make any further statements to you about the Arvizo family?
Ann Kite: Yes, he said that they had been brought back to the ranch.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did this conversation concern you?
Ann Kite: Yes, it did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why?
Ann Kite: Because I didn't understand why he would be so upset about them leaving the ranch and then telling me the situation had been contained and that they had been brought back to the rather all within a span of approximately 12 hours or so.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have any conversations with other members of the team regarding this issue?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who else?
Ann Kite: David LeGrand.
Mr. Auchincloss: When did that conversation take place?
Ann Kite: It was later that same day, on the 13th.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you call him or did he call you?
Ann Kite: I called him.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did you ask him?
Ann Kite: I said, "Did I hear right, what Marc Schaffel said to me; that Janet left the ranch?" And I said, "Don't make me believe --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; nonresponsive.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: I said, "Don't make me believe that these people were hunted down like dogs and brought back to the ranch."
The Court: Okay. I'm going to strike that answer in response to the nonresponsive objection. The jury's to disregard the answer.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: When did you tell Mr. LeGrand -- well, let me rephrase that. Did you tell Mr. LeGrand -- express to Mr. LeGrand your concern about the Arvizos?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you say?
The Court: Just a moment. Overruled.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you say? How did you express your concern to Mr. LeGrand?
Ann Kite: What words did I use?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: It's hearsay, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: The response is what is being offered. The responses to the question is being offered in advance of the conspiracy.
The Court: All right. I'll allow the answer. Do you need the question read back?
Ann Kite: Yes, Your Honor. I don't understand the --
The Court: All right. She doesn't understand. You need to rephrase your question. We won't read it back.
Mr. Auchincloss: I need you to answer this question one more time for me. What did you say to Mr. LeGrand concerning -- well, you previously said that Mr. LeGrand -- well, no. Let me strike that. What did you say to Mr. LeGrand expressing your concern about the Arvizos, specifically? What did you say?
Ann Kite: Do you want my verbatim?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Hearsay and foundation.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: I said, "Don't make me believe that these people were hunted down like dogs and brought back to the ranch."
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. LeGrand answer your question directly?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did he say?
Ann Kite: He said, "I can't discuss this right now."
Mr. Auchincloss: Then what happened?
Ann Kite: Um, we continued to discuss what happened on the morning conference call with Bell Yard, and hung up.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever express your concern or ask any questions about this subject to any other members of the team?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who was that?
Ann Kite: Ronald Konitzer.
Mr. Auchincloss: How did you express your concern to Ronald Konitzer? Let me back up. First of all, when did this conversation take place?
Ann Kite: It was later in the day of the 13th.
Mr. Auchincloss: And how did you express your concern to Mr. Konitzer?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: Same purpose, Your Honor.
The Court: To explain the response that's --
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
The Court: -- that's in the furtherance of a conspiracy?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
The Court: All right. I'll overrule the objection.
Ann Kite: I asked him about Marc Schaffel's comment about the situation being contained.
Mr. Auchincloss: And do you recall specifically what you asked him?
Ann Kite: Yes. I said, "What was" -- "What was the situation with Janet and Gavin leaving the ranch?"
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did he tell you?
Ann Kite: He told me that --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered in furtherance of the conspiracy.
The Court: The objection's overruled
Ann Kite: He told me that the situation had been taken care of.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he offer any other explanation?
Ann Kite: No, sir, he did not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did anyone ever provide you with any further explanation of the Arvizo issue?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did this cause you concern?
Ann Kite: Yes, it did.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll rephrase.
The Court: I'll sustain the objection.
Mr. Auchincloss: How did you feel about that?
Ann Kite: Very concerned.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So during your tenure working with the team, how did you feel, or did you agree with how the team was conducting itself in terms of the PR --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- addressing the PR issues that you were hired to address?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Compound. Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you agree with the team, how the team was handling the PR problem?
Ann Kite: No, I did not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why not?
Ann Kite: Because I believed that they were leaving Mr. Jackson exposed in a way that was extremely negative for him.
Mr. Auchincloss: How were they leaving him exposed?
Ann Kite: By not addressing the issues that were being raised by the press.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were they being proactive?
Ann Kite: No, not at all.
Mr. Auchincloss: When were you terminated as a PR representative?
Ann Kite: On the 15th of February.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you given an explanation as to why you were terminated?
Ann Kite: I received an e-mail, if that's your question.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did they explain why -- the reason for your termination?
Ann Kite: No. There was no explanation. I can tell you what the e-mail said.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did the e-mail say?
Ann Kite: The e-mail said Ronald --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. I'll go back to the question. Did the e-mail explain -- it didn't explain the reason for your termination?
Ann Kite: No, sir. It didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: It's not a statement.
The Court: It's not a statement. It's an unstatement. Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you -- were you ever provided, by anybody, with an explanation --
Ann Kite: No, sir, I was not.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- as to why you were terminated?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss: At some point did you prepare to make a statement, while you were still employed, on television?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was the television show?
Ann Kite: Access Hollywood.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when was that?
Ann Kite: When was it scheduled?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Ann Kite: For the 14th of February.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you ever told to clear such appearances before any member of the team?
Ann Kite: Not when the preparations for Access Hollywood were being made, no.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you clear your appearance on Access Hollywood with any member of the team?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who?
Ann Kite: I spoke with Mr. Schaffel, I spoke with Mr. Geragos and I spoke with Mr. Konitzer.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you tell them what you were going to say?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did they agree with you to go ahead?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you go to Access Hollywood and prepare to make that statement?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: I take it this was a pro Jackson statement on Mr. Jackson's behalf?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did something unusual happen while you were on the set?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was that?
Ann Kite: I was pulled off the set by Mr. Geragos.
Mr. Auchincloss: In what fashion?
Ann Kite: He called Access Hollywood and told them to not do the interview with me.
Mr. Auchincloss: How much time before the expected filming of the set were you pulled off?
Ann Kite: I was actually miked and sitting on the set with Pat O'Brien.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did that cause you some concern?
Ann Kite: Yes, it did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why?
Ann Kite: Because I was of the belief that Mr. Jackson had been barraged by so much negative publicity, and I wanted to be able to get back into a proactive cycle for him.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. Geragos's involvement in this action cause you any concern?
Ann Kite: Yes, it did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why?
Ann Kite: Because he was a criminal attorney.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why would that cause you concern?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Relevance; hearsay
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you subsequently have a conversation with Mr. Geragos about your employment --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- for Mr. Jackson?
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Ann Kite: I'm sorry, I don't understand your question.
Mr. Auchincloss: After you were pulled off the set of Access Hollywood, did you subsequently have any conversations with Mr. Geragos about your employment with Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: I had a conversation with Mr. Geragos, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: When did that take place?
Ann Kite: On the set of Access Hollywood.
Mr. Auchincloss: So you spoke to him then?
Ann Kite: Yes, on the phone.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. And what was that conversation about?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered in furtherance of a conspiracy.
The Court: I'll sustain the objection, because it's vague, "What was the conversation about?" It calls for a conclusion of the witness.
Mr. Auchincloss: I can be more specific. Did Mr. Geragos make any request of you?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was the request?
Ann Kite: He --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered in furtherance of the conspiracy.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: He asked me to stay in town overnight and come into his office the next morning and meet with him.
Mr. Auchincloss: For what purpose?
Ann Kite: To sign a private --
Mr. Mesereau: Same objection.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: To sign a private investigator's confidentiality agreement.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are you a private investigator?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you understand what that would have done to you if you had signed such an agreement?
Ann Kite: I had an idea, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Calls for speculation, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have an understanding as to the effect, the legal effect of that agreement, if you signed it?
Mr. Mesereau: Foundation; speculation.
Mr. Auchincloss: Goes to her intent as to whether she wanted to sign the agreement or not.
Mr. Auchincloss: I can ask another foundational question.
The Court: All right. Go ahead.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you sign that agreement?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why not?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Relevance; hearsay; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Ann Kite: Because I believed that it would negatively impact me.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why? In what way?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Speculation; relevance; foundation; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Ann Kite: I believed it was designed to shut me up.
Mr. Auchincloss: Based on your performance as a PR person for Michael Jackson, how would you evaluate your attempted performance or your attempt to help him in a PR sense?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay; relevance, foundation; calls for speculation; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: How is this hearsay? I don't see any -- this is her evaluation. This is a spurious objection.
Mr. Mesereau: An opinion.
The Court: I'll sustain the objection and relevancy. An opinion of her own performance.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever form an opinion, based on everything that happened during this period of time that you were working for Mr. Jackson and the time immediately preceding it, as to why they terminated you? Based on all the conduct of the parties, based on all you knew about this case and your job, did you ever form an opinion as to why you were terminated?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was your -- what's your opinion on that?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Opinion; relevance.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Not a proper lay opinion?
The Court: The objection was sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: After your termination, Ms. Kite, did you have a conversation with David LeGrand about Janet Arvizo?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: It's -- it's a yes or no question. It is not hearsay. And it's hardly leading. It's just an open-ended question, whether she had a conversation.
The Court: Objection is overruled. She did answer. She said, "Yes, I did."
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: When did this conversation take place?
Ann Kite: Approximately a week to ten days after I was terminated.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you in a room with him? Telephone? You tell me.
Ann Kite: We were on the telephone.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did he convey some information to you about Janet Arvizo?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did he say to you?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay; foundation; relevance.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered in furtherance of the conspiracy.
The Court: The objection is overruled.
Ann Kite: He said that they no longer had to worry about Janet Arvizo because they had her on tape and they were going to make her look like a crank whore.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you, Ms. Kite. No further questions.
The Court: Cross-examine?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please, Your Honor.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Good morning.
Ann Kite: Good morning.
Mr. Mesereau: Ms. Kite, my name is Thomas Mesereau and I speak for Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm going to object to counsel's preamble concerning who he represents.
The Court: Overruled. (Laughter.)
Mr. Mesereau: Ms. Kite, I'd like to refer you to Exhibit 410, which is a document the prosecutor showed you, which has names and phone numbers on it. Do you see that document? I think it's labeled as 410 in the book you have.
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: And just for the record, that is a document you referred to while the prosecutor was asking you questions, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And it's a document that appears to have names and phone numbers on it only, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you looked at that document when you were testifying and you gave the names of people who were on the team, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And this was the team that you worked with for purposes of public relations, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Does Mr. Jackson's name appear on that document?
Ann Kite: No, sir, it does not.
Mr. Mesereau: Does Mr. Jackson's phone number appear on that document?
Ann Kite: No, sir, it does not.
Mr. Mesereau: And while you were working with this team, you never met Mr. Jackson, correct?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: And you never spoke with Mr. Jackson, correct?
Ann Kite: No, I did not, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You never met any of the Arvizos, correct?
Ann Kite: That's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And at that time you never spoke to the Arvizos, correct?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever been to Neverland?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I have not.
Mr. Mesereau: How long were you employed by this team?
Ann Kite: From the 9th of February to the 15th of February.
Mr. Mesereau: So you were brought on board on the 9th?
Ann Kite: Officially, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You were terminated on the 15th?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: So you worked for less than a week?
Ann Kite: That's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, while you worked on this team for less than a week, did you have other clients?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: How many other clients were you working for during this six-day period?
Ann Kite: Just one.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Who was that?
Ann Kite: Webcaster Alliance.
Mr. Mesereau: And you have represented that client for a long time; have you not?
Ann Kite: At that time, no, I had not.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, did you have a position with that client as well?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: What was your position with that client?
Ann Kite: The president.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You were president of the Webcaster Alliance, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Would you please tell the jury what the Webcaster Alliance is?
Ann Kite: The Webcaster Alliance is an organization that supports Internet-related webcasters, support services, manufacturers, anything to do with broadcasting music over the Internet.
Mr. Mesereau: And how many people are members of that -- or excuse me, let me rephrase that. How many people were members of that alliance at this particular time?
Ann Kite: At that time I don't remember specifically. I think it was a little bit over 100, but I'm not sure.
Mr. Mesereau: In the six days that you represented Mr. Jackson, as you described it, and were president of this alliance, did you think you became an expert on Mr. Jackson's life?
Ann Kite: Oh, no, sir, I would never profess to be an expert on anybody's life.
Mr. Mesereau: Please answer my question.
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: During the six days you claim you worked for this team, did you think you became an expert on Mr. Jackson's music?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. During the six days that you worked with this team, and at the same time were president of the Webcaster Alliance, you didn't really become an expert on anything associated with Mr. Jackson, did you?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you were very concerned that these people were ripping off Mr. Jackson, didn't you?
Ann Kite: I don't remember saying that, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever tell anything to the Santa Barbara sheriff that suggested you thought these people were taking advantage of Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: I don't remember saying anything like that, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You met with the Santa Barbara sheriffs approximately when; do you know?
Ann Kite: I believe it was in March of 2004.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. It was approximately March 11th, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you gave them a lengthy statement, did you not?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, was that statement recorded?
Ann Kite: Yes, I believe it was.
Mr. Mesereau: And were you told that your statement was going to appear in the form of a police report?
Ann Kite: I don't remember, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you discussed your statement with anyone on the prosecution team at any time?
Ann Kite: The statement in the police report?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did you last discuss that with any member of the prosecution team?
Ann Kite: I don't remember. Sometime probably in the last couple weeks.
Mr. Mesereau: Who did you talk to about that?
Ann Kite: To Gordon, Mr. Auchincloss.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that's the prosecutor who just asked you questions, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he give you a copy of that police report to look at?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you read it?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you discuss its contents with Mr. Auchincloss?
Ann Kite: I don't understand your question.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you discuss the contents of that police report with Mr. Auchincloss?
Ann Kite: I discussed --
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase the --
Ann Kite: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Maybe I'm being --
Ann Kite: Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be stupid.
Mr. Mesereau: No, you're not. Don't worry. Mr. Auchincloss gave you a copy of the police report, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: He asked you to read it, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: And it's a pretty long report, isn't it?
Ann Kite: Yes, it is.
Mr. Mesereau: And, in fact, it goes for many pages, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, it does.
Mr. Mesereau: And it is a narrative summary about what you told the police, true?
Ann Kite: Yes, it is.
Mr. Mesereau: What you told the sheriffs?
Ann Kite: Yes, it is. That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And it actually -- you had an approximately 90-minute conversation with the sheriffs in March when you were interviewed, true?
Ann Kite: Yes, somewhere around there. I don't remember the time. But it was lengthy.
Mr. Mesereau: You told them a lot of things you haven't said today, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: You told them a lot of things that you felt about the way the so-called team was handling Mr. Jackson --
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: -- correct?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you are referred to as Ann Gabriel in the report, correct?
Ann Kite: That's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: That was your name at the time, right?
Ann Kite: That's the name I used professionally.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was your name Kite at the time, your legal name?
Ann Kite: My legal name is still Kite, but I go professionally by Ann Gabriel.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And your understanding was that you would be referred to as "Gabriel" in the police report, true?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs that you are the owner of Gabriel Media, Inc., right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were asked how you got involved in this matter, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you told the police that you were hired by Attorney David LeGrand, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you had previously dated David LeGrand, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't tell that to the police at that time, correct?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, did you stop dating Mr. LeGrand when you were hired by the team?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you and LeGrand had a professional relationship only at that time?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And are you telling the jury that you ended the dating relationship just as you began this professional task?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you and Mr. LeGrand talk about the fact that it might not look good if you guys were dating while you took this job?
Ann Kite: No, sir, we did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever disclose to other members of this team that you and Mr. LeGrand had dated before?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: You both agreed to keep that hidden, right?
Ann Kite: No, sir. We never agreed on anything. We never discussed it. We never agreed or disagreed or talked at all about hiding it or not hiding it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, let me just explore that a little bit. You and Mr. LeGrand are dating, and suddenly you decide to be hired as a professional public relations person, true?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You and Mr. LeGrand were dating right up until the very moment that you were hired as a professional by this team?
Ann Kite: No, sir, not right up until the very moment.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How much time was there between your relationship ending and you being hired to do public relations for this team?
Ann Kite: My relationship with Mr. LeGrand on a personal level --
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: -- stopped for that moment at the end of January, but it was always hanging out there.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And I'm not trying to pry into the nature of your relationship at all.
Ann Kite: No, I have no problem answering your question. I just want you to understand specifically, that for that moment in January, when we decided not to see each other personally anymore --
Mr. Mesereau: Right.
Ann Kite: -- it had nothing to do with any professional performance that he may engage me in in the future.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now --
Ann Kite: We were involved in other projects together on the professional side.
Mr. Mesereau: When you were dating up until -- is it the 9th of January, is that what you said?
Ann Kite: No, the end of January.
Mr. Mesereau: The end of January. When you were dating Mr. LeGrand up until the end of January, did you ever discuss the possibility of your being hired to do public relations for this team?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point, you must have both agreed, '"We're going to terminate the relationship and I'm going to be hired on the team," right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; argumentative.
The Court: It's asked and answered. Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Needless to say, you never told Mr. Jackson that you had had this prior relationship, right?
Ann Kite: Oh, no, sir, I never spoke to Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Never wrote him either?
Ann Kite: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Now, when the prosecutor was asking you questions about the people you were working with, remember you said you thought Mr. Jackson was at the top?
Ann Kite: I don't remember the prosecutor asking me anything about if I thought Mr. Jackson was at the top.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, during his questions of you yesterday, do you remember he sort of tried to emphasize that Mr. Jackson was at the top of some structure?
Ann Kite: I don't remember him bringing Mr. Jackson's name up at the top of a structure. I believe he asked me about the team that I worked with.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, at no time when you were interviewed by the police or the sheriffs did you ever say Mr. Jackson was on this team, right?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Because based upon your experience, Mr. Jackson wasn't on this team, correct?
Ann Kite: That's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You described the team to the Santa Barbara sheriffs as composed of the following individuals: Mr. LeGrand, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Mark Geragos, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Stuart Backerman, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Ronald Konitzer?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And Dieter Weizner, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs there were also attorneys from the UK, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: But you told them you had not spoken with them or met them, true?
Ann Kite: No, I never said I had not spoken with them. I'm sure I had said I had not met them since they were in the UK. But I couldn't say I had not spoken with them when I had been on conference calls with them.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you this page in the report?
Ann Kite: Sure. Absolutely, you can.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
Ann Kite: Oh, yes. I had not spoken with them or met them up until the point that Mr. LeGrand sent me the e-mail welcoming me to the team. That's what that's about.
Mr. Mesereau: Doesn't say that there, does it?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's what that paragraph says.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me just -- for the record --
The Court: Counsel, you've showed her something to refresh her recollection.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Mrs. Kite, early in your interview with the Santa Barbara sheriffs, you told them you had not spoken with or met with attorneys from the UK, true?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you had been brought in by Mr. LeGrand because Mr. LeGrand was not PR savvy, true?
Ann Kite: That's correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told them there was a huge media crisis due to the Martin Bashir interview, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs you believed you had the ability to read what was going on, in connection with the press, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You thought your connections with the press were pretty good, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs you had been involved in public relations for approximately 20 years?
Ann Kite: That's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's correct, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me, it was at the time, right?
Ann Kite: Yeah. I'm a little older now, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And you also told them you had done broadcasting, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: What broadcasting had you done?
Ann Kite: I had done Internet broadcasting.
Mr. Mesereau: Can you please explain what that is?
Ann Kite: Sure, absolutely. It's just like television, but it's done over the Internet.
Mr. Mesereau: How long had you done that at that time?
Ann Kite: At that time, since 1997. So whatever year it was that I spoke with the police. 2004.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you doing Internet broadcasting while you were working with this team?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I was not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Please tell the jury what you were doing as president of the Webcasters Alliance?
Ann Kite: Well, at that point, we were working toward legislation for webcasters to help them be allowed to play music on the Internet. It was more working on the political side.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, who was opposing your efforts to play music on the Internet?
Ann Kite: The Recording Industry Association of America.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And who does that comprise, if you know?
Ann Kite: That comprises the five major labels -- well, there were five at the time. There's three now, so....
Mr. Mesereau: And are you saying it's composed of record labels?
Ann Kite: That's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: What record labels were opposing you at that time?
Ann Kite: The ones that belonged to the Recording Industry Association of America.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know who they were?
Ann Kite: I can give you the majors, which would be Warner Music, Universal, BMG, Sony.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. They were opposing you, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Now --
Ann Kite: They were opposing webcasters.
Mr. Mesereau: Webcasters. All right. Okay.
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: They were opposing them pretty vigorously, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, they were.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know why they were opposing you so vigorously?
Ann Kite: Are you asking me personal opinion or are you asking what they said to the public? They're two different things.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. They gave -- actually, in the course of your work to get legislation passed, the record labels hired lobbyists, didn't they?
Ann Kite: Yes, they did.
Mr. Mesereau: And the lobbyists went around to various politicians opposing what you were trying to do, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, they did that because they felt it would hurt the music industry, at least as far as they're concerned, if you could play this music on the Internet, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, they made a pitch that they could lose a lot of money if this music was played on the Internet, right?
Ann Kite: That was their pitch, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you felt, and the members of your organization felt, that you should be free to take these songs generated by these music companies and play them on the Internet, right?
Ann Kite: Well, no, sir, not the way that you're stating it, that's not correct.
Mr. Mesereau: How would you state it?
Ann Kite: We felt that Internet broadcasters should fall under the same realm as traditional terrestrial radio stations did. And we believed that Internet broadcasting was every bit, if not more so, valuable to performers and artists, especially independent artists who might not have a chance to be heard on traditional terrestrial radio stations.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you certainly knew, while you were doing this, that Mr. Jackson had business arrangements with some of these major record labels, right?
Ann Kite: I knew that Mr. Jackson had spoken out vigorously against the labels earlier. And I knew that he also still had an existing contract or believed that he still had an existing contract with Sony.
Mr. Mesereau: But your position as president of the Webcasters Alliance was against Sony, right, at least as far as that issue was concerned?
Ann Kite: Well, I wouldn't market against Sony. Our position was to try to explain to the labels that we could be every bit as friendly to them as a terrestrial radio station would. We certainly didn't want to be against them. We wanted to help them promote their artists' music and sell more music.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew Mr. Jackson had a relationship with Sony at that time, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever make any effort to advise Mr. Jackson that you might have a conflict of interest, if you were taking this position against Sony while Mr. Jackson was in a business relationship with Sony?
Ann Kite: No, not Mr. Jackson. But Mr. LeGrand was aware of it because Mr. LeGrand was working on the legislation with me.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he tell you there was no problem?
Ann Kite: Well, if Mr. LeGrand was working on the legislation with me and went to the Recording Industry Association of America with me while he was also representing Mr. Jackson, I wouldn't have any reason to think there would be a conflict on my part.
Mr. Mesereau: So correct me if I'm wrong. What you're saying is you never actually discussed a possible conflict, but you assumed, because Mr. LeGrand hired you, it must be okay with Mr. Jackson, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, you're absolutely right.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. All right. You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you were contacted by telephone by Mr. LeGrand regarding your being hired to do public relations work, correct?
Ann Kite: That was not my initial contact with Mr. LeGrand about doing public relation for Michael Jackson; nor was that how I found out that Mr. LeGrand hired me.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you tell the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you had actually spoken with LeGrand in Washington D.C., but you were contacted by telephone regarding the public relations work?
Ann Kite: I had spoken face to face with Mr. LeGrand about doing public relations for Mr. Jackson in Washington D.C.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you the report?
Ann Kite: Yes, you can show it to me. That's fine.
Mr. Mesereau: May I, Your Honor? Thank you.
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that report, Ms. Kite?
Ann Kite: Yes, I have.
Mr. Mesereau: And is the report accurate or inaccurate?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did speak with Mr. LeGrand in Washington D.C. about working for Mr. Jackson. But my recollection is -- as I sit here right now, was receiving an e-mail from Mr. LeGrand on the morning of the 9th of February that said, "Welcome to the team."
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But -- I showed you the report. Does that appear to be slightly inaccurate, as far as you're concerned?
Ann Kite: I don't -- I don't know, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Ann Kite: I'm telling you, sitting here right now, my recollection is that I received an e-mail from Mr. LeGrand --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Ann Kite: -- on the morning of the 9th.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you received an e-mail welcoming you to the team, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: But you told the police that you were contacted by telephone before that about taking the job, right?
Ann Kite: I guess so, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Sound right to you?
Ann Kite: I guess, if you say so.
Mr. Mesereau: No, I'm asking you.
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Had you represented any celebrities before?
Ann Kite: Yes, I have.
Mr. Mesereau: Who had you represented?
Ann Kite: Well, I'm sure you wouldn't consider him a celebrity, but he considers himself one. Would be Mr. Sylver, Marshal Sylver, who lives in Las Vegas.
Mr. Mesereau: Who is he?
Ann Kite: He's an entertainer. He also has done a lot of commercials, infomercials. And he did, you know, television. He was very much into self-hypnosis and things like that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Any other celebrities?
Ann Kite: I have interviewed celebrities, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Correct me if I'm wrong. The question was --
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: The question was, "Did you represent any other celebrities?"
Ann Kite: No, sir, not in the way that I did Mr. Sylver.
Mr. Mesereau: Really, I think what you're saying, he was the only celebrity that you had actually represented as a PR spokesperson --
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: -- before you joined this team?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you said you were an expert at media crisis management, right?
Ann Kite: Are you asking me what I believe?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, I'm asking you what you said.
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Correct me if I'm wrong --
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: -- didn't you tell the jury you were an expert on media crisis management at this point in time?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Did you do media crisis management for Mr. Sylver?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: So, actually, you had only done media crisis management for one person you consider a celebrity before you joined this team?
Ann Kite: For one person that I would consider a celebrity, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You really weren't very experienced in handling media crisis management for celebrities, were you?
Ann Kite: Are you asking me what I believe or are you making a statement?
Mr. Mesereau: I'm asking you to answer a question. You really weren't very experienced in handling media crisis management for celebrities before you joined this team, right?
Ann Kite: I believed I was.
Mr. Mesereau: Because you represented one?
Ann Kite: Because I've seen a lot.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm not asking you what you've seen; I'm asking you what you've done. Okay?
Ann Kite: Yes, I have represented one person that was a celebrity, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. His name was Sylver?
Ann Kite: Marshal Sylver, yes. S-y-l-v-e-r.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, is he on television a lot?
Ann Kite: He had been at the time. I don't believe he is anymore, no.
Mr. Mesereau: He had been in television in what capacity?
Ann Kite: He had produced infomercials.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he appear himself on television?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did these info commercials appear, do you know?
Ann Kite: I don't remember. This was several years ago, and I don't -- I mean, they appeared in a lot of markets.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And were you helping him do the infomercials?
Ann Kite: I was helping him promote himself on the Internet. He had an Internet radio talk show. I was helping schedule other appearances for him on television shows. And we were working on another book for him, and other infomercials that he had in the future, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And just how long did your representation of Mr. Sylver go for?
Ann Kite: I think it was about a year, but I don't remember. This was a while ago.
Mr. Mesereau: And what year was that?
Ann Kite: Maybe around 98 or '99.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So before you joined the team to handle crisis management for Mr. Jackson, you had done this kind of work for one person you considered a celebrity for one year, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you believed that one of your duties was to help the team put together a plan, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And it was supposed to be a plan that would be consistent with your philosophy of being proactive, right?
Ann Kite: I don't understand your question.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I'll break it down. Correct me if I'm wrong, you testified that you wanted to be proactive?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: With respect to the response to the Bashir recording, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And that also was just your general philosophy when it comes to dealing with crisis for celebrities, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you been proactive with Mr. Sylver?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I had.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did he have a crisis?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you feel that you handled the crisis pretty well?
Ann Kite: Did I feel that he handled it very well?
Mr. Mesereau: That you did.
Ann Kite: Yes, I felt that I did. I didn't believe that he did, but I felt that I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Is there any reason why you only spent a year with him?
Ann Kite: Yes, I moved on to other things.
Mr. Mesereau: Like what?
Ann Kite: More Internet broadcasting. I began to get into more technical aspects of promoting products and services.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And out of crisis management?
Ann Kite: No, never out of it. But just -- technology was very fascinating for me, and so I began to do a lot of productions from conventions in Las Vegas. Consumer electronic show, the National Association of Broadcasting. Those types of things. Comdex.
Mr. Mesereau: But your proactive philosophy meant what?
Ann Kite: Did you say "meant what"?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please.
Ann Kite: The proactive philosophy meant that I would -- in terms of taking care of a client, is that what you're asking me?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: That I would assess their assets and vulnerabilities and map out a plan for them to be able to address any issues that might come up in the future and to be able to promote themselves in the manner that they aspire to.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, with all due respect, how do you assess the assets and vulnerabilities of Mr. Jackson if you've never met him?
Ann Kite: Mr. Mesereau, there are millions of people in the world that have never met Mr. Jackson and judge him based on what they read in the media. I believe, for myself, as someone who handles public relations - and I'm not going to term myself as an expert in deference to you - what those people read in the media directly reflects to them who Mr. Jackson is. They have never met him either. So what better way to try to connect with the public's thinking than to read what's printed in the media about him and try to counteract it to his benefit?
Mr. Mesereau: But -- let me repeat my question: You can't really know a person if you haven't met them, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: When you put this plan together, you didn't know the person called Michael Jackson at all, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; asked and answered numerous times.
The Court: Asked and answered; sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that one of the goals of the team was to put together a plan of action, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said another goal of the team was to sue Granada, the company that had produced the Martin Bashir program, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And, to your knowledge, Granada was a British company, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, to my knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: And it was your understanding that there was a lawsuit going on in England, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, was that lawsuit going on when you were hired for those six days, or were you discussing filing a suit?
Ann Kite: I believe it had already been filed, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And is that why you were on the phone call with the British attorneys?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did Mr. LeGrand want you on that phone call?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you mostly reporting to LeGrand at this period of time?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, you're hired for six days, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And during those six days, you're talking to various members of the team, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, what members of the team did you speak to during those six days you were hired?
Ann Kite: You want me to rename them to you?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please.
Ann Kite: Mr. Backerman. Mr. Schaffel. Mr. Konitzer. Mr. Geragos. David LeGrand. And the team in the UK. And you if allow me to look at one of these e-mails, I can read their names off to you, too. Okay?
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Sure. Thank you.
Ann Kite: I'm sorry, I'm looking for the three-page e-mail here.
Mr. Mesereau: That's all right. Take your time. As long as Judge Melville doesn't mind.
Ann Kite: I'm sorry. This is a thick book. Do you have a copy of that three-page e-mail that Gordon showed me earlier? Because the names were listed on there.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me see. I think I do.
Mr. Sneddon: It's 43, Gordon. Page 43.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. You mentioned Backerman, Konitzer, Geragos, LeGrand? And who else? Schaffel?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And the British lawyers, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, and the British -- and the UK crisis management team, Bell Yard.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. And Bell Yard, you had mentioned one woman's name, right?
Ann Kite: Melanie Riley and also Richard. I believe Richard's name is on that e-mail too.
Mr. Mesereau: These are all members of the team that you worked with, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: For those six days?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have any conference calls where every member of the team was on the phone?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I can't remember that we had any conference call when every single member of the team was on the phone.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have face-to-face conversations with the various team members?
Ann Kite: With Mr. LeGrand.
Mr. Mesereau: Anyone else?
Ann Kite: No. Not that I remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever personally met Mr. Schaffel?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I have not.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever personally met Mr. Konitzer?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I have not.
Mr. Mesereau: Never personally met Mr. Geragos?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I have not.
Mr. Mesereau: Never personally met any of the British lawyers?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever personally met Mr. Backerman?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: So one member of the team only you had face-to-face conversations with, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, because Mr. LeGrand was in Las Vegas.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. That's where you were?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, is your office near his?
Ann Kite: It was about 20 minutes away. 25 minutes away.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. During those six days, did you have a lot of meetings with Mr. LeGrand face to face about the team?
Ann Kite: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: How many meetings did you have with Mr. LeGrand during those six days regarding the team?
Ann Kite: Face to face?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please.
Ann Kite: Just one.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have a lot of phone calls with Mr. LeGrand during those six days?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: About the team?
Ann Kite: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: How many phone calls do you think you had with Mr. LeGrand during those six days where you discussed the team?
Ann Kite: I don't understand your question. Are you talking about where we discussed the team as -- as far as it relates to what the team has discussed or where we discussed the team as far as it relates to my objections to things that were going on?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, anything what have so far about the team. So let me restate the question.
Ann Kite: Oh.
Mr. Mesereau: During the six days you were on this team, you've indicated Mr. LeGrand is the only person you ever saw face to face, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you've indicated that you had a lot of phone calls with Mr. LeGrand during those six days to discuss team business?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Approximately how many phone calls do you think you had with Mr. LeGrand during those six days to discuss team business?
Ann Kite: Probably more than 50.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How many phone calls did you have with Mr. Backerman during those six days, if you can guess. Or not guess; if you know.
Ann Kite: As few as possible.
Mr. Mesereau: How many?
Ann Kite: Maybe seven. Between five and seven.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Mr. Backerman really was a competitor of yours, wasn't he?
Ann Kite: No, sir. He wasn't.
Mr. Mesereau: He was in the public relations business, was he not?
Ann Kite: Mr. Backerman was hired as the official spokesperson. It was my understanding that Mr. Backerman was hired as Mr. Jackson's spokesperson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. What was your official title while you were a member of the team?
Ann Kite: I never asked for an official title, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you consider yourself to be?
Ann Kite: Just someone who would handle public relations for Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Did you ever speak to the media directly during those six days?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Who did you speak for?
Ann Kite: I don't remember. I couldn't tell you. I do remember that I was on a couple of phone calls with people from the media. Overflow calls I got directed to me, or calls that Stuart wasn't answering and Bell Yard was concerned about, they wanted me to speak to them directly. And I did speak with Claudia Eaton with NBC.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you spoke to these people, you must have identified yourself as having some role involving Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: I believe I just said I handled public relations for Mr. Jackson. I couldn't -- I mean, I couldn't tell you exactly. But I am pretty sure that I didn't identify myself with a grandiose title.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have any business cards printed up --
Ann Kite: For Mr. Jackson?
Mr. Mesereau: -- that identified you as a spokesperson for Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: No, sir, never.
Mr. Mesereau: Any kind of stationery printed up to identify yourself as a spokesperson for Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: No, sir, never.
Mr. Mesereau: Any kind of name tag or anything?
Ann Kite: No, sir, never.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you have any role in the lawsuit against Granada?
Ann Kite: I don't understand your question.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you've indicated you were on a phone conversation with British lawyers, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And that concerned the lawsuit against Granada, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have any role in that lawsuit, of any kind?
Ann Kite: In how the lawsuit was being portrayed in the press, yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And what did you do during those six days about that?
Ann Kite: I don't understand your question. What actions did I take during those six days, or what considerations were had?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, wham did you ever do during the six days you were on the team to effect the Granada lawsuit?
Ann Kite: Spoke with the other members of the team as far as the public relations were concerned, to put out information about the lawsuit with Granada.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you actually put out information, yourself?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever issue any press release yourself?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I wasn't allowed to.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever issue any type of statement anywhere during those six days?
Ann Kite: Not that I can remember, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you think during those six days you had learned enough to really understand that litigation in England?
Ann Kite: I wasn't trying to understand the litigation in England, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you were asked by the Santa Barbara sheriffs if you had any say-so in the decision-making of the team. And you said, "Yes and no." Do you remember that?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And you reviewed this report before you came in to testify today, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you last review it?
Ann Kite: I don't know. It was probably about a week or so ago.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you have a copy in your possession?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you sent a copy and given an opportunity to read it?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Then did you have to return the copy?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did the copy go; do you know?
Ann Kite: Yes, it's in Louisiana. I didn't bring it with me.
Mr. Mesereau: Someone sent you the police report in Louisiana?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know who did that?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. Auchincloss do that?
Ann Kite: I'm not --
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you shown that report to anyone?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I have not.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Have you discussed your testimony today with anyone before you came in?
Ann Kite: I don't understand your question. The testimony that I'm giving right now?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: No, sir, I have not.
Mr. Mesereau: You haven't discussed it with anyone before testifying today?
Ann Kite: I don't understand you. Are you asking if I spoke with Mr. Auchincloss? You need to ask me specifically, because I don't understand your term of "anyone."
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know what "anyone" means?
Ann Kite: I do know what "anyone" means, but I don't know what you mean by -- when you say it.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me break it down slowly.
Ann Kite: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you discuss what you were going to say in court today with anyone before you came in and testified?
Ann Kite: No one had told me what to say in court. But Gordon did tell me in general what to expect of the questions from him.
Mr. Mesereau: How long was your meeting with Gordon?
Ann Kite: Yesterday, when I was here?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: You didn't give him much time. I don't know, maybe ten minutes. I don't remember. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: How long was your prior meeting with Gordon?
Ann Kite: The night before?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: A couple of hours.
Mr. Mesereau: And in a couple of hours with Gordon, the night before, you never discussed what you were going to say in this courtroom?
Ann Kite: No. Mr. -- Gordon told me generally what questions he was going to ask me.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Ann Kite: He said that it would be about the same type of things that he went over with me in the grand jury testimony, and that was it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So why did it last two hours?
Ann Kite: Well, I think probably because I had a lot of questions for him also.
Mr. Mesereau: So you were discussing what you were going to say today, right?
Ann Kite: No. That doesn't mean that I was trying to ask him questions about what we were going to discuss today. I was very curious about this whole process and the process of the lawsuit.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever tell Mr. Auchincloss what you intended to say in this courtroom during that meeting that lasted a number of hours the day before yesterday?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't remember that I ever told him what I intended to say during any of my testimony.
Mr. Mesereau: So, Prosecutor Auchincloss told you what he was going to ask you, and you never commented on what you were going to say at any time during that meeting which lasted a couple of hours, right?
Ann Kite: I wouldn't have needed to, sir, because he told me basically it was the same questions that he had already asked me in the grand jury testimony, and I knew what my answers were.
Mr. Mesereau: So why did it take so long, if you know?
Ann Kite: Because, like I said, I was curious about the whole process of the lawsuit. I was asking questions about what the courtroom looked like, and that type of thing.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you didn't ever respond to any of his questions, true?
Ann Kite: Any of what questions?
Mr. Mesereau: When Prosecutor Auchincloss met with you and I said, "I'm going to ask you," whatever the question was, you just didn't comment, right?
Ann Kite: There was no need for me, sir, because he said it would be basically the same questions that he asked me in my grand jury testimony. He didn't say that he was going to ask me anything different, and he didn't say that it was going to deviate.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, let's take the timing. Prosecutor Auchincloss meets with you for a couple of hours. He tells you, "I'm going to ask you the same questions I asked you for the grand jury," which takes about five seconds. What else did you talk about?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; this is argument.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Ms. Kite, you did discuss with Prosecutor Auchincloss things you were going to say in court today, didn't you?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; these questions have been asked and answered numerous times.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: How many conference calls with attorneys from the United Kingdom did you have -- excuse me. Let me rephrase that. How many conference calls did you participate in with attorneys from the UK during the six days you were hired?
Ann Kite: With just the attorneys, or with the Bell Yard also?
Mr. Mesereau: Just with the attorneys.
Ann Kite: I don't know. Maybe five or six. One a day.
Mr. Mesereau: And how many conference calls did you have with other people employed in the United Kingdom during those six days?
Ann Kite: At least double or triple that, because I talked to Bell Yard several times a day.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, were you giving Bell Yard your ideas about public relations issues in England?
Ann Kite: Is your question was I giving Bell Yard information about how I felt they should handle public relations issues in England? No, sir --
Mr. Mesereau: Sure.
Ann Kite: -- I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Were they calling you for advice on what to do in England?
Ann Kite: No. They weren't calling me for advice on what to do in England. We were talking together to be able to coordinate the same type of public relations effort between the United Kingdom and the United States.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your understanding that Bell Yard was issuing press releases in England during those six days?
Ann Kite: I believe they issued one or two, but I don't know how many. They -- I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see the one or two statements that they issued?
Ann Kite: Yes, I believe I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did they fax them to you?
Ann Kite: E-mailed them to me, I believe.
Mr. Mesereau: Did they ask you for your thoughts on the content?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you give them the thoughts on the content?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you feel they followed your advice?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: So you never had any dispute with Bell Yard in England with respect to public relations, correct?
Ann Kite: No, sir. Bell Yard and I agreed very much on how we felt that the public relations effort should be handled for Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, you've testified that you thought these team members -- not including Mr. Jackson, because he wasn't on the team -- these team members overruled your ability to be proactive; is that correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir. That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: But you felt they didn't overrule Bell Yard's efforts to be proactive, correct?
Ann Kite: No, sir, that's not correct. I believed that they did overrule Bell Yard also.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you think the statements that you saw issued by Bell Yard during those six days were proactive?
Ann Kite: There was an issue with Bell Yard when I was brought on.
Mr. Mesereau: And you had an issue with them?
Ann Kite: No, there was an issue within the team with Bell Yard when I was brought on.
Mr. Mesereau: Here's what I'm getting at: And if I misstate something, just tell me.
Ann Kite: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the jury you were overruled in your desire to make a public statement on behalf of the team, right?
Ann Kite: Okay. Then I understand where you're going. And let me answer you this way: The press releases that were put out by Bell Yard during that time mainly had to do with the lawsuit against Granada, and didn't at all affect the crisis issues that I felt were negatively impacting Mr. Jackson's reputation.
Mr. Mesereau: But the crisis involving Bell Yard was a crisis concerning the Bashir program, right?
Ann Kite: It was concerning the program itself. It didn't concern the attacks that were being launched against Mr. Jackson about everything else.
Mr. Mesereau: The lawsuit was filed by attorneys for Mr. Jackson, true?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And Mr. Bashir was sued, correct?
Ann Kite: I don't remember, sir. I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And Granada was the company that produced the Bashir show, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, the lawsuit had to do with their not meeting their obligations --
Ann Kite: To my --
Mr. Mesereau: -- to Mr. Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: To my knowledge, I believed that the lawsuit was launched to stop the distribution of additional footage. Not to attack the integrity of the lawsuit, or the integrity of the documentary.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever read any of the legal documents filed in the lawsuit?
Ann Kite: I don't remember, sir. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: After your conference calls with the attorneys in England, did anyone ever send you copies of the legal documents that were filed in that lawsuit, if you remember?
Ann Kite: I don't remember if there were copies that were sent to me. But I do believe that there were snippets of issues that needed to be addressed or things that were going to be put into the lawsuit, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When were you first -- let me strike that. Did you have a conference call with those attorneys the first day you were hired?
Ann Kite: I don't remember. I remember having several calls, but I don't remember if it was the attorneys that were on the call or not. That short six-day period of time, as you classify it, was basically 24 hours a day for me, and there was so much that happened. And I couldn't tell you exactly if there was anything that first day.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you were on a conference call with Mr. Konitzer and Mr. Geragos, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs you were on two conference calls to the United Kingdom that included Konitzer and Geragos, right?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you believe you were reporting to Mr. Geragos?
Ann Kite: I believed that Mr. Geragos was one of the persons that I did speak to. But as far as the hierarchy is concerned, Mr. Konitzer told me that Mr. Schaffel was in charge of public relations for Michael Jackson. There were times that Mr. Geragos called me and spoke to me about certain issues regarding public relations; there was times that Mr. Konitzer called me; and there was times that I spoke with Mr. Schaffel or I spoke with Mr. LeGrand. So, I mean, there wasn't a direct pecking order that I had to report to. It depended on what it was that they were looking for.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, was it your understanding, if Mr. Geragos asked you to do something, that you were supposed to do it?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your understanding, if Mr. Konitzer asked you to do something, that you were supposed to do it?
Ann Kite: Generally, if Mr. Konitzer asked me to do something, I called Mr. LeGrand.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Let me just rephrase the question. Was it your understanding -- and either it was or it wasn't -- that you were supposed to do what Mr. Konitzer asked you to do?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was it your understanding that, during those six days, you were supposed to do what Mr. Schaffel asked you to do?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your understanding that you were supposed to do whatever Mr. Backerman asked you to do?
Ann Kite: No, sir, never.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever feel you reported to Backerman?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever try to replace Mr. Backerman?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you think you were supposed to do what the British lawyers asked you to do during those six days?
Ann Kite: The British lawyers never asked me to do anything. We -- again, on the conference calls that we had, we were discussing how the public relations effort between the UK and the United States would mesh together, so there was never a directive from the British lawyers. It was more of a summation of the day's events and how they would be handled in the press.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, a sheet of names and phone numbers that you were presented by the prosecutor is Exhibit 410, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you have that in front of you?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, is that a sheet that you used during your work?
Ann Kite: It may -- they sent me several different iterations of contact numbers. This isn't anything that was ever typed up that I saw.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So when did you first see this document?
Ann Kite: I don't remember when I first saw it.
Mr. Mesereau: Did the prosecutor show it to you?
Ann Kite: They very well may have. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, before you came into court to testify and began to answer questions from Prosecutor Auchincloss, have you ever seen the document?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: I may have. I just don't remember. There was several different iterations of documents that were sent, of e-mails that were sent to me with names and phone numbers on them. This may have been one of the iterations. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: When you met with Prosecutor Auchincloss, did he ever show you this document and say he was going to ask you about names and numbers on the document?
Ann Kite: No, sir, he did not.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, is the first time you ever saw this thing when you were shown it in court?
Ann Kite: To my knowledge, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, what makes me curious is your own name and number is on that document, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection to the form of the question.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't have a document of phone numbers and names that had your own on it, did you?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, the iterations of information that I was sent contained everyone's phone number. We would include mine too.
Mr. Mesereau: And were you sent Exhibit 410?
Ann Kite: I don't know, sir. I was sent several iterations.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, there's a number for Gavin Arvizo on that document. Do you see that?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have a document with Gavin Arvizo's number?
Ann Kite: I don't remember, sir. I was sent several iterations of documents. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you certainly know who Gavin Arvizo is, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: And if you had been carrying around a document with his name and number, you'd probably remember that, wouldn't you?
Ann Kite: I didn't carry it around. It came to me in an e-mail and I only accessed the numbers that I needed.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But certainly you're testifying that Mr. Auchincloss didn't go over this document before you testified?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: The questions just came out fresh and cold, as far as you're concerned, right?
Ann Kite: As far as I'm concerned, yes, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Argumentative; asked and answered.
Mr. Mesereau: I withdraw it.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that Mr. Geragos had the final say-so on everything, did you not?
Ann Kite: I told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that I was told that Mr. Geragos had the final say-so, yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And who told you that Mr. Geragos had the final say-so on everything?
Ann Kite: Mr. LeGrand and Mr. Konitzer.
Mr. Mesereau: And during those six days you were employed, you operated with the understanding that essentially the buck stopped with Mr. Geragos, right?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that on major things, you were to answer to Schaffel, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you answer to Schaffel during those six days?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How many times do you think you spoke to Schaffel on the phone during those six days?
Ann Kite: It would be very hard for me to estimate. Maybe ten, maybe 15.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And was it your understanding that Mr. Schaffel was in charge of Mr. Jackson's public relations?
Ann Kite: That's what Mr. Konitzer told me, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Konitzer told you that?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: And obviously Mr. Jackson never told you that?
Ann Kite: No, sir, he did not. I never spoke to Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you thought Mr. Schaffel answered to Konitzer, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And why did you think that?
Ann Kite: Why did I think that?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: Because Mr. Konitzer told me to -- that Mr. Schaffel was in charge of Michael Jackson's public relations. And obviously Mr. Schaffel would have to answer to someone and to me. That someone would be Mr. Konitzer.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When did you last talk to Mr. Schaffel?
Ann Kite: It was either the 13th or the 14th of February. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: And that would be that year?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you talked to Mr. Schaffel since you were terminated?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you talked to Mr. Konitzer since you were terminated?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you talked to Mr. Geragos since you were terminated?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you last talk to Mr. Geragos?
Ann Kite: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Can you tell me approximately when it was?
Ann Kite: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it this year?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it last year?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it the year before last, if you know?
Ann Kite: It would have probably been shortly after I was terminated. Maybe, you know, a few days or something. And then -- I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you consider yourself to be on good terms with Mr. Geragos?
Ann Kite: I wouldn't consider myself either way, to be on any terms with Mr. Geragos.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When did you last talk to Mr. Backerman?
Ann Kite: On the 14th of February.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you've not been in touch with him since you were terminated?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, did you include someone named Dieter Weizner as a member of the team?
Ann Kite: I never met Dieter, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever talk to him on the phone?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I never did.
Mr. Mesereau: So no contact with him ever?
Ann Kite: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you knew that Konitzer had obtained a power of attorney over Michael Jackson, true?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you know that Konitzer had obtained a power of attorney on behalf of Michael Jackson?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Hearsay, unless this witness has personal knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: I asked how she learned, Your Honor. State of mind.
The Court: The objection is overruled. You may answer the question. Do you want it read back?
Ann Kite: No. Mr. LeGrand told me.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And approximately when did he tell you that Konitzer had gotten a power of attorney over Michael Jackson?
Mr. Auchincloss: Same objection.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: Are you asking me when he actually physically signed the power of attorney or when Mr. LeGrand told me that it was going to be signed?
Mr. Mesereau: I'm asking you when you learned that Konitzer was going to have a power of attorney over Michael Jackson.
Ann Kite: At the end of January.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When you first heard about it, was it your understanding that it had already been signed or was it about to be signed?
Ann Kite: It was about to be signed.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And do you remember why -- excuse me. Let me rephrase. In what context did Mr. LeGrand discuss that with you, if you know? Why did it come up?
Ann Kite: David had been telling me for a while that he was preparing to take on a new client, that he had been working on it for a number of months. I think it was probably close to a year. And he was excited about it. He never told me who the client was until he told me about the power of attorney and who the client was.
Mr. Mesereau: And was it your understanding that David LeGrand prepared that power of attorney?
Ann Kite: Yes, it was.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever learn that David LeGrand had commenced an investigation of Schaffel, Konitzer, Dieter, Geragos, Malnik?
Ann Kite: I asked Mr. LeGrand to start an investigation.
Mr. Mesereau: And you did that because you thought they were stealing from Michael Jackson, correct?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; argumentative.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: No, sir. I did that because I couldn't understand why they would allow Mr. Jackson's reputation to fall into total ruin in the press.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, didn't you tell the police that you had learned that Konitzer used the power of attorney to embezzle $980,000 from Michael Jackson?
Ann Kite: I told --
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Hearsay; multiple hearsay.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Ann Kite: I told the police that Mr. LeGrand told me that.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, correct me if I'm wrong, didn't you say to the Santa Barbara sheriffs Konitzer had power of attorney and he embezzled $980,000 from Michael Jackson?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that was my statement. But your're phrasing it in a way that I didn't say it. I did say that he did have power of attorney, and he embezzled $980,000, but that was told to me by Mr. LeGrand. I had no personal knowledge of Mr. Konitzer take the money from Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: So your source was strictly David LeGrand, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately when he told you that Konitzer had used that power of attorney to embezzle $980,000 from Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: It was somewhere in the beginning of March. But I don't remember the exact date.
Mr. Mesereau: So that was after you were terminated, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, after you were terminated, you --
The Court: Counsel, can we take our break?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, Your Honor.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: You may proceed.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor. It's almost noontime.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When you had your interview with the Santa Barbara sheriffs, you were asked by Detective Zelis if you knew if Michael Jackson was aware of what the team was doing, do you remember that?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told him you had no idea whether Michael knew anything about it, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection, Your Honor. Calls for speculation; no foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Ann Kite: As you said, I have never talked to Michael Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: But you told Detective Zelis you had no idea whether Michael Jackson knew what this team was doing, correct
Ann Kite: That's correct. Because I never spoke with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You tried to speak to him, didn't you?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you tell the Santa Barbara sheriffs that on one occasion you asked Mr. Konitzer to get Michael Jackson on the phone to find out about the contract with Martin Bashir, right?
Ann Kite: No, sir, that wasn't me that asked to get Michael Jackson on the phone. That was an attorney from the UK. That's -- that's the incident that I was relating to the police.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you tell the police - correct me if I'm wrong - you asked Konitzer to get Michael Jackson on the phone to find out about the contract concerning the Bashir interview, and you told him that Konitzer would say, "He's busy," referring to Jackson, correct?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't remember saying that.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you the report?
Ann Kite: You can show me the report. But the incident that you're talking about, I remember very vividly. And it didn't have anything to do with me telling Mr. Konitzer to get Mr. Jackson on the phone. It was an attorney from the UK who was very upset at the lack of responsiveness from Mr. Jackson about his not being on these conference calls that he felt were extremely important.
Mr. Mesereau: You actually said you tried to get him on the phone and the attorney in Britain tried to get him on the phone, and you both failed, correct?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't remember saying I tried -- I didn't have a phone number for Mr. Jackson. How would I try to get him on the phone?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you asked Mr. Konitzer to put him on the phone, didn't you?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; argumentative.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you the report?
Ann Kite: You can --
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. He's asked the witness if it would refresh her recollection, and she said it would not.
The Court: No, actually she did say that, but she said something else, too. Would it refresh your recollection to be shown that report?
Ann Kite: You can show me the report, but I remember the incident very specifically. And I would never tell Mr. Konitzer to get Mr. Jackson on the phone.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: No, she says that she remembers specifically.
Mr. Mesereau: In other words, if the report of the police officer, which I remind you was recorded, says you told them, "I asked Mr. Konitzer to get Mr. Jackson on the phone, and he told me he was busy," that would be wrong?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you believed Konitzer, Schaffel and Weizner created an environment that allowed Jackson to pursue his other interests while they ran the day-to-day operation of his business matters?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever ask any member of the team at any time if you could get Mr. Jackson on the phone?
Ann Kite: Not to my knowledge, sir, no.
Mr. Mesereau: You were asked by the Santa Barbara sheriffs if you had ever met Dr. Farshshian, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's right.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said you had not?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I had not.
Mr. Mesereau: You also told him you had never met the Arvizo family, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you've described what Schaffel told you had happened with Janet Arvizo at the ranch, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: But your knowledge of that only came from Schaffel, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And it goes without saying, Mr. Jackson was not involved in that conversation, correct?
Ann Kite: That's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Schaffel also told you that Janet Arvizo was going to sell her story to a British tabloid, correct?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell the police that Schaffel told you Janet was selling a story to a British tabloid?
Mr. Auchincloss: Same objection.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: As part of your work during those six days, you had to consider what to do if Ms. Arvizo sold a story to a British tabloid, right?
Ann Kite: At that -- are you asking me at that point, or are you asking me before that?
Mr. Mesereau: I'm not talking about any point. I'm asking you if you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you were considering what to do if Janet Arvizo sold her story to a British tabloid.
Ann Kite: I don't remember that.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you the report?
Ann Kite: Absolutely, sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I show her the report?
The Court: You may.
Ann Kite: That's what I said.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at your report?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about that issue?
Ann Kite: Yes, it does.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. In the course of your duties during those six days, did you take into consideration what to do if and when Janet Arvizo sold her story to a British tabloid?
Ann Kite: I didn't know what story Miss Arvizo could sell to a British tabloid.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever, during those six days, as part of your work, discuss the possibility of Ms. Arvizo selling a story to a British tabloid with any member of the team?
Ann Kite: No, because no one would go over the crisis plan with me. I couldn't discuss anything with anyone because they all had different agendas.
Mr. Mesereau: So you never discussed it with Schaffel, correct?
Ann Kite: I never discussed what the team would do if Miss Arvizo sold a story to the British tabloids, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever tell the Santa Barbara sheriffs that Schaffel told you he was going to fax you a letter about that?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I certainly did.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you tell them anything else about that issue?
Ann Kite: That I never received a letter from Mr. Schaffel.
Mr. Mesereau: But you told them Schaffel told you he was going to fax you a letter about Janet Arvizo selling a story to the tabloids; is that correct?
Ann Kite: No, sir, that's not what I said.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection, hearsay.
Ann Kite: That's not what I said.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you say?
Mr. Auchincloss: I have an objection pending.
The Court: Just a moment. The objection's sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever discuss with the Santa Barbara sheriffs that Schaffel had told you he was concerned that Janet Arvizo was going to make a deal with the British tabloids?
Mr. Auchincloss: Same objection.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, the only knowledge you ever had about the Arvizos leaving the ranch was through Schaffel, right?
Ann Kite: No, I discussed it later in the day with Mr. Konitzer.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you first learned about it through Schaffel, didn't you?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did you discuss it with Schaffel and Konitzer?
Ann Kite: Not at the same time, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: At any time?
Ann Kite: On separate occasions on the 13th, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And at some point you learned the Arvizo family had returned to the ranch, right?
Ann Kite: I was told that.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that by Schaffel?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you testified that Schaffel told you "the situation is contained," correct?
Ann Kite: Had been contained, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Is that after he told you the Arvizos had returned to the ranch?
Ann Kite: No, sir, that was in the same conversation.
Mr. Mesereau: So he told you they're back at the ranch, the situation's contained; is that right?
Ann Kite: I think he told me it the other way around, but, yes, that's pretty much the way I remember it.
Mr. Mesereau: And was that after Schaffel told you that he thought Janet Arvizo was selling a story to the British tabloids?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, it was.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. You told the police the first thing you wanted to do was laugh, because it sounded like something out of a bad "B" movie, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the police you remember these dates because you had a rental car you were driving, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you had to renew the rental, the weekly rental agreement, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You told them the rental office opened at 7:30 a.m., and that was the time you received the call on your cellular phone from Schaffel, correct?
Ann Kite: It was -- I received the call on my phone from Schaffel as I was driving into the parking structure --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Ann Kite: -- yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the next day is when you flew from Las Vegas to Hollywood to film the show Access Hollywood, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told Detective Zelis you never asked Schaffel what the story was that Janet was supposedly going to sell to the British tabloids, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And after Schaffel told you "The situation is contained," you called David LeGrand, correct?
Ann Kite: Later that day, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you were concerned about what Schaffel had told you, true?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You told David LeGrand you were concerned about Schaffel, Backerman, Konitzer and Weizner, correct?
Ann Kite: I don't think I said Weizner, because I didn't think at the time that I even knew that Dieter was part of the group.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you the report?
Ann Kite: Certainly.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
Mr. Auchincloss: May I see it, Counsel?
Mr. Mesereau: Sure. That's what he's referring to. That's her interview.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, that's his impression.
Mr. Mesereau: We'll see.
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Your Honor, may the record reflect that the document that was shown the witness in this case had parentheses around the names that were provided by --
Ann Kite: I didn't say those names. I said the word "they."
Mr. Mesereau: So when the police officer said, referring to those names, he just pulled that out of someplace?
Ann Kite: I did not say those names. And I know I wouldn't have said Dieter's name, because I -- I hadn't spoken to Dieter.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, at this point you were concerned about what the team was doing; is that right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Would the team refer to all of the people that you had previously identified as members of the team?
Ann Kite: Except for Bell Yard and the attorneys on the UK side, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: So Geragos, Konitzer, Schaffel?
Ann Kite: Schaffel, Backerman.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you concerned about what LeGrand was doing?
Ann Kite: No, I felt that David was under a lot of pressure, and, you know, I had no reason to suspect that at that time he would be doing anything wrong.
Mr. Mesereau: But at that point, LeGrand was telling you he was suspicious of the other members of the team, wasn't he?
Ann Kite: No. Not at that point.
Mr. Mesereau: At some point he did, didn't he?
Ann Kite: At some point later, yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, when you arrived in Los Angeles to go on Access Hollywood, did you talk to any member of the team on the phone after you arrived?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Who did you talk to?
Ann Kite: David LeGrand.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever talk to Konitzer that day?
Ann Kite: Not that day, I don't believe so, but I don't remember, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Who told you to appear on that show?
Ann Kite: Well, initially the decision came from Marc Schaffel. And then I spoke -- Access Hollywood sent the questions to me. I forwarded them to Mr. Geragos. We went through them together and created the replies. And then I spent about an hour and a half or so on the phone on Thursday, the 13th, with Mr. Konitzer going over everything for it. So there were -- and then, of course, Mr. LeGrand was aware -- actually, I believe I was in his office on the 11th when I talked to Access Hollywood to initially set something -- to do something up with them, so --
Mr. Mesereau: But you've told the police that you thought Geragos didn't want anybody to do public relations work for Michael Jackson, correct?
Ann Kite: I don't remember saying that specifically. I mean, I don't -- no, I don't remember saying that specifically, that Geragos didn't want anybody to do public relations work for Michael Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you tell the Santa Barbara sheriffs in that interview that you had a theory as to why you were pulled off the Access Hollywood show, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: You told them that you were told by Geragos that you were pulled off the interview because he did not want anyone to do PR work for Michael Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: When I was on the phone with Mr. Geragos when I was on the set of Access Hollywood, that was one of the things that he told me at that time. He didn't say anyone ever, he just said for that day. He wanted me to stay around, to stick in town, he wanted to talk to me. He wanted me to come in the next day, sign a private investigator's agreement, and then he would -- he would fill me in on the rest, is exactly what he said to me.
Mr. Mesereau: Again, let me just rephrase the question. You told the police you were told by Geragos that you were pulled off the interview because he did not want anyone to do PR work for Michael Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: Well, as you said, that's a summary of my tapes --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Ann Kite: -- and I don't remember saying those words exactly.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you tell the police that this made no sense to you?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: It made no sense that Geragos would not want you on the show for that reason; is that correct?
Ann Kite: It made no sense that no one on the team would try to do anything publicly to refute the absolutely horrible things that were coming out about Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you told the police you thought Michael Jackson was being slammed by this team, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, I believe I did.
Mr. Mesereau: The word you used was "slammed," right?
Ann Kite: I believe so, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You thought they were not doing their job to help Michael Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: Well, they were there longer than my six days, so maybe I was wrong.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm not asking maybe. But, basically, your opinion at that point was that this team is not out to protect or help Michael Jackson?
Ann Kite: That was absolutely my opinion, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the police that Access Hollywood had a fax from Mr. Geragos saying, "Don't interview Gabriel," right?
Ann Kite: That's correct, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you actually see the fax?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the police that LeGrand and Geragos clashed over several things, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were getting your information about that from LeGrand, weren't you?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir. That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the police you thought Konitzer brought Geragos in because Konitzer had power of attorney, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay. And --
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- speculation. No foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Ann Kite: Can you repeat the question? I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. You told the police that you believe Konitzer brought in Geragos because Konitzer had a power of attorney, right?
Ann Kite: I believed that because Mr. Konitzer had the power of attorney that allowed him to make the decision to bring Geragos into the team, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, did you discuss that with Mr. LeGrand at any time?
Ann Kite: Did I discuss Mr. Geragos being brought in?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: And that Mr. Konitzer had brought him in?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: I don't remember. I mean, I'm sure that we did, but I don't remember in specifics. I just remember that David was not happy with Mr. Geragos.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever see this power of attorney that Konitzer had --
Ann Kite: No, sir, I never saw it.
Mr. Mesereau: -- over Mr. Jackson? You never saw it?
Ann Kite: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You learned everything about that from Mr. LeGrand, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you were fired through an e-mail by Konitzer, right?
Ann Kite: Well, no. It was through an e-mail by David. David sent me the e-mail.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you told the police that you were fired on February 15th by an e-mail from Konitzer, didn't you?
Ann Kite: David sent me the e-mail. I'm sure that I said that David sent me the e-mail.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you the report?
Ann Kite: You can show me the report, but the e-mail didn't come from Ronald. The e-mail came from David. And I can tell you what it said, if you would like me to.
Mr. Mesereau: No, that's okay. But you're saying you didn't tell the sheriffs Konitzer sent it. You told them David sent it, is that right?
Ann Kite: I don't remember if I said specifically David sent it. But the e-mail said that Ronald made the decision, so that may be why it reads that way.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the police you had sent an e-mail to Konitzer, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the police you sent an e-mail to Konitzer saying, "Schaffel, Backerman and Weizner have no plan of action and that Michael Jackson is going to get skewered on national T.V.," right?
Ann Kite: Again, I would have never said Weizner, because I never heard Dieter's name during that time. And, yes, I probably did say that Michael was going to get skewered. And that was -- one of my major concerns was that there was no plan of action to protect his interests from scurrilous accusations.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Was there ever any discussion between you and members of this team about getting rid of Backerman and Schaffel?
Ann Kite: In the e-mail that I sent to Ronald, I detailed reasons why I thought that he needed to get rid of Mr. Backerman and Mr. Schaffel, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you actually tell him he ought to do that?
Ann Kite: I put it in the e-mail to Mr. Konitzer, yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And why did you think Mr. Backerman should go?
Ann Kite: Because he had done things that I felt were detrimental to the positive public relations effort we were trying to move forward.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. To make a long story short, you thought you had a better plan to protect and represent Mr. Jackson than this team, right?
Ann Kite: I believed that I had Mr. Jackson's public relations interests at heart much more than Mr. Backerman or Mr. Schaffel, yes, absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: What about the other members of the team? Did you think you had more of an interest in doing a good job for Mr. Jackson than the other members, like Mr. Geragos?
Ann Kite: I didn't know what Mr. Geragos's position was. So I can't speak to their intentions. I don't know. I can only speak to what I know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the sheriffs that when you saw the Bashir interview, it disgusted you and made you ill, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told them, the police -- pardon me, I keep saying "police" -- the sheriffs that Konitzer and Weizner have a record of making very bad business deals, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs that Konitzer and Weizner have scammed people out of millions of dollars, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs that after you were fired by Konitzer, Mr. LeGrand hired you to do public relations work, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, was that for his law firm?
Ann Kite: No, that was for him personally.
Mr. Mesereau: Him personally?
Ann Kite: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, was he a partner at a law firm then?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs LeGrand ran a background check on Konitzer, right?
Ann Kite: I didn't hear your question, I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs that LeGrand was doing a background check on Konitzer, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you encourage him to do that?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Because you were suspicious of what Konitzer was up to, right?
Ann Kite: I was suspicious of everything, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: On that team?
Ann Kite: On that team, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell that to Mr. LeGrand?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did. Many, many times.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the sheriffs that it was your understanding that LeGrand and Konitzer had been casual friends for about nine years, right?
Ann Kite: That's what David told me, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the sheriffs you thought Konitzer hired LeGrand because he thought LeGrand would be quiet and just do his job, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct, that's what I said.
Mr. Mesereau: But at some point you learned that LeGrand started an investigation of Konitzer, right?
Ann Kite: At some point I pushed David to go in that direction, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you pushed David to investigate a lot of other people, didn't you, besides Konitzer?
Ann Kite: Who?
Mr. Mesereau: Malnik.
Ann Kite: No. I didn't push David to investigate Al Malnik.
Mr. Mesereau: But you learned that he was investigating him, didn't you?
Ann Kite: I don't remember David ever telling me that he was investigating Al Malnik.
Mr. Mesereau: How about Schaffel?
Ann Kite: I don't remember David ever telling me he was investigating Marc Schaffel either.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you don't know anything about that investigation, if it existed, right?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Never seen any documents that LeGrand showed you about those people being investigated?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the sheriffs that LeGrand would not have investigated if you had not put these questions in his head, right?
Ann Kite: I believe that to be true, yes, because he told me in the beginning that I was overreacting.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you told the sheriffs that once LeGrand started doing his investigation and background checks on Konitzer, he spoke with accounting people and found out Konitzer had embezzled $980,000 from Mr. Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: That was the total figure that he told me, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs that one thing of value that Michael Jackson has is a Sony catalog, correct?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you learn about the Sony catalog?
Ann Kite: Through several sources.
Mr. Mesereau: Can I ask you who they are?
Ann Kite: Well, first of all, public knowledge. And of course David told me.
Mr. Mesereau: And what is your understanding of what the Sony catalog is?
Ann Kite: It's a collection of music, copyrights on music.
Mr. Mesereau: And what kinds of music are you talking about?
Ann Kite: Popular music. But basically music from The Beatles and other artists.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs your understanding was that Sony had an interest in that catalog, along with Mr. Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the sheriffs that you thought Konitzer was being paid to isolate Michael Jackson, create Michael Jackson's downfall so Sony can get the catalog back, didn't you?
Ann Kite: No, that's not what I said.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you the report?
Ann Kite: You can show me the report, but that's not what I said.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever say the following, Ms. Kite: "Gabriel said it makes sense to her that Konitzer and Weizner were being paid to isolate Michael Jackson and let him do his own thing and let him create his downfall so that Sony can get the catalog back"?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never made that statement?
Ann Kite: Not in that way, never, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever tell the sheriffs you thought the recording industry was just as bad as Al Malnik?
Ann Kite: I probably did, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you read this report before you came in to testify, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever point out to anyone that you thought some of the statements were not accurate?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Who was that?
Ann Kite: To Gordon.
Mr. Mesereau: When was this?
Ann Kite: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't remember? You talked to him for a couple of hours two nights ago, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you talk to him about the report then?
Ann Kite: No, I don't believe I did talk to him about the report then.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the sheriffs you're not saying that Sony is paying Konitzer and Weizner, but if you could prove it, you'd love to?
Ann Kite: Yes, I said that as a facetious remark. Absolutely. I did say that.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs you have a lot of sources inside of Sony, correct?
Ann Kite: That's correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the sheriffs that those sources inside of Sony have told you that they've been waiting for years to get the Sony catalog back from Michael Jackson, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the sheriffs that if you look at Konitzer and Weizner's track record, they're not the type of people that should be managing anything for Michael Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's what I believed, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Told the sheriffs, "If you look at their track record, they're not good business people," right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs that they caused Michael Jackson to lose his logo in the United Kingdom?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct, I did say that.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you know that?
Ann Kite: I read that through news reports and I believe David confirmed that for me.
Mr. Mesereau: And you thought -- you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs you thought Konitzer and Weizner were tight with Schaffel, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And you thought they all were hurting Michael Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I do, absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: And you still believe that, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you think somewhere down the line Konitzer and Weizner were going to get a payoff, right?
Ann Kite: I don't remember -- you know, I don't remember using those exact words, and I don't know what context I would use it in.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you the report?
Ann Kite: Sure you can.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at the report?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I have.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said?
Ann Kite: Yes, it does.
Mr. Mesereau: And regardless of where you got your knowledge, I'm just asking if you said this to the sheriffs.
Ann Kite: Yes, I believe I did say that, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: So you told them it made sense to you that down the line Konitzer and Weizner were going to get some kind of payoff?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct. But that payoff could have been from a business interest; it could have been from any number of things.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs you believed that Konitzer, Weizner and Schaffel concocted the business with Janet Arvizo, right?
Ann Kite: Again, I wouldn't have used Dieter's name, because I had no knowledge of Dieter at the time. That I believe they concocted the business with her? Meaning --
Mr. Mesereau: That they were doing something with Arvizo --
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: -- that was harmful to Michael Jackson, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were concerned that Schaffel and Konitzer had done something to Janet Arvizo as well, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: So, basically what you were telling the sheriffs was, you think Michael Jackson's a victim and Janet Arvizo is a victim of these guys, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; that's argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, again, you have no personal knowledge of what happened at the ranch with Miss Arvizo, right?
Ann Kite: You're absolutely correct, sir, I have no personal knowledge of that.
Mr. Mesereau: And you have no personal knowledge of really anything Michael Jackson's done in his lifetime, because you've never been there to watch him, right?
Ann Kite: That's absolutely correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And how many times did you talk to Schaffel about what he said happened to Janet Arvizo at the ranch, do you know?
Ann Kite: After the first phone call in the morning?
Mr. Mesereau: Uh-huh.
Ann Kite: I don't know. Maybe two times, three times total that day. Not many.
Mr. Mesereau: Uh-huh. Did he ever really describe to you what had happened at the ranch?
Ann Kite: Other than telling me that they left the ranch, no.
Mr. Mesereau: And he told you they returned, right?
Ann Kite: He told me that the situation had been contained.
Mr. Mesereau: And he also told you they returned.
Ann Kite: That they had returned, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he ever give you any details about that?
Ann Kite: About how they returned?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: No, sir, he did not.
Mr. Mesereau: So Schaffel never gave you any details about how they left or how they returned, right?
Ann Kite: No. He just said they left in the middle -- in the middle of the night --
Mr. Mesereau: Right.
Ann Kite: -- or sometimeearly in the morning.
Mr. Mesereau: Right.
Ann Kite: And due to his level of agitation, I assumed they didn't go out in a chauffeur-driven limousine.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know how they went out?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I do not.
Mr. Mesereau: Did anyone ever tell you it was a chauffeur- driven car?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever discuss that with Prosecutor Auchincloss?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not, ever.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But at one point you used the word "kidnap," didn't you, to the sheriffs?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I absolutely did.
Mr. Mesereau: But you didn't know she was kidnapped.
Ann Kite: No, I didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew none of the details at all, right?
Ann Kite: No, that was my own personal feeling based on Marc Schaffel's level of agitation.
Mr. Mesereau: I guess it goes without saying, you didn't trust Mr. Schaffel very much either?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't trust Mr. Konitzer either?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you trust Mr. Geragos?
Ann Kite: I didn't trust or distrust Mr. Geragos.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. The ones you were most suspicious about were Schaffel and Konitzer, right? Would that be accurate?
Ann Kite: An accurate reflection would be to say that I was most suspicious about anyone who was taking their eye off of the devastation that was happening to Mr. Jackson at that time.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And I guess it goes without saying, you were concerned about Mr. Jackson's welfare as a public relations professional?
Ann Kite: Absolutely, sir, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You thought he was mistreated and misadvised, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir. For the six days I was there.
Mr. Mesereau: You've told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that Mr. Geragos was being paid by Al Malnik, right?
Ann Kite: I don't remember saying that specifically. You can show me the report, and I remember reading that in the report, but I don't remember saying that specifically to them.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you told them that he was being paid by Malnik, but when they questioned you, you said it was just an assumption, didn't you?
Ann Kite: I believe the context of that comment came from when Mr. Jackson was -- from when the ranch was raided in November, and Mr. Jackson was taken from Las Vegas back to L.A., or back here.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, in referring to this interview, the one I've been asking you all the questions about --
Ann Kite: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: -- you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you assumed Mr. Geragos was being paid by Al Malnik, correct?
Ann Kite: The fee for Mr. Geragos at the time to represent Mr. Jackson. Not during the public relations period that I worked there --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Ann Kite: -- but after, later in the month. Yes, that's what I said.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Ann Kite: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me just get it straight so I understand: You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs you thought Mr. Geragos was being paid by Al Malnik, but you're referring to a period after the six days you had worked?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's absolutely correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Thank you. Now, you made some statements about what you think a proactive public relations effort is. But you knew that a rebuttal film was being prepared that was supposed to be a public relations response to the Bashir tape, correct?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that somebody was getting $3 million for that rebuttal video; right?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your understanding that Schaffel was getting that money?
Ann Kite: No, it was my understanding that it was going into a corporation.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know what corporation?
Ann Kite: Fire Mountain, I believe.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So realistically, you knew that something was being done to respond to the Bashir video, right? Or, excuse me, the Bashir show?
Ann Kite: Realistically, I knew that something was being done. Whether or not it was something that I agreed with or thought was the level that Mr. Jackson deserved is a totally different question.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Schaffel or Konitzer really include you in the production of that rebuttal video?
Ann Kite: What do you mean by "include"?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, during the six days you worked with this team, did they ask you for any advice on how to do a rebuttal video?
Ann Kite: Not on how to do the video. But Mr. Schaffel did call me to discuss with me who would appear on the video. And I told him that I felt very strongly that Mr. Jackson needed to appear on it to refute, himself, the claims that were being made against him.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And were you asked anything else about what your thoughts were on that rebuttal video?
Ann Kite: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that the only suggestion you gave, that you can recall?
Ann Kite: That I can recall sitting right here right now, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you feel in some way that they were cutting you out of the development of that rebuttal video?
Ann Kite: No, I didn't, because there were so many other fires going on and so many other things that needed to be done. And the way that that video was being structured wasn't really anything that I felt that I could give input to anyway.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you think that video was being prepared with Mr. Jackson's interests in mind?
Ann Kite: I believed that Mr. Konitzer and Mr. Schaffel were preparing -- were preparing it with Mr. Jackson's interests in mind, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: But you thought they could do a better job, is that it?
Ann Kite: Absolutely, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you think they had a profit motive in trying to put that video together?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll object and move to strike just as to foundation. And speculation.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs that Schaffel was part of an agreement with FOX Television regarding a rebuttal video, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You told them that it was your understanding Schaffel had reaped some of those profits, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the sheriffs that, if you saw it, you could identify Schaffel's agreement, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you actually see the agreement at one time?
Ann Kite: Yes, I believe I saw a draft copy of the agreement.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you never met Schaffel personally, right?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you end up seeing Schaffel's agreement with FOX Television?
Ann Kite: Because the initial agreement, David LeGrand called me and asked me to have a friend of mine in Chicago, who had done entertainment work, help him prepare it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And who was that?
Ann Kite: Don Hancock.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you help Don Hancock put that agreement together?
Ann Kite: No, he did it pretty much on his own, because I was busy with other things.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And it was your understanding the agreement was strictly between Schaffel and FOX; is that correct?
Ann Kite: No, sir, that --
Mr. Mesereau: What was your understanding in that regard?
Ann Kite: It was my understanding that the agreement was being done on behalf of Mr. Jackson, but that there were stipulations in the agreement that Mr. Schaffel could and would profit from.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. At the time this was all being done, you thought Schaffel was trying to make a large sum of money on this, didn't you?
Ann Kite: I didn't know how much money Mr. Schaffel was trying to make on it. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Schaffel ever discuss that with you?
Ann Kite: How much money he would make on it?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: Not that I remember, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever discuss that with Konitzer?
Ann Kite: How much money Mr. Schaffel would make on something like this?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: Not that I remember, no, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your understanding that Mr. Konitzer was going to make money on this video?
Ann Kite: No, sir. That wasn't my understanding of why the video was being made.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Let me explore that for a second. You certainly believed people were trying to make money on this rebuttal video, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You thought Schaffel was one of them, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you think anyone else was making money on it?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that Konitzer?
Ann Kite: No, it wasn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Who was it?
Ann Kite: Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How did you know that?
Ann Kite: Because David LeGrand told me.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you think LeGrand was going to make any money on it?
Ann Kite: I didn't ask him. I had no idea.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Did you look at the draft of the agreement?
Ann Kite: I don't remember. I may have, but I really -- after I spoke with Don initially, I put him in touch with David, and they pretty much took care of it.
Mr. Mesereau: But you never discussed, obviously, with Mr. Jackson any role he had in this video at all, right?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: And you never actually watched Mr. Jackson play any role in this, did you?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not. No.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs that there were two deals with FOX, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: One was for a $3 million deal and one was a $2 million deal?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: The first was a videotape that Schaffel or someone named Christian had videotaped, right?
Ann Kite: They were involved in it, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And the second had to do with Michael Jackson home videos, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you play any role in the development of these home videos?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever seen the rebuttal video that was telecast by FOX?
Ann Kite: Yes, I believe I did.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you see it?
Ann Kite: I don't remember. I don't remember. It may have been around the time that it was shown or it may have been later. I truly don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see the home videos you referred to?
Ann Kite: I believe I did, but I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you asked advice on the development of the home videos?
Ann Kite: David and I had discussed that before when we talked about a plan to -- to rehabilitate Mr. Jackson's image, but that was before it actually came into being.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the sheriffs that Geragos was paid money by Malnik, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And you learned that from Mr. LeGrand; is that correct?
Ann Kite: I don't remember who I learned that from. And I believe, again, you're talking about the time after I was there for the six days. And I don't remember if it came from Mr. LeGrand or not. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs that you were told by LeGrand that the remaining money owed to Geragos was paid by Al Malnik, to, quote, "keep this thing going," correct?
Ann Kite: Yeah, that's probably true.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the sheriffs you did not know what the connection was, if any, between Malnik and Michael Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Because you've never seen Mr. Malnik with Mr. Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: Just in the newspaper like everyone else, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you never met Mr. Malnik personally, right?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I never did.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs you kept quizzing Mr. LeGrand about Malnik and the video and what this team is doing, right?
Ann Kite: After -- when I went to work for David public-relations-wise? Is that your question?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: I mean, I'm asking you timeframe-wise.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And he would often give you information, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you told them that Mr. LeGrand is scared of an attorney named John Branca, right?
Ann Kite: That's what he told me, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told them that he was scared of Branca because he had fired Mr. Branca, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: "He" being LeGrand?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the sheriffs that Mr. Branca had worked for Mr. Jackson off and on for approximately 20 years, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told them Mr. Branca gets a percentage of music deals that Michael Jackson signs; is that correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you know that?
Ann Kite: Mr. LeGrand told me that.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told them that Branca has an account that this money goes to, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And Mr. LeGrand told you he was scared of Branca because he knew a lot about what Branca was doing with Michael Jackson's money, correct?
Ann Kite: I don't remember that I phrased it that way.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you phrase it, if you know?
Ann Kite: I just remember saying that Mr. LeGrand was afraid of Mr. Branca.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. LeGrand tell you he was suspicious of what Mr. Branca was doing with Mr. Jackson's money?
Ann Kite: I don't remember him using the word "suspicious." I don't remember specifically what he said about it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But based upon your conversations with LeGrand, you formed the conclusion that LeGrand was suspicious of what Branca was doing with Mr. Jackson's affairs, true?
Ann Kite: I can't answer that, because I can't speak to what was in David's mind. I don't have -- you know, I don't know how I could form an opinion at that point.
Mr. Mesereau: But you told the sheriffs that LeGrand told you that he was physically afraid of Branca, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that Mr. LeGrand would refer to Al Malnik as "Uncle Al," correct?
Ann Kite: That's correct, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he tell you he was afraid of Uncle Al?
Ann Kite: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Didn't you tell the Santa Barbara sheriffs that Mr. LeGrand told you, "Mr. Malnik has connections, and I don't want to see anyone end up dead in an alley"?
Ann Kite: He didn't say it in that context, sir. Not at all.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I'm not asking you in what context he said it, but didn't you tell the sheriffs that LeGrand told you that?
Ann Kite: I did not make a statement like that, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you the report?
Ann Kite: You can show me the report, and I know what you're referring to, and I did not make a statement like that.
Mr. Mesereau: You were misquoted, do you think?
Ann Kite: I think so, yes. I know exactly what that statement was referring to.
Mr. Mesereau: Just correct me if I'm wrong. You didn't tell the Santa Barbara sheriffs that LeGrand told you words to the effect, "I know Malnik has some connections and I don't want to see anyone end up dead in an alley"?
Ann Kite: You're taking it totally out of context. No. Mr. -- Mr. LeGrand never said anything to me or words to those effect, using it the way you are in the statement, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs words to the effect that you thought Konitzer and Schaffel and others were conspiring against Michael Jackson, correct?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; foundation. Also requires hearsay to form that opinion.
The Court: The objection's overruled. You may answer.
Ann Kite: I don't believe I said words to the effect that I believe they were conspiring against Mr. Jackson. What I did say was that I believed that their actions were not beneficial to Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: But you certainly discussed with Mr. LeGrand Mr. LeGrand's concern about what these individuals were doing to Mr. Jackson, correct?
Ann Kite: It was my concern about the way that Mr. Jackson's public relations image was being handled, and I took that concern continuously to Mr. LeGrand.
Mr. Mesereau: But I'm not asking you about that. You and Mr. LeGrand repeatedly discussed his concerns and your concerns that these characters were taking advantage of Mr. Jackson, correct?
Ann Kite: My concerns, which David told me several times that I was overreacting, until I continued to press him on it, and he began the investigation.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Thank you. You told the sheriffs that Konitzer told you Michael Jackson hadn't seen Mr. Schaffel for months, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that Konitzer said, "Schaffel's a good guy"; is that right?
Ann Kite: That statement is in the report, but it wasn't Mr. Konitzer that said that about Mr. Schaffel.
Mr. Mesereau: He never said that to you?
Ann Kite: Not to my recollection.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you told the sheriffs you felt that Konitzer, Weizner and Schaffel manipulated Mr. Jackson to get whatever they wanted, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Calls for a conclusion; speculation.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: I don't believe I said they manipulated Mr. Jackson. I believe I said they manipulated the situation.
Mr. Mesereau: But the situation had everything to do with Mr. Jackson's welfare, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You told them Mr. LeGrand would continually talk to you about what was occurring with Michael Jackson and seek your advice?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And did he do that?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: You complained about Al Malnik, correct?
Ann Kite: I complained about -- well, I don't know if "complained" is the right word. But I told Mr. LeGrand that I was afraid that a high-profile public association with Mr. Malnik, compounded with everything else that Mr. Jackson had going on, would be very detrimental to him, yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you discuss with Mr. LeGrand that Al Malnik had connections with Sony?
Ann Kite: I don't remember ever discussing that with Mr. LeGrand.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you and Mr. LeGrand ever discuss Al Malnik's connection to the catalog?
Ann Kite: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you indicated to the sheriffs, and I believe you testified today that Mr. Geragos wanted you to sign a private investigator's nondisclosure, correct?
Ann Kite: That's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And was it your understanding that he wanted to call you a private investigator?
Ann Kite: I had no understanding. I can just tell you what he said to me. That's all.
Mr. Mesereau: But, I mean, was your reaction to this, "He's trying to make me look like a private investigator so everything is confidential"? Is that the idea?
Ann Kite: Um --
Mr. Mesereau: Is that what you thought? Let me rephrase the question. It's an awkward question. I gather Mr. Geragos told you he wanted you to sign this form, true?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And your understanding was it was a nondisclosure form, right?
Ann Kite: I -- I don't think "nondisclosure" would cover it. I think it was ratcheted up -- you know, a step up from a nondisclosure.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, correct me if I'm wrong, you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that Mr. Geragos wanted to bring you in under a private investigator's nondisclosure. Does that sound right?
Ann Kite: Yeah. I don't remember using the word "nondisclosure," but, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when he talked to you about this, was it your belief that he wanted you to sign something that pledged you to confidentiality?
Ann Kite: It sounded to me like it was pledging me to more than confidentiality.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, and it was going to be under the guise that you were somehow an investigator, right?
Ann Kite: I don't know what it would be under the guise of. I just --
Mr. Mesereau: Well, let me just ask you this: What did he tell you about that?
Ann Kite: He said to me exactly what I said. He asked me to stay in town overnight. He wanted me to come into the office the next day. He wanted me to sign the private investigator's agreement, and then he would fill me in on everything that was going on.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you didn't feel good about that, right?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Something seemed wrong with that?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, it did.
Mr. Mesereau: Because you're not a private investigator, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't like the idea you'd sign something that said you were something you're not, right?
Ann Kite: That was part of it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You also didn't want to be "gagged," as you used the word with the sheriffs, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You wanted to be free to discuss your work with anyone you wanted?
Ann Kite: No, that's not true. I put together the situation that happened the day before with Marc Schaffel calling me about Janet Arvizo. 24 hours later, Mr. Geragos is telling me that -- after I had already spoken to Ronald and asked him about the situation, spoken to David, and David said he couldn't talk to me about it right now. Then Mr. Geragos is asking me to stick around 24 more hours and come in and sign something and he would talk to me. I didn't know what it meant. But obviously I wasn't -- obviously I didn't go around talking to the press about it, because it didn't get out, so....
Mr. Mesereau: Actually, you had signed an agreement at some point to be a public relations person with the team, didn't you?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: That actually had a confidentiality clause, didn't it?
Ann Kite: I don't believe it did, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't have any?
Ann Kite: No.
Mr. Mesereau: So when you signed an agreement, you thought you were free to say whatever you wanted that you heard from that team?
Ann Kite: I did not have a confidentiality agreement in that agreement. But that didn't mean I was seeking to actively breach a confidence.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you talked in your direct examination about an agreement.
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you signed a consulting agreement, didn't you?
Ann Kite: Yes, I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And you probably sign them in your work quite often, true?
Ann Kite: Yes, I do. But I remember looking at this one at Mr. LeGrand's office and there wasn't anything in there about confidentiality, in that agreement.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you have further discussions with Mr. Geragos?
Ann Kite: After that day?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you don't know how often Mr. Geragos spoke to Mr. Jackson, do you?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: So if Mr. Geragos hardly ever saw Mr. Jackson or talked to him, you wouldn't know one way or the other, right?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I wouldn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Geragos told you, "I want to see if I can keep you on the team," didn't he?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did that discussion happen?
Ann Kite: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Mr. Jackson you were concerned about Konitzer, Weizner, and Schaffel, right?
Ann Kite: Again, I wouldn't have said Dieter's name. But, yes, I believe I told him that.
Mr. Mesereau: As I think you know in this report --
Ann Kite: I understand it says that. I know. I just want to make sure that you know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you told Mr. Geragos you were concerned about what Konitzer and Schaffel were doing, right?
Ann Kite: I believe so, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you arranged to meet with Mr. Geragos on some future dates, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And they never happened, right?
Ann Kite: No, they did not.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, why did they get cancelled?
Ann Kite: Mr. Geragos told me that he was in court.
Mr. Mesereau: Any other reasons?
Ann Kite: Not to my knowledge, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you tell the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you quit pursuing a meeting with Mr. Geragos because there were more things that LeGrand was telling you and you had more distrust for Mr. Geragos?
Ann Kite: That's correct. I thought you were asking me about on Mr. Geragos's part why they didn't happen. Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And your understanding was that Mr. LeGrand didn't trust Mr. Geragos, correct?
Ann Kite: That's what he told me, yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And one of the reasons he told you he didn't trust Mr. Geragos was he thought Mr. Geragos was tight with Mr. Malnik, true?
Ann Kite: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, he told you that he thought Mr. Geragos was being paid by Al Malnik, correct?
Ann Kite: But that was after. You're taking two instances and juxtaposing them.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Bailiff: Mr. Mesereau, is your microphone on?
Mr. Mesereau: I haven't looked.
The Court: Oh, has he been talking? (Laughter.)
The Bailiff: We'll fix it at the break.
Mr. Mesereau: We'll start again, Your Honor. (Laughter.)
The Court: Did you hear that? Screams of protest from the jury.
Mr. Mesereau: Doesn't work at all.
The Bailiff: Do you want me to fix it now or wait till the break?
The Court: Actually, he's heard quite well, I think. Do people in the back hear him?
A Voice From The Audience: No.
The Court: You should signal if you can't hear.
A Voice From The Audience: We did; we have.
The Bailiff: They have been, and I turned the air conditioner off.
The Court: You've been working on it, okay. (Discussion off the record.)
The Court: Why don't you call.
The Bailiff: I did call.
Bailiff Narron: She did. I thought in the meantime they could use that one.
The Court: Why don't you say something so we can see if they can hear you in the back.
Mr. Mesereau: "Hello; hello."
A Voice From The Audience: Very good.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
Mr. Mesereau: Ms. Kite, you told the sheriffs that, from the outside looking in, your opinion was that Michael Jackson did not know the things that Konitzer and the team were doing around them, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; requires speculation. She's never met Michael Jackson. There's no way she could have knowledge of what Mr. Jackson knows.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct. I said that.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, did you say before that you had never issued any press releases while you worked for the team?
Ann Kite: I wrote a press release, but I don't believe it ever went out on the wires.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Didn't you tell the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you personally wrote various press releases that went out and got the approval from Schaffel?
Ann Kite: I don't believe -- I wrote press releases and I sent them to Marc Schaffel for approval, but they did not go out.
Mr. Mesereau: None of them went out?
Ann Kite: No. Not to my knowledge, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell the police that some went out?
Ann Kite: I don't believe that I said that they went out or they didn't. I remember saying that I wrote the releases and I got -- you know, sent them to Marc Schaffel for approval.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you the report?
Ann Kite: You can show me the report, but I don't -- if that's what it says, I don't remember saying that they did or didn't. I distinctly remember writing the releases and sending them to Mr. Schaffel for approval, and Mr. Konitzer.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs you don't think Michael Jackson even knew about these releases, correct?
Ann Kite: That's correct, yes, I did.
The Court: Just a moment. (To a sound technician) Why don't you just wait till the break. And then you'll be better able to -- 15 minutes. Go ahead.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh. I thought we were taking a break. Excuse me, Your Honor.
The Court: No, I wanted -- I didn't want him to try and fix that while you were trying to ask questions. We have sound right now, so --
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know someone named Jermaine Jackson?
Ann Kite: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Who is Jermaine Jackson?
Ann Kite: Jermaine is Michael's brother.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know him personally?
Ann Kite: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: How do you know him personally?
Ann Kite: I met with him.
Mr. Mesereau: Approximately when was that?
Ann Kite: I believe in April of 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you arrange that meeting?
Ann Kite: Mr. Jackson and I, Jermaine Jackson and I, spoke on the phone and arranged it together, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you call him?
Ann Kite: He called me initially.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know how he got your number?
Ann Kite: Yes, from Rita Cosby at FOX.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you meet with Jermaine?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did you meet with him?
Ann Kite: At his home in Encino, California.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Jermaine Jackson that Al Malnik and other people pretended to be Michael's friends, but were not, true?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Ann Kite: I don't remember saying that to Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: You met with Jermaine Jackson for approximately six or seven hours, right?
Ann Kite: For several hours, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs about that meeting, true?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct. I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And you mentioned Al Malnik, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: You mentioned Konitzer, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: You mentioned Geragos, correct?
Ann Kite: I don't remember if I mentioned Geragos. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: You mentioned Schaffel, didn't you?
Ann Kite: Yes, absolutely I did.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Jermaine Jackson, "These people are not your brother Michael's friends," right?
Ann Kite: I don't remember that those were my exact words.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you the report?
Ann Kite: Sure you can.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Ann Kite: That's not what it says. It says I told you about him and other people that were not Michael Jackson's friends, but it doesn't say -- it doesn't quote me as saying that --
The Court: Wait. When he shows you to refresh your memory, just look at it, and then you can tell him whether or not it does refresh your memory.
Ann Kite: Okay. Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that police report?
Ann Kite: Yes, I have.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you tell Jermaine about Al Malnik and other people that were Michael Jackson's friends but were really not?
Ann Kite: I did not say it in those terms. I told Mr. Jermaine Jackson about people that were associated with Mr. Jackson, but I don't -- and I did not say and it does not quote me in there as saying that these people were Mr. Jackson's friends but were really not. That's not what it quotes me as saying.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, I want to ask you if this is a correct quote: "Gabriel said she told Jermaine Jackson about Al Malnik and other people that were Michael Jackson's friends but were really not." Did you say anything to that effect?
Ann Kite: That is not a direct quote from me. That's not how it reads.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you say words to that effect?
Ann Kite: I told Mr. Jermaine Jackson about people that were associated with Mr. -- with Mr. Michael Jackson that I felt were detrimental to him. But I don't believe I ever said they were pretending to be his friend, but they're really not.
Mr. Mesereau: So these words are wrong that I just read you?
Ann Kite: The exact word using them as a quote is wrong, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Yes. Now, Mr. Jackson's mother was at the meeting, correct?
Ann Kite: Mr. Jackson's mother was at the house.
Mr. Mesereau: Was she at the meeting?
Ann Kite: No, she wasn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever speak to her that day?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And how long did you speak to her?
Ann Kite: Just for a minute or two.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. Jermaine Jackson introduce you to Michael's mother?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did. And to his wife also.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Is it true the meeting went six or seven hours?
Ann Kite: I was there for about six hours, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs Jermaine was in a complete state of denial about the people around Michael Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: That's what I felt, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told Jermaine words to the effect, "These people are taking advantage of Michael Jackson," true?
Ann Kite: I told Jermaine Jackson that I believed, especially Marc Schaffel and his continued association with Mr. Michael Jackson, was going to be very detrimental to him, yes. And Mr. Jackson told me that his brother didn't associate with those type of people.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told Jermaine Jackson you thought Michael needed to be around his family and away from these people, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And you felt frustrated that you weren't getting through to Jermaine about your concerns, right?
Ann Kite: I don't believe "frustrated" would -- I felt sad.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs you thought that Michael Jackson's lawyers would just shut you up if you complained to them, correct?
Ann Kite: I told them that I didn't believe it would do me any good to talk to Mr. Jackson's lawyers about what was going on, because they wouldn't want to hear anything I had to say, yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you say "Michael Jackson's lawyers," are you talking about Mr. Geragos?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you talking about Mr. LeGrand?
Ann Kite: No. I mean, David always listened to what I had to say, so, no.
Mr. Mesereau: How long after this meeting with Jermaine Jackson did you learn that Mr. LeGrand had started a private investigation of whether or not these people were defrauding Michael Jackson?
Ann Kite: The investigation was started before the meeting with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did you discuss that investigation with David LeGrand.
Ann Kite: The investigation that he started?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: As it was ongoing?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: Not to my knowledge, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he tell you that he had suspicions that these people were stealing from Michael Jackson at some point?
Ann Kite: He told me that he had called the accountants and got them to give him some information without Mr. Konitzer's knowledge, and that's how he figured out that there was an amount of money missing.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But at some point did he say to you words to the effect, "I'm hiring a top-flight investigative firm to investigate all of these people, because I think they're stealing from Michael Jackson"?
Ann Kite: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: No, he did not. We were on the phone. And he told me to call his managing partner and ask him to begin an investigation into these people.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Ann Kite: And I sent an e-mail to the managing partner and said, "David asked me to e-mail -- to contact you and," you know, "begin an investigation."
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Now, you considered going to the police to tell them what was being done to Mr. Jackson, didn't you?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you didn't go to the tabloids or the police to tell them your story, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: But you had considered it, right?
Ann Kite: Oh, no. I had no information or hard knowledge to go to the police with. And I certainly would never go to the tabloids with a story.
Mr. Mesereau: When you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs you were concerned about what these people were doing to Michael Jackson, you also mentioned the names Frank and Vinnie, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, I believe I mentioned the names.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told them you had heard Frank and Vinnie were involved with these individuals who you thought were defrauding Michael Jackson, correct?
Ann Kite: No, I said I had heard the names. But I don't -- don't remember specifically commenting on the capacity of their involvement with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the police you had no further information on Frank and Vinnie?
Ann Kite: That's correct, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: You also told the sheriffs that Stuart Backerman was brought in by Konitzer and you thought he would do anything Konitzer wanted, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: So clearly, you thought Mr. Backerman was harming Mr. Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you think he was dishonest?
Ann Kite: I -- I believed that anyone who would put out a press release on himself above serving the press interests of Mr. Jackson at a critical time was just not someone who would serve Mr. Jackson in the capacity that he deserved.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I guess it goes without saying, you thought that Mr. Backerman's public relations efforts were harming Mr. Jackson; does that make sense?
Ann Kite: I didn't believe they were helping Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You felt he was putting his personal interests ahead of his client Michael Jackson?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever tell that to Backerman directly?
Ann Kite: No, sir. I did -- Stuart and I had a conversation a few days earlier. He was extremely upset because someone had quoted -- used my name in a newspaper and quoted me as being Mr. Jackson's spokesperson. And he called me to yell at me about that. And I told him that this was not the time to nitpick about stuff like that; that I never asked to be called Mr. Jackson's official spokesperson. And that when the fire was burning, it was time to roll up the sleeves and pitch in and not worry about such petty things.
Mr. Mesereau: When you met with Jermaine Jackson, Michael's brother, at the home, how long after you had been terminated did this happen?
Ann Kite: Several weeks. Maybe six weeks. I don't remember. Four weeks. Somewhere around there.
Mr. Mesereau: So it was pretty close to the time that you were terminated?
Ann Kite: Yes, uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: But in this six-day period that you were working with this team, you appear to have obtained an awful lot of information about the team, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Your information came a lot -- excuse me. Your information about this team came from many discussions with David LeGrand, true?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And those discussions preceded your joining the team, right?
Ann Kite: Not -- David didn't really discuss information with me about the team per se before I joined the team. So I had no preconceived notions when I joined the team.
Mr. Mesereau: After you left the team, you continued your discussions with David LeGrand, true?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: About the team, right?
Ann Kite: In a manner of speaking, but not specifically.
Mr. Mesereau: After you left the team, were you and LeGrand still close friends?
Ann Kite: Yes, we were.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you're close friends today, correct?
Ann Kite: No, we're not.
Mr. Mesereau: You're not close friends at all?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you antagonists?
Ann Kite: No, I wouldn't -- no.
Mr. Mesereau: How would you describe your relationship? Just not a friendly one now?
Ann Kite: The last time that David called me was the day that the Santa Barbara Police came to interview me. And he left me a message and I didn't call him back. I didn't return the call. And -- because I didn't -- I didn't want to be put into -- in a bad position.
Mr. Mesereau: Did the Santa Barbara sheriffs tell you not to speak to anybody about the interview?
Ann Kite: Not to speak with anybody at all?
Mr. Mesereau: About your interview, yes.
Ann Kite: No, I don't remember that they said that to me, no. No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So correct me if I'm wrong, he tried to reach you on March 11th, 2004, and you didn't return the call, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you haven't talked to him since, right?
Ann Kite: No, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you still do any public relations work for his firm or him?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: When did your public relations work for him stop?
Ann Kite: Visibly, I would say probably sometime around the beginning of April. But throughout the summer and, you know, even up to around the time of the raid of the ranch, he would send me e-mails and ask me to check things out for him, or I would send him articles.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that Backerman was more concerned with his own public relations than taking care of Michael Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And you still believe that, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, did Backerman ask you to help him with his own press release about what a great guy he was?
Ann Kite: Oh, God, no, he didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see that -- did you see that press release by surprise, or how did you learn about it?
Ann Kite: I saw it in the newspaper, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Was this during the six days you worked for Michael?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, it was. I believe it was the 13th of February.
Mr. Mesereau: And was it announcing that Mr. Backerman will be doing PR for Michael Jackson?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, it was.
Mr. Mesereau: And you don't know if Backerman's ever met Michael Jackson, do you?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Certainly in any discussions you had with Mr. Backerman, Michael wasn't there, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct. If he was, I think he would have been very upset.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you told the police that Backerman was upset that there was an article about you in the New York Times saying that you represented Michael, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct. It wasn't an article. It was a quote. I had received an overflow, what we called an overflow call from a reporter who was looking for a quote on a story that he was going to run. I did not identify myself to that reporter as his spokesperson, and -- but when the report was printed, that's how it quoted me. And Mr. Backerman was extremely, extremely annoyed about that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. What did he say to you?
Ann Kite: He said, "How could you go around telling people that you're Mr. Jackson's spokesperson? I'm his official spokesperson, not you."
Mr. Mesereau: And what was your response?
Ann Kite: I won't give you my verbatim response. But my response basically was, "Stuart, it was a call that I took. I never told anyone that I am Mr. Jackson's official spokesperson. This -- our client is in severe trouble and this is not the time to be wasting an hour or so on the phone arguing about something so petty as this."
Mr. Mesereau: And did you tell the sheriffs where Backerman was staying at that point in time?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did you tell the Santa Barbara sheriffs that Backerman was staying?
Ann Kite: At Mr. Schaffel's house.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you learn that?
Ann Kite: From Mr. Backerman and from David LeGrand.
Mr. Mesereau: You've indicated that you thought Schaffel -- excuse me, not "you thought." You were told Schaffel's in charge of public relations at one point, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Backerman told you he's in charge of public relations at one point, didn't he?
Ann Kite: No, Backerman never said he was in charge of public relations.
Mr. Mesereau: What did he say his role was?
Ann Kite: He was Mr. Jackson's official spokesperson.
Mr. Mesereau: And he told you that he was Mr. Jackson's official spokesperson while living at Mr. Schaffel's place; is that correct?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And, of course, you don't know if -- if Backerman even cleared anything ever with Michael Jackson. You don't know?
Ann Kite: I have no idea if Mr. Backerman ever spoke with Mr. Jackson, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Your suspicion was he was issuing press releases without Mr. Jackson even knowing about it, right?
Ann Kite: Stuart never, to my knowledge, during the time I was there, issued a press release either. No releases except for Bell Yard's went out at that time.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you told the sheriffs that you didn't think Konitzer even filled in Backerman about all the information he had?
Ann Kite: That's correct. Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: So you thought Backerman was being left in the dark about what Konitzer was doing, right?
Ann Kite: I believed that there was an intense lack of communication among the team that could have worked to Mr. Jackson's benefit to help quench some of the fires.
Mr. Mesereau: So what you wanted was a better team, a team with more integrity, correct?
Ann Kite: What I wanted was a team that would be extremely proactive on Mr. Jackson's benefit.
Mr. Mesereau: And you felt this team was putting their own interests ahead of Mr. Jackson's?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
The Court: Let's take our break.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Counsel?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Ms. Kite, you told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that you have no personal knowledge of anything Michael Jackson has done, correct?
Ann Kite: That's correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told them you had no personal knowledge that any molestation ever took place with Michael Jackson, correct?
Ann Kite: That's correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You also told them you had no personal knowledge about Janet Arvizo ever being kidnapped, correct?
Ann Kite: Other than what I heard from Marc Schaffel and my own feelings.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the police that you may be wrong, you may have overreacted, and maybe there was no kidnapping, right?
Ann Kite: That was always a possibility, but that's not what I believed.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you told the police that, in your mind, maybe you're wrong; maybe you overreacted; maybe there was no kidnapping at all, right?
Ann Kite: That's what I said, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. For obvious reasons. You weren't there.
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told them you can't imagine what it's like to be in a cage and watched all the time, right?
Ann Kite: That's correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the sheriffs that you were on the phone with LeGrand and Schaffel when NBC was negotiating for footage regarding the rebuttal tape, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's the footage that eventually went to FOX, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: That's the footage that was produced in response to the Bashir documentary, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said that LeGrand issued a statement to the press that Geragos ordered to make NBC look bad, right?
Ann Kite: No, that's not what I said. That's -- that's not what I said. If you'd like me to explain that incident to you, I'd be glad to.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that wrong, what I just said? I'm just looking at the report. Is that wrong?
Ann Kite: You're taking it out of context. Yes, it's wrong.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you the paragraph?
Ann Kite: You can show me the paragraph. I know what it's referring to, and it's a summary of what I said, and it's not correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I didn't summarize it.
Ann Kite: That's okay. I'm just letting you know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Did you complain that Mr. Geragos wanted to make NBC look bad?
Ann Kite: No. I didn't say anything about Mr. Geragos trying to make NBC look bad, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know where the sheriffs got that remark?
Ann Kite: I said it about Mr. Schaffel, not about Mr. Geragos.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Ann Kite: And Mr. Geragos gave the okay to release the information.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you tell the sheriffs that Mr. Geragos gave the okay to release information that was damaging to NBC?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And correct me if I'm wrong, I think what you're saying is that Schaffel prepared that information, right?
Ann Kite: What I'm saying is that Schaffel spoke with Mr. Geragos and Mr. LeGrand and pushed for the information to be released.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you object to releasing that information?
Ann Kite: I didn't know about it when it happened. But when I found out, I objected vigorously, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that because you didn't want to make NBC look bad?
Ann Kite: It was because I felt it was bad precedent, period.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was it your understanding that Schaffel and Mr. Geragos were trying to make NBC look bad?
Ann Kite: It was my understanding that Mr. Schaffel in particular was trying to make NBC look bad.
Mr. Mesereau: But you thought Mr. Geragos had okayed it?
Ann Kite: David LeGrand told me that the okay came from Mr. Geragos.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you said you wanted to publicly exonerate NBC and CBS, true?
Ann Kite: I remember saying NBC, but I don't remember saying CBS.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You wanted to somehow make up for the fact that NBC ended up looking bad?
Ann Kite: No, I didn't want to make up for it. I felt terrible for the fallout that NBC received based on the memo that Mr. Schaffel arranged to have released. It wasn't right and it wasn't fair.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did Schaffel tell you why he wanted to do this?
Ann Kite: I knew why he wanted to do it. He didn't have to tell me.
Mr. Mesereau: What did he tell you about it?
Ann Kite: Well, he was upset because NBC was producing another special about Mr. Jackson and they were referring to Mr. Schaffel's past.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. And Mr. Schaffel also was upset that he wasn't getting any profit from that show, correct?
Ann Kite: I don't know if he would have gotten profits from the NBC show or not. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. Did you believe Mr. Backerman was involved in that effort?
Ann Kite: In what effort?
Mr. Mesereau: The effort by Schaffel and Geragos.
Ann Kite: To NBC?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: To release that memo?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ann Kite: No, I don't believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, at some point you told the sheriffs that Geragos brought in another PR firm; is that right?
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Who was that?
Ann Kite: Eric Dezenhall.
Mr. Mesereau: From Washington D.C.?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever speak to him?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you last speak to him?
Ann Kite: Probably in April of that same year, 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you speak to him about the work he was going to do?
Ann Kite: I spoke to him -- David had asked me to speak to him about several different things.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you complained that Mr. Dezenhall told you that Mr. Jackson is not socially relevant?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did say that.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were upset that a public relations spokesperson would ever say that about a client, right?
Ann Kite: Yes, I was.
Mr. Mesereau: You were particularly upset that he would say that about his new client, Michael Jackson, right?
Ann Kite: I was upset because I didn't believe, no matter what, that there would ever come a time that Mr. Jackson wasn't socially relevant.
Mr. Mesereau: And you don't know if Mr. Dezenhall ever met or spoke to Mr. Jackson, do you?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Your understanding is simply that Mr. Geragos hired him?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You complained that Mr. Dezenhall shouldn't make a statement like that about Mr. Jackson, true?
Ann Kite: I don't know that I complained, but I -- I would never make a statement about that about a client of mine, no matter what.
Mr. Mesereau: You accused him of doing nothing and saying nothing, right?
Ann Kite: I didn't accuse him. I believed that he would be a very good fit for the team because he had the same hunker-down philosophy, the same philosophy of "Don't say anything. Don't put anything out. It doesn't matter what bad press is out there, we can't refute it. We're already behind the eightball."
Mr. Mesereau: Did you complain that you thought Mr. Dezenhall was throwing his client to the wolves?
Ann Kite: I don't remember saying that about Mr. Dezenhall.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you use words to that effect?
Ann Kite: I believe I said "the team," or I felt that basically that's what the team was doing to Mr. Jackson by not being proactive and responding for him in the press.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You complained that Mr. Konitzer wanted to build a website called "MJJ Invincible," right?
Ann Kite: I didn't complain. I stated that when I was hired, Mr. Konitzer asked to put up a website, and the URL that he wanted to use was "MJJ Invincible." And I told him I thought that was highly inappropriate, given the backlash that was out there with all of the -- with the Bashir documentary and everything else going on. I didn't believe that Mr. Jackson should put himself in that position to be subject to more ridicule from the press by having a website domain of that name.
Mr. Mesereau: But you don't know if Mr. Jackson even knew about this idea, right?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: You said Konitzer was "out of his mind," right?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did. I did.
Mr. Mesereau: You said, "That's the last thing they should do," correct?
Ann Kite: That's absolutely what I said.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You thought that Mr. Schaffel was saying things to the press to get himself back in Michael Jackson's good graces, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Because you knew that Mr. Schaffel was not in Michael Jackson's -- Michael Jackson's good graces, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; requires speculation as to what she knew about Mr. Jackson's intent or knowledge.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did someone tell you that Marc Schaffel was not in Michael Jackson's good graces?
Ann Kite: No one told me that specifically.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, but you did tell the sheriffs you thought Schaffel was trying to get back into his good graces, true?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the Santa Barbara sheriffs that Michael Jackson has a lot of talent but never matured past the age of 12, right?
Ann Kite: I didn't say it that way, no, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You said something to that effect, didn't you?
Ann Kite: No, what I said to him -- to the sheriffs, when they spoke to me, was that I felt that Mr. Jackson was very talented, extremely talented, but the way that he was portrayed was that he hadn't matured past the age of 12.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And clearly, you didn't think this team was helping him deal with any of this, did you?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: You thought they were actually hurting him, didn't you?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, clearly you have never personally observed Mr. Jackson do anything wrong --
The Court: Counsel, you've asked that question ten times today. I want you to look at the jury and realize that they're tired of listening to this.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: You know, the -- you need to grasp the evidence and present it, not keep repeating it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Yes, Your Honor. Just a few more questions.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you send the team a series of letters that appeared to have favorable responses to the Bashir documentary by e-mail?
Ann Kite: I don't know what you're referring to.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, did you ever send to -- just one second. May I just take a second, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When you first were retained, you were sending various e-mails to the team, correct?
Ann Kite: Sending and receiving, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were trying to educate the team about responses to the Bashir documentary, correct?
Ann Kite: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember what the subject of those e-mails was?
Ann Kite: I don't remember, sir. I sent a lot of e-mails during that time.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever send an e-mail that basically said -- showed letters where people were saying they thought Mr. Jackson was being exploited in Bashir?
Ann Kite: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember ever discussing that?
Ann Kite: We may have discussed it as a way to attack Mr. Bashir. But I don't remember. I mean, part of the plan was to try to get Mr. Jackson's image rehabilitated. So obviously anything that could show Mr. Bashir had ill intent towards Mr. Jackson would be very helpful to us.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you investigate Mr. Bashir's background yourself?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I didn't have the time.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you plan to do that?
Ann Kite: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you take any measures to do that at all?
Ann Kite: No. Not at the time, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you hire anybody to do that?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know Mr. Bashir?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I do not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. No further questions.
The Court: Thank you.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:
Mr. Auchincloss: Ms. Kite, you mentioned when you were referring to Mr. Dezenhall you had that hunker down approach?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you mean by that?
Ann Kite: Don't say anything to the press. Don't talk. If negative publicity comes out, you just brush it off and move on.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is that an uncommon philosophy in PR?
Ann Kite: I think it's more uncommon, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is it a nonexistent philosophy? I mean, is it very rare, I should say?
Ann Kite: I would think that it would be more rare than common.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Do some PR firms implement that philosophy?
Ann Kite: Yes, they do.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was it evident to you that that was the philosophy of the team?
Ann Kite: Yes, it is. Yes, it was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Including Bell Yard?
Ann Kite: No, not Bell Yard.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Everybody with the exception of Bell Yard?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you have an impression as to whether or not the team thought that was the best way to go about these things, whether or not --
Ann Kite: Whether to hunker down or not?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Ann Kite: My impression was that they didn't want to do anything. They wanted to hunker down, because anything I asked to be able to do on behalf of Mr. Jackson I was told not to.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever develop an impression as to why they wanted to hunker down?
Ann Kite: My impression was that there was obviously something more important than Mr. Jackson's public relations going on.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. You said that you've never met Mr. Jackson.
Ann Kite: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And do you know if anybody from Bell Yard, that you dealt with, ever met Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: Not to my knowledge.
Mr. Auchincloss: And Mr. Backerman, you said, never met Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: Not to my knowledge.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. There was some -- a statement made to you by Mr. Schaffel concerning Janet selling her story to the tabloids.
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you recall talking about that?
Ann Kite: Uh-huh.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever have any information or knowledge that Janet wanted to sell a story to the tabloids?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever have any information that Janet even had a story to tell the tabloids?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you question anybody about that? "What's this story about?" Did you ever --
Ann Kite: I thought it -- when Mr. Schaffel said that he was afraid she was going to sell her story to the tabloids, my first thought was, "What story?" But I never really questioned anybody about it.
Mr. Auchincloss: You said that one of the witnesses, I believe it was -- well, I can't recall. I believe you stated that Schaffel -- someone told you Schaffel hadn't seen Jackson for a couple of months.
Ann Kite: Yes. Mr. Konitzer told me that in a telephone call.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if that's true?
Ann Kite: I have no direct knowledge of that.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was the context of that conversation?
Ann Kite: I was, again, extremely concerned, because the media was raising questions about Mr. Schaffel's background, and I wanted to be able to answer them. And Mr. Konitzer, I kept telling him, "This is not a good thing to have Mr. Schaffel continuously linked with Mr. Jackson in the press. We need to stop here this." And he told me at that point that Mr. Schaffel hadn't seen Mr. Jackson for a couple of months.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. But you have no idea whether that's true?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know anything about Mr. Schaffel's relationship with Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: Not personally, no.
Mr. Auchincloss: As to how many times he talks to him or sees him or any of that?
Ann Kite: No, I don't.
Mr. Auchincloss: What about Mr. Geragos's relationship with Mr. Jackson? Do you have any knowledge as to how often they talk or dealt with each other during this point?
Ann Kite: No, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Konitzer, same question.
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't. I know that Ronald portrayed to me that he stayed at the ranch, that he talked directly to Michael, but I couldn't tell you if that's true or not.
Mr. Auchincloss: No personal knowledge. What about Mr. LeGrand? Did he tell you whether or not he talked with Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did he say about that?
Ann Kite: Told me that he had talked to Mr. Jackson; that he met him in Miami when he went to do the power of attorney; that he went to Neverland to be there on a day that they were supposed to tape a special with CBS that got cancelled. And I don't remember the times after that, but I know there were other times after that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. LeGrand have Mr. Jackson's phone number; do you know?
Ann Kite: I'm sure he did. I never asked him.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. LeGrand -- you stated that Mr. LeGrand expressed some concerns to you about these people that were around Mr. Jackson. Did Mr. LeGrand ever express those concerns to Mr. Jackson, according to Mr. LeGrand?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did.
Mr. Auchincloss: So he told you he did talk to Mr. Jackson about it?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And informed him of the problems?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: When did this happen?
Ann Kite: In March. Mid March.
Mr. Auchincloss: You said that Mr. Konitzer had a power of attorney at some point?
Ann Kite: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And do you know anything about the power of attorney?
Ann Kite: The only thing that I know is David told me that it could be overridden at any time by the client and that it required two signatures.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So, two signatures; what does that mean?
Ann Kite: I don't know. That's just what he said.
Mr. Auchincloss: So the power of attorney required two signatures. Could you tell whether or not he was talking about actions taken under the power of attorney or the power of attorney itself?
Ann Kite: I couldn't tell you.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. The FOX special. First of all, who is Fire Mountain? You testified briefly about Fire Mountain.
Ann Kite: Fire Mountain is a corporation that David set up in Las Vegas.
Mr. Auchincloss: And who are the parties, the principals in that corporation?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: There was this NBC memo that Mr. Schaffel was upset about. Do you know what that was all about?
Ann Kite: What the memo was about?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Ann Kite: Yes, the memo was --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: You said that the FOX rebuttal program produced -- or there was a contract for that program to produce $3 million, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And you also said you believed some of that money went to Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: Yes, I believe that.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you base that on?
Ann Kite: I just -- I guess based on what David said and -- I mean, I never saw money actually transferred into Mr. Jackson's hands, so --
Mr. Auchincloss: Did this transaction take place while you were working as a PR person?
Ann Kite: Yes, it did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you upset about it?
Ann Kite: Yes, I was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why?
Ann Kite: Because I said that I didn't believe that Mr. Jackson should have to sell the proof of his innocence.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was that a PR move on your behalf?
Ann Kite: Yes, absolutely.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you express your concern to anybody?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: To whom?
Ann Kite: To Mr. LeGrand. To Mr. Schaffel. To Mr. Konitzer. To Bell Yard.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know why they didn't take your advice?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; calls for speculation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did they tell you why they wanted money for this?
Ann Kite: Yes, they did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did they say?
Ann Kite: Because there was no money.
Mr. Auchincloss: What do you mean?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; the Court's ruling.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there any information -- you mentioned a number of fires burning, right? What did you mean by that?
Ann Kite: Attacks on Mr. Jackson in the press.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Were there any attacks on Mr. Jackson in the press concerning finances --
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- his finances?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; the Court's ruling.
Mr. Auchincloss: I believe this door has been opened.
Mr. Mesereau: I don't think it has, Your Honor.
The Court: The question, as presented, I'll allow, and the answer that was given. "Were there any attacks on Mr. Jackson in the press concerning finances? "Answer: Yes." That's as far as you can go at this time on that subject.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who did Mr. LeGrand -- he was an attorney. Who was he an attorney for?
Ann Kite: Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Anybody else, as far as you know? I mean, in this relationship with Mr. Jackson, was he an attorney for a corporation of Mr. Jackson's, or any other entity involving Mr. Jackson?
Ann Kite: I don't know. I don't know.
Mr. Auchincloss: And as an attorney, who did he report to, as Mr. Jackson's attorney?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: If you know; if you've been told.
The Court: Just a moment. I'm not quite sure what the question was. I'll sustain the objection.
Mr. Auchincloss: You mentioned that the power of attorney at some point was revoked?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: You were I believe referring to the power of attorney for Mr. Konitzer?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know when that was?
Ann Kite: In mid March of 2003. I believe it was sometime around the 12th of March.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if that terminated Mr. Konitzer as an employee or from working for Mr. Jackson?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: Your Honor, she was asked a portion of statements.
The Court: That's true.
Mr. Auchincloss: This is the full statement.
The Court: You're correct. I understand that. Just let me --
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you.
The Court: All right. The foundation objection is sustained. But do you want the question read back so you know what I'm ruling on?
Mr. Auchincloss: Sure. Thank you.
The Court Reporter: Do you know if that terminated Mr. Konitzer as an employee or from working for Mr. Jackson?
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. I'll rephrase the question.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you learn from anybody that Mr. Konitzer was continuing to work for Mr. Jackson after the power of attorney was revoked?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: It's establishing the foundation. It's a yes or no question.
The Court: Well, it calls for hearsay, too. It's a little more complicated than that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, I can limit it some more.
The Court: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you learned that -- well, let me back up. When did you learn that the power of attorney was revoked?
Ann Kite: Around the 12th of March.
Mr. Auchincloss: From?
Ann Kite: David LeGrand.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And do you know whether or not that power of attorney, when it was revoked, terminated Mr. Konitzer's employment by Mr. Jackson --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- based upon these conversations with Mr. LeGrand?
Mr. Mesereau: Foundation and hearsay.
The Court: All right. I'm going to let you answer that question yes or no. The question is just whether or not you know, not what the result was.
Ann Kite: Yes, I know.
The Court: Then the rest of the foundation would be how does she know that, without telling us the answer.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. How do you know the answer to that question?
Ann Kite: Mr. LeGrand told me.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did Mr. LeGrand tell you?
Ann Kite: He told me that the power of attorney had been terminated; that Ronald didn't have any more control over Michael's finances, but that he was still going to continue to do business with him.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you went and spoke with Jermaine Jackson, can you tell me how that meeting came together?
Ann Kite: I had been speaking with Rita Cosby from FOX. She suggested that I might want to call Jermaine Jackson because he was very concerned about his brother. She gave Mr. Jackson my telephone number. He called me. We spoke. He asked if I'd be willing to come and meet with him. And I told him yes, I would. And I went.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you expressed concern about some of the team members to Mr. Jermaine Jackson?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you express any other concerns about Mr. Jackson to Jermaine at that time?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you tell him?
Ann Kite: I expressed concern about his --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Relevance; 352; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: The full conversation.
The Court: Overruled.
Ann Kite: I expressed concern about Mr. Jackson's financial situation.
Mr. Auchincloss: In what respect?
Ann Kite: Um --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection, Your Honor. The Court's ruling.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. Jermaine Jackson indicate whether or not he was close to his brother during this conversation?
Ann Kite: I don't think he ever said he was close to his brother, but he didn't say he was distant either. He indicated great concern about his brother.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he indicate whether or not he had communications with his brother?
Ann Kite: Yes, he did.
Mr. Auchincloss: You also mentioned that Mr. Konitzer and Mr. Weizner had a history of bad business decisions.
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did you base that on?
Ann Kite: Information from David and information that I'd read in the press.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And as far as these bad business deals that you had read about in the press, can you give me an approximate time frame as to when these things were published?
Ann Kite: No. I'm sorry, I can't. They were -- some of them were before my employment with Mr. Jackson --
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Ann Kite: -- and some of them after.
Mr. Auchincloss: It was published in the press, these bad business dealings?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you, in your dealings with Mr. Schaffel, ever receive any information from him, direct information from him, that he intended to hurt Michael Jackson?
Ann Kite: Never.
Mr. Auchincloss: What about with Mr. Konitzer?
Ann Kite: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Backerman?
Ann Kite: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Geragos?
Ann Kite: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Or Mr. LeGrand?
Ann Kite: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever have any information that they intended him any malice, this group of people? Well, that's compound.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll strike that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Your assessment that they were hurting Michael Jackson, is that based on your professional experience in the public relations field as far as what was going on, or based on something else?
Ann Kite: It was based on what I saw in the public relations side, the lack of action.
Mr. Auchincloss: You felt that the hunker-down approach was all wrong here?
Ann Kite: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Your Honor, there's two areas that I feel are relevant at this point regarding Mr. Schaffel and Mr. Malnik concerning the cross-examination. However, I don't want to go into these areas without the Court's permission.
The Court: All right. Counsel want to approach? (To the jury) That means you can talk. Not only that, you have to talk. (Discussion held off the record at sidebar.)
The Court: All right. Thank you for talking. Counsel, proceed.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you.
Mr. Auchincloss: Ms. Kite, with respect to the public relations problems associated with Mr. Jackson that you've identified, the fires specifically - and I'm talking only about issues that had made their way into the media - was there any negative PR associated with Mr. Jackson specifically regarding Marc Schaffel?
Ann Kite: Yes, there was.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was it?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Auchincloss: You may answer the question.
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, the basis is hearsay; 352.
The Court: The hearsay objection's overruled. The 352, again, if you're talking about undue use of time, it's overruled. This is more evidence, though, it's more evidence that isn't being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. The witness has testified that she was trying to help put out fires - for lack of a better word, I'll use that word - concerning Mr. Jackson, and then there was some cross-examination. And I've now agreed to let the attorney cover two more areas that she might -- or she'll testify. We'll see what she testifies to about those things.
Mr. Mesereau: We object on foundation also, Your Honor.
The Court: Huh?
Mr. Mesereau: We object on foundation also.
The Court: All right. Go ahead.
Mr. Auchincloss: So I think you previously testified you researched the Internet, you researched the news services, television, et cetera, correct?
Ann Kite: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Based on that, what specific problem did you identify involving Mr. Jackson's association with Marc Schaffel?
Mr. Mesereau: Vague as to time, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll be specific.
Mr. Auchincloss: As to during this month of February in 2003.
Ann Kite: David told me, and I discovered, that Mr. Schaffel -- am I allowed to say?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Let's focus specifically on what came out in the media during that month.
Ann Kite: What came out in the media during that month was that Mr. Schaffel was a gay pornography producer.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. And let's move on to the -- and did you perceive that as a negative public relations association?
Ann Kite: With respect to Mr. Jackson, yes, absolutely.
Mr. Auchincloss: Let's move on to Mr. Malnik. Was there any negative -- same question. Based upon all your review of the different news services, was there ever any negative public relations issues presented in the media by virtue of Mr. Jackson's association with Al Malnik?
Ann Kite: Yes, there was.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what was that?
Ann Kite: There were --
Mr. Auchincloss: Speaking about the month of February 2003 again.
Ann Kite: There was articles about Mr. Jackson's association with Mr. Malnik as he was reputed to be a known mobster.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Thank you. I have no further questions.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, sir.
The Court: Any cross?
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Ms. Kite, you have no knowledge whatsoever that Mr. Jackson has ever been involved in anything related to gay pornography production?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: And you have no information of Mr. Jackson himself ever being involved in mobster-type activities?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, you were repeatedly complaining, "You've got to get these people away from Mr. Jackson"?
Ann Kite: Absolutely, I was.
Mr. Mesereau: And you complained they were exploiting him, correct?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Vauge as to who "they" are. Argumentative as to the word "exploiting."
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Ann Kite: Can you read it back? I'm sorry.
The Court: Yes.
The Court Reporter: And you complained they were exploiting him, correct?
The Court: I think the answer came in before the objection, but I overruled the objection.
Mr. Mesereau: And you went to Mr. Jackson's mother's home, and you met with Jermaine and his mother to tell them that these people were taking advantage of Mr. Jackson, and Mr. Jackson appears to be nowhere to be seen, right?
Ann Kite: I went to tell them that I was concerned about the association between these people and Mr. Jackson, yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And you never saw these people with Mr. Jackson, did you?
Ann Kite: No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you. No further questions.
Mr. Auchincloss: Nothing further.
The Court: Thank you. You may step down. Is this witness excused?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, Your Honor.
The Court: You're excused. Call your next witness.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you want to keep going, Your Honor?
The Court: What time --
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, can we make it subject to re-call?
The Court: Excuse me?
Mr. Mesereau: We would like to make the witness subject to re-call.
The Court: All right. You're not permanently excused. You may leave, but you may be recalled. Is that all right?
Ann Kite: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, could we approach for just five, ten seconds?
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: I promise it won't be longer than that. (Off-the-record discussion held at sidebar.)
Mr. Sneddon: Call Al Lafferty, Your Honor.
The Court: Come forward. When you get to the witness stand, remain standing. Raise your right hand. Face the clerk.

Mr. Sneddon: And directing your attention back to November of 2003, okay?
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What were your duties and assignments at that time?
Albert Lafferty: At that time I was assigned to the forensics investigation unit, the criminal investigation division.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you just take a moment and explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what that job with the forensics unit involved?
Albert Lafferty: It was our job to respond to crime scenes, document those scenes, search for evidence, collect and preserve the evidence, and process any evidence which was within our capabilities.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to November 18th of 2003, did you participate on the execution of a search warrant on Mr. Jackson's ranch at Neverland Valley Ranch?
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: And what particular duty assignments were you assigned on that day?
Albert Lafferty: I was assigned to shoot video and photographs of the main residence.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, was there some significance attached to the manner in which you shot your footage in relationship to the chronology of the events that day?
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you explain that to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury?
Albert Lafferty: I was initially tasked with photographing the interior of the main residence before any search had been conducted.
Mr. Sneddon: And the purpose for that?
Albert Lafferty: To document the scene as it was before anything had been disturbed by any of the searching members.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you also participate in the production -- or did you also videotape the premises that day?
Albert Lafferty: That was my purpose, yes, that was to videotape.
Mr. Sneddon: So you did video and not still photography?
Albert Lafferty: I did several still photos, but my primary assignment was for video.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you did video, were you assigned to a particular location at the ranch premises?
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I was.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury where you were assigned?
Albert Lafferty: It was the main residence located on the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, were you also assigned responsibility subsequent to that time to take some aerial photographs?
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I was.
Mr. Sneddon: And what specifically was your assignment?
Albert Lafferty: To document the ranch property, overall views and specific views of the buildings located on the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recall when you did that?
Albert Lafferty: That was on March 2nd of 2004.
Mr. Sneddon: And in that connection, were you also assigned to do some research on just some basic information on the location of the ranch?
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And the purpose of that?
Albert Lafferty: To be able to identify in the photographs which buildings they were.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, were you also -- can you tell us whether or not you were involved in the preparation of an exhibit which was used for purposes of court demonstration, actual map location of the premises --
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- and the ranch itself --
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I was.
Mr. Sneddon: -- in relation to other places in Santa Barbara County?
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you describe to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what you did in that connection?
Albert Lafferty: In that connection what I did was use the Microsoft Streets and Map Program, which our unit had at the time, to display a map showing the surrounding area of Santa Ynez Valley and the location of the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, at this time I've had four -- I'm sorry, Exhibits 4 through 12 marked for identification purposes. I'm going to show them to counsel for their examination. I believe they have a copy of them already, but.... Your Honor, I intend to lay the foundation and ask for their admission. And I want to make sure the procedure's okay with the Court ahead of time and then display what I have here on the board --
The Court: That's --
Mr. Sneddon: -- as we go through them.
The Court: That's how I would like to do that.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, I have no objection if it will save time, he can put them on the board and show the witness at the same time, if that's all right with the Court.
The Court: Yes, it is. If there's no objection, that would save time.
Mr. Sneddon: Can we move these admitted into evidence at this time, then, Your Honor?
Mr. Sanger: In this case, that's fine, Your Honor. We'll do it that way.
The Court: In this case, they're admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: In this case, I'll accept it.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Deputy Lafferty, let me just hand you those. And let's start with the first exhibit. Could you indicate what People's Exhibit No. 4 is?
The Court: See, what he was suggesting, he agreed they come into evidence, so you could just put them right on the --
Mr. Auchincloss: We have it set up with the computer, Your Honor.
The Court: You do.
Mr. Auchincloss: If you could activate the PC button.
The Court: The PC button? Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: It takes a few minutes for the projector to warm up.
The Court: It's on, isn't it?
Mr. Auchincloss: It's coming.
Mr. Sneddon: Maybe we could dim the lights.
The Bailiff: Do you want all of them dimmed?
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Deputy Lafferty, could you explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what People's Exhibit No. 4 is?
Albert Lafferty: This is the map I made using the Microsoft Streets and Maps showing the Santa Ynez Valley area, community, and the ranch location.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, may I approach the witness?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I've handed you a little laser pen to help with some of the directions here. Could you locate, for instance, the town of Solvang on there for us?
Albert Lafferty: The City of Solvang is located right here in the lower center portion of the map.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And Los Olivos?
Albert Lafferty: Los Olivos is directly north of that. Right in this area.
Mr. Sneddon: Right under the word "California"?
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, I notice that towards the top of the exhibit, People's No. 4, and in the middle toward the top is a little red arrow; is that correct?
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you indicate to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what that red arrow -- and could you find it with the laser? There you go.
Albert Lafferty: This right here?
Mr. Sneddon: Yes. What is that?
Albert Lafferty: That's a small push pin used to identify the entrance location of the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's move to the next exhibit, People's 5, if we could. With regard to People's 5, it's in evidence, could you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what that is?
Albert Lafferty: This is a closer-in view of the area, with the town of Los Olivos being located in the center lower portion of the picture. The yellow line highlights Figueroa Mountain Road as it proceeds north from the town of Los Olivos and ends again at a red push pin indicating the ranch entrance.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, let's go to the next exhibit, People's No. 5 -- or No. 6. Could you explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what People's No. 6 is?
Albert Lafferty: This is an overall aerial photograph showing the ranch property.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to the information that's been placed on this exhibit, the writing that's on there in yellow, did you do that?
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: And from what sources of information did you put those letters and designations on there?
Albert Lafferty: That was information provided by Sergeant Robel and yourself.
Mr. Sneddon: You've been to the ranch yourself, though, have you not?
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I have.
Mr. Sneddon: So you recognize the areas depicted up there, correct?
Albert Lafferty: Yeah, that's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to this particular exhibit, People's No. 6, there's an arrow that points back towards Los Olivos?
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And the road just to the bottom on the diagram, that's marked Figueroa Mountain Road?
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know approximately what the distance is from the gate where it says "ranch entrance" to -- back to, say, where 154 -- Highway 154 is?
Albert Lafferty: It's just over five miles.
Mr. Sneddon: Could we go to People's No. 7? Now, People's No. 7 is another aerial photograph that you took?
Albert Lafferty: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to the designation of the -- of the areas of buildings located on this exhibit, did you put those on there?
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that based on your personal information and observations?
Albert Lafferty: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sneddon: While you were at the ranch?
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's go to the next number, if we could, which I believe is 8?
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And People's No. 8 is another aerial you took, correct?
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to the information placed on there, did you place that information on there?
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that information you gathered while you were personally at the ranch on the occasion that you were there?
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, I notice on this particular photograph, this particular exhibit, that there's a road that runs in the upper top of the photograph, about in the middle. Do you see that?
Albert Lafferty: This road here?
Mr. Sneddon: Yes, sir. Do you know where that road goes to?
Albert Lafferty: That was the road leading from the main gate entrance on Figueroa Mountain Road that we came in on.
Mr. Sneddon: So that's the road that takes you from the main gate to the house?
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And to the areas depicted on this photograph?
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Why don't we go to the next exhibit, then. This is No. 9?
Albert Lafferty: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to People's No. 9, did you place the designations on these particular areas?
Albert Lafferty: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: And this is another aerial that you took?
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Have you ever been in the theater itself?
Albert Lafferty: No, I have not.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's go to the next exhibit, which would be People's No. 10. And 10 is just a wider view of 9 but has more information; is that correct?
Albert Lafferty: Yes, slightly different angle.
Mr. Sneddon: And it just shows the theater and the amusement park?
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's go to People's No. 11. People's No. 11 is another aerial that you took; is that correct?
Albert Lafferty: It is correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And the designation that's on there is the zoo?
Albert Lafferty: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: That's the zoo area, as you know it to be?
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Or at the time you took these photographs?
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I believe there's one last photograph there, Deputy. What is that?
Albert Lafferty: This is an aerial view of the train station area.
Mr. Sneddon: And that's the -- okay. And that's another -- in this particular photograph, there is a road that runs directly into the train station where the clock is and goes to the bottom of the photograph.
Albert Lafferty: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know where that road leads to?
Albert Lafferty: That's the road that leads past the main residence.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Thank you. Your Honor, I do have more questions for this witness, but it will take considerably more than the two minutes we have left.
The Court: All right. We'll recess for the afternoon. Court's in recess.
