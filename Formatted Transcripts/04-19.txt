Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: Miss Arvizo, good morning.
Janet Arvizo: Good morning.
Mr. Zonen: Yesterday, there were a number of questions that were asked about that tape-recording of the phone call, or series of phone calls, between Frank and you that you listened to in court early in your testimony, and you had testified previously that you believed it was a compilation of a few different calls; is that correct?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Now, at any time during the series of telephone conversations that you had with Frank after you had left Neverland on that first occasion, did you talk with him about the specific issue of danger?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And what specifically did you tell him?
Janet Arvizo: The death threats about my children.
Mr. Zonen: How often did you bring up that subject in the course of those conversations?
Janet Arvizo: Every single time.
Mr. Zonen: You were asked some questions about attorneys that you had seen over the last number of years, and why you might have contacted an attorney to deal with Mr. Jackson. Do you remember those questions from Mr. Mesereau?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I do.
Mr. Zonen: It's a little confusing because apparently you have at one time or another dealt with two attorneys by the same name, Feldman; is that correct?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Zonen: The attorneys that you went to with regards to the J.C. Penney's lawsuit. What was the name of that law firm?
Janet Arvizo: The law firm was called Rothstein & Feldman.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Now, the Feldman that we're referring to, is that Larry Feldman?
Janet Arvizo: No. That is not Larry Feldman.
Mr. Zonen: It's a different Feldman?
Janet Arvizo: It is a different Feldman.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know his first name?
Janet Arvizo: I come to know now that his name is George Owen Feldman.
Mr. Zonen: Did you actually deal with Mr. Feldman, George Feldman?
Janet Arvizo: I've never dealt with George Owen Feldman.
Mr. Zonen: Who are the attorneys from that law firm, Feldman & Rothstein, who you actually dealt with?
Janet Arvizo: From that law firm, dealt with Mr. Rothstein, Anthony Ramieri, and a Michael Adler.
Mr. Zonen: Now, did you contact Feldman & Rothstein?
Janet Arvizo: And --
Mr. Zonen: Not Larry Feldman?
Janet Arvizo: There was one more, but he was with Michael Adler.
Mr. Zonen: Did you contact the law firm of Feldman & Rothstein for purposes of dealing with Michael Jackson in any way?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: When was the first time issues of Michael Jackson or actions involving Michael Jackson came up with a lawyer?
Janet Arvizo: Mr. Dickerman.
Mr. Zonen: And then Larry Feldman thereafter?
Janet Arvizo: Then Larry Feldman thereafter.
Mr. Zonen: There were questions that were asked of you by Mr. Mesereau as to the amount of money that Louise Palanker gave to you or your family. Did you ever ask Louise Palanker for money?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: How many separate checks were turned over to your family by Louise Palanker?
Janet Arvizo: It was two checks in the amount of $10,000.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Were you present at the time either of those checks were written?
Janet Arvizo: I wasn't present.
Mr. Zonen: Were you present at either time the checks were given to you?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know in advance that David was going to be given that money?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did he discuss it with you in any way prior to him getting the money from Louise Palanker?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you assist in cashing or depositing either of the two checks?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were you aware that one of them was written to you?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have to endorse that one, sign it?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: There's been a lot of testimony so far about the cleanroom at your mother's house for Gavin while he was ill. The money that came to create that clean room came from where?
Janet Arvizo: From Wheezy, Louise Palanker.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have any conversation with Louise Palanker, either before or after that check was given to you, about how that check would be used?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were you given any money by Fritz Coleman?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever ask for money from Fritz Coleman?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were you given any money by George or Ann Lopez?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever ask for money from either George or Ann Lopez?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were you present at any time when that issue of a wallet became the subject of discussion between George Lopez and your husband, your then husband David Arvizo?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were you aware of that at the time that it happened?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: When did you first learn about that incident?
Janet Arvizo: I think I heard it from Jamie. And this was after David was no longer with us.
Mr. Zonen: At some point in time, did you learn that there was an unnamed benefactor who was prepared to give you money?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading and beyond the scope.
The Court: Overruled. The answer was, “Yes”. Next question.
Mr. Zonen: Who is it who told you about that?
Janet Arvizo: Jamie.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; beyond the scope.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Zonen: The answer is in?
The Court: The answer was, “Jamie”.
Mr. Zonen: Was that Jamie Masada?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, that was Jamie Masada.
Mr. Zonen: What was your response to this offer of money?
Janet Arvizo: I told him, “No, thank you”; that all I wanted was friends and prayers.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know the name of the person who was this benefactor?
Janet Arvizo: I never knew.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember when that took place?
Janet Arvizo: This was -- the best I can remember, it was after all this Neverland stuff happened. That's the best I can remember.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever ask Jay Leno for money?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever meet Jay Leno?
Janet Arvizo: I've never met Jay Leno.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever have a telephone conversation with Jay Leno?
Janet Arvizo: I've never had a telephone conversation with Jay Leno.
Mr. Zonen: Were you ever present at the time your son made any telephone calls to Jay Leno or had a conversation with him?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were you present at any of the fund-raisers that took place at The Laugh Factory?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Mr. Mesereau asked you questions about medical insurance covering Gavin's illness during that period of time. Did his medical insurance cover all of the expenses of his illness during that period of time?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. This is correct.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever tell anybody that -- that insurance was not covering the medical expenses?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were you ever concerned about whether the medical insurance would continue?
Janet Arvizo: I was concerned because David wasn't working. He didn't want to go back to work.
Mr. Zonen: Did you express that concern to anybody, to your recollection?
Janet Arvizo: To my recollection, I don't think so.
Mr. Zonen: At one point you purchased an automobile -- or, excuse me. At one point -- let me do that one more time. You were asked a question by Mr. Mesereau as to whether or not you purchased an automobile. Did you actually take steps towards purchasing an automobile?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: What was it that you did toward purchasing an automobile?
Janet Arvizo: Okay. I had -- I had called a car dealership from a phone booth, from the phone book. And the person -- they transferred me over to the sales department. And the gentleman who spoke on the phone sounded really nice. So I figured that's the way I'm going to go, through this dealership, through this man. And then --
Mr. Zonen: Which dealership was it?
Janet Arvizo: I think it was -- I don't remember. But I remember it was -- I think it was Hollywood Ford. I think it was. That's the best I can remember. And so I had a -- I don't know whether it was a travelers check or a cashier's check, one of those things made out to that, in that amount, but I then changed my mind and I had it cancelled. But I -- so I never did purchase a car.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. You had a travelers check that you actually made out for a certain amount of money?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: Were you able to cancel that check?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I was. I -- yes. I didn't follow through with the purchase of the car.
Mr. Zonen: You were asked questions about conversations with Mr. Jackson by Mr. Mesereau. Prior to the phone call on the 5th of February, or the date that you received that phone call from Mr. Jackson when he was in Miami, inviting you to come to Miami, had you had any conversations with Mr. Jackson prior to that day?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Had you asked him for any money?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Prior to that date?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Or since that date?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you receive any money from him?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: What was the state of your -- what was your life like prior to that phone call?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
Mr. Zonen: Let me change the question.
Mr. Zonen: On the 4th of February, the day before you received that phone call, were there any problems that you were dealing with at that time?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Were your children healthy prior to that?
Janet Arvizo: Our life prior to Mr. Jackson's --
Mr. Zonen: No, just limit it to just the question.
Janet Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: Were your children healthy in early February?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Gavin was dealing with no medical issues other than the ones that he deals with on a regular basis?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Zonen: How long had you been in a relationship with Mr. Jackson at that time, Major Jackson?
Janet Arvizo: It was a new, promising relationship with him.
Mr. Zonen: Were you aware, prior to Mr. Jackson's telephone call to you, that he was even in Miami?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you express any desire to anybody to go to Miami?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Zonen: Your Honor, finally, this might be beyond the scope of the cross-examination in which I would ask the Court's indulgence to reopen. I've advised Mr. Mesereau of this. We neglected to show part of the surveillance tapes. We missed it on Friday. And I'd like to show the last part of it. It's about 60 seconds' worth, if I could do that at this time.
Mr. Mesereau: Beyond the scope, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. I'll allow you to reopen.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you.
Mr. Zonen: You had previously seen some surveillance tapes prior to coming into court and then you saw some surveillance tapes on Friday. This is an additional footage I'd like to show you at this time. And then we're going to stop the tape and have you identify it. If you could turn down the lights, please.
The Court: It's going to be on “Input 1”?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes, Your Honor. And we're on “Input 1”, Your Honor?
Mr. Zonen: Bob, did you rewire this?
The Court: I think you all ought to go together and hire a teenaged boy to handle this for you. (Laughter.)
Mr. Zonen: Any teenaged boy.
Mr. Sanger: You don't have that hooked up.
The Bailiff: Do you want to play it off the DVD?
Mr. Auchincloss: I think we'll just play it off the DVD. We'll need “Input 4”, Your Honor. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Auchincloss: Your Honor, I'm just going to fast-forward through a portion of it that we've already seen.
Mr. Zonen: We're ready, Your Honor. Go ahead and stop it.
Mr. Zonen: Miss Arvizo, do you recognize those people?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And who is that?
Janet Arvizo: This is now my now husband, Mr. Jay Jackson, and my two boys, Gavin and Star.
Mr. Zonen: And they appear to be carrying something. What is that?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. This is -- they're carrying their military uniforms.
Mr. Zonen: From the laundry?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, from the cleaners.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know what street they're on?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, actually, this is right near Jay's Army base, which is way far from where Jay was living.
Mr. Zonen: In West Los Angeles, do you mean?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And for the record, the date on the lower right-hand corner is March 20th, '03, and the time was 3:47 p.m. Go ahead, please. And stop it.
Mr. Zonen: They're stopping now. The date on the lower right-hand corner, March 21, '03, at 8:01 a.m. Do you know who's in that car?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I do.
Mr. Zonen: Who is that?
Janet Arvizo: This is me.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And that car is --
Janet Arvizo: And my boys.
Mr. Zonen: That car is your family car?
Janet Arvizo: This at the time was -- I'm now married to Jay, but that was Jay's car.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. The -- do you know where you are?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I am.
Mr. Zonen: Where is that, in this slide?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. Right here, I am dropping off the children at their school. Gavin and Star. I'm parked right there in front of their school.
Mr. Zonen: Is the school John Burroughs Middle School?
Janet Arvizo: This is John Burroughs Middle School.
Mr. Zonen: And would 8:01 a.m. be consistent with about the time that you would drop them off at school?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is consistent.
Mr. Zonen: Let's go ahead and -- March 21st was a day, in fact, that they went to school?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I had already by this time immediately reenrolled them back into John Burroughs Middle School.
Mr. Zonen: Go ahead. Go ahead, stop it.
Mr. Zonen: It now says March 22nd at 5:10 p.m. Do you know what we're looking at here?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is Jay Jackson's apartment. Where you see that little rag or shirt, rag, shirt, hanging off the balcony, that's his apartment. His -- I don't know -- what's that called? Balcony. That's what it is, balcony. And right beyond the palm you can see me, I'm standing right there.
Mr. Zonen: And again, this says March 22nd, '03, at 5:10 p.m.
Janet Arvizo: So if you look closer to the wall where the palm is, right above the palm, that's me.
Mr. Zonen: Stop it for just one second.
Mr. Zonen: I've asked to stop it one more time. Just a couple of questions. Behind this apartment building, what is there? In other words, is it a parking lot or something that's right behind? Let me ask it differently.
Janet Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: Are we looking at the back of the apartment or the front?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, you are looking at the back of the apartment building.
Mr. Zonen: Standing up on the balcony where you appear to be, what can you see looking down?
Janet Arvizo: You can see the street. You can see other apartments. And beyond that, you can see the actual -- like a little eating area, market area, stuff like that.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Janet Arvizo: This was Korea Town.
Mr. Zonen: Can you tell, based on looking at this picture, where the person would be who is taking the photograph?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. Based on this angle, they would be right there, on the street, because right there is an actual city street.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know the name of the street right there?
Janet Arvizo: No, I don't. It's just the back side of the apartment building. The apartment building is surrounded by three public city streets. And that's one of them.
Mr. Zonen: Were you aware -- I mean, now that you know the date, March 22nd, were you aware at that time you were being filmed actually at that time?
Janet Arvizo: No. It's by -- by -- sometimes I would see them and sometimes I wouldn't.
Mr. Zonen: But on this particular occasion --
Janet Arvizo: But on this particular occasion, I did not see them.
Mr. Zonen: Go ahead. Your Honor, we have no further questions.
The Court: Mr. Mesereau?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please.
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Miss Arvizo, the day after you claim you were beaten severely in the J.C. Penney parking lot, you returned to J.C. Penney, true?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; exceeding the scope of the redirect examination.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you told -- the prosecutor asked you about -- excuse me. Let me rephrase it. The prosecutor asked you about what happened to you in the parking lot in his redirect examination, okay? And I'd like to explore some more of those facts, all right? You were in a public parking lot, what time of day?
Janet Arvizo: I was in a public parking -- I don't know if you know a mall. Way, way, way at the end. And this particular area where we're talking about, there's actually no windows, no anything. It's almost empty.
Mr. Mesereau: It was a public parking lot at J.C. Penney, true?
Janet Arvizo: Incorrect. It was a mall parking lot, which was at the furthest distance where this Tower Records sits independently. And there's no windows or no -- nothing of view. So it's kind of like in a -- the farthest away, where -- it's almost isolated, that area.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that where your car was parked?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is where the car was parked.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that where Gavin ran to with the items that were not paid for?
Janet Arvizo: I wouldn't know that. I wasn't there.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, at some point, you saw something going on near the automobile, correct?
Janet Arvizo: That's incorrect.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see something going on near your automobile in the parking lot?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see something going on at some point that concerned you?
Janet Arvizo: That's too vague. Everything concerned me.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, at some point, did you walk out of a building and see some activity around Gavin and David?
Janet Arvizo: When I had came out of the mall, I had to walk the farthest distance of the parking lot and that's where I saw David getting beat up by this male and this female. But, no, I did not see Gavin.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you tell the jury the other day that nothing happened to David?
Janet Arvizo: As far as to the extent that happened to me, no. But I did see him getting hit by this male and this female.
Mr. Mesereau: And for how long did you see David being hit by a male and a female?
Janet Arvizo: The best I can remember, it's from when I had view of to where I walked up to them.
Mr. Mesereau: How far away from the car was David when you saw him being beaten up by J.C. Penney security people?
Janet Arvizo: Well, initially I didn't see where the car was. I just saw David. It's until afterwards did I become aware where the car was located.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn that Gavin had the car keys with him?
Janet Arvizo: I was explained that afterwards.
Mr. Mesereau: And where were you coming from?
Janet Arvizo: I was coming from having had accepted a job for loss prevention from Oshman's.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you claim that at one point one of the J.C. Penney security guards twisted your neck, correct?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You said the person got behind you, put a hand on your chin, grabbed your hair and twisted your neck, true?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You said your head was being pulled from side to side, front and back, correct?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct. And these are things that are happening all in a fast motion. But this attorney, defense attorney, wanted me to break it down to millisecond to millisecond.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you break it down from millisecond to millisecond?
Janet Arvizo: I tried to do my best.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you tell the truth?
Janet Arvizo: Of course.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you said one of the J.C. Penny security guards was calling you “Bitch, bitch”, right?
Janet Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to see your --
Janet Arvizo: I'm saying I think so. I'm saying yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, J.C. Penney security guards were assaulting you, if you remember?
Janet Arvizo: The best I can remember, it was two males and a female, and then that other one from that other store. That's the best I can remember. And we're talking about this event that occurred almost seven years ago.
Mr. Mesereau: You walked over to where you saw David being struck, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And you claim you never struck anyone, true?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You claim you never resisted in any shape or form, right?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You were just attacked by these people for no reason, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You said your head was being twisted like the exorcist, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said that someone struck you with their knee, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said at some point you were --
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to object as hearsay, unless it's inconsistent with current testimony. The deposition would be hearsay.
The Court: Overruled. You may proceed.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you were dragged on the ground, true?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And who dragged you?
Janet Arvizo: I remember how he looked, and it was one -- it was one of the J.C. Penney's people. That's the best I can remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you were handcuffed at one point, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I was.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were then dragged with the handcuffs, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you had trouble breathing, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You fell and you were dragged and dragged and dragged, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That was in public view, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Like I said, this area is the furthest of the shopping parking mall and it's actually almost behind this building, Tower Records. And on this side of the building, there is no windows. So, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it a public parking lot?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it a parking lot attached to a mall?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was J.C. Penney's in that mall?
Janet Arvizo: J.C. Penney's was on the other side of the mall.
Mr. Mesereau: Was Tower Records in the mall?
Janet Arvizo: No, Tower Records is an independent building, and that's where these people did what they did.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you said your head, neck, arms, hand, fingers, back, butt, thighs and calves were all injured, right?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately what time this happened?
Janet Arvizo: Okay. Like I said before, this is something that happened seven years ago, and the best I can remember, it was in the afternoon. Actually, the afternoon.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know what day it was?
Janet Arvizo: No. I can't.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you arrived sometime between 6:00 and 6:30, correct?
Janet Arvizo: That sounds about right.
Mr. Mesereau: And was it during the week or a weekend, if you remember?
Janet Arvizo: I wouldn't be able to tell you that.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you said that David was driving around the parking lot and delaying what you were doing because you were kissing him over and over, right?
Janet Arvizo: The best I can remember -- the best I can remember is that David couldn't find a parking space close to the mall. And so, yes, I was. I was happy to have a job.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said that your appointment was delayed because you were driving around the mall with David kissing him, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Like I said, there was no parking near the entrance area. So he was trying to find a parking space.
Mr. Mesereau: There was no parking because the lot seemed pretty full, true?
Janet Arvizo: No. The -- since I was just going to run in and out to go pick up the drug test, and we were on our way to go wash clothes, so that's why.
Mr. Mesereau: But you testified under oath you were driving around the lot because David -- because you kept kissing David, right?
Janet Arvizo: He was my husband.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you say that?
Janet Arvizo: That -- yeah, that he was my husband.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that your testimony?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, yesterday, you said Gavin was six or seven, correct?
Janet Arvizo: It's approximately six, seven, maybe -- the boys are about a year difference. So depending -- if we count back seven years, so maybe six, seven, seven, eight, about there. Because you didn't ask me specifically. You said “boys”, I think.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you testified on December 14th, the year 2000, that Gavin was eight years old when this happened, right?
Janet Arvizo: When -- when -- he's mixing up things purposely. My son was deposed right in the middle of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. And that -- and at that age, he was ten years of age. But when this happened, he must have been -- the boys are a year apart. He was either six or seven, seven or eight. And this is the best I can remember. The deposition was done when my son Gavin was ten and my son Star was nine.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember testifying that Gavin was eight years old when that incident happened?
Janet Arvizo: This was seven years ago. The best I can tell you is either the boys were six and seven, or seven and eight. They're only a year difference. So -- I'm not really good at math, so if you would like to subtract seven years from now, that's about when.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you testified that one of the security guards, a female, kept using the “F” word at you, right?
Janet Arvizo: I think so. I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: That she was going to “F” you up, right?
Janet Arvizo: I think so, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And she said -- you testified she called you an “F asshole”, right?
Janet Arvizo: I think so, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to see your testimony?
Janet Arvizo: No, I'm saying yes, I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: And you testified she did this for no reason, right?
Janet Arvizo: That's how I felt. That's my opinion.
Mr. Mesereau: They didn't know --
Janet Arvizo: Because definitely I did not go inside the store. And definitely I did not do what they were claiming that I had done, which was burglary, petty theft and assault and battery.
Mr. Mesereau: And this woman said this to you when you walked over to what was happening to David?
Janet Arvizo: I think they were just overzealous security. And so they did what they did. I think they themself were in the moment.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you said you were hit with a closed fist, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: By this woman; right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you saw David being choked, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you also mentioned that a male security guard assaulted you, correct?
Janet Arvizo: They all assaulted me.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point you hit the ground, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And while this happened, the security guards kept cursing at you, right?
Janet Arvizo: I believe it was only the -- one of the males, and the female.
Mr. Mesereau: You indicated that one of the security guards took his badge and twisted it into your face, correct?
Janet Arvizo: I think so. But at that time I couldn't tell there was a badge.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you testified that he took a badge, twisted it into your face and said to you, “For the tenth time”, and did it, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I came to find out afterwards that that's what it was.
Mr. Mesereau: You testified you thought you were going to die, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, it did feel that way.
Mr. Mesereau: And at no time did you resist any of this assault, right?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said at some point you were face down on your stomach, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said at no time did David ever come over to help you, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You said he just stood there on the sidewalk, right?
Janet Arvizo: That's right. He just stood there on the sidewalk.
Mr. Mesereau: You said that the woman was hitting you over the head with her handcuffs, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said she was pulling your hair, right?
Janet Arvizo: This says -- if -- yeah, that's the best I can remember.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said the male security guard is the one who grabbed your breasts and touched you in your private areas, right?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You also said he was kicking you, right?
Janet Arvizo: I think so. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And the woman was kicking you as well, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said you had no idea why you were being assaulted this way, right?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you were being choked, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you were kneed by one of the two guards, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said they all scratched you, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. I did receive scratches.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you were hit with handcuffs that were like brass knuckles, right?
Janet Arvizo: They had -- I was trying to describe where they were on their hand.
Mr. Mesereau: You said that you were smashed like a cockroach, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Probably so.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you say that?
Janet Arvizo: I probably did, trying to -- for them to get a visual.
Mr. Mesereau: You said that the male was holding on to your breast with one hand, right?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You said they were hitting you all at the same time everywhere, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said that Star was assaulted for no reason, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said Gavin was assaulted for no reason, right?
Janet Arvizo: That's right.
Mr. Mesereau: And how many security guards do you remember being in the parking lot with your family?
Janet Arvizo: Okay. The best I can remember is first it was the male and female. Then another male. Then another male. And then way towards the end, there was another male, but that other male didn't do a single thing. That's the best I can remember.
Mr. Mesereau: You said everything became like an echo, like a cave in a tunnel, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. It did.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's when you thought you were going to pass away, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Pass out.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you said you thought you were going to die, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, but you're taking it -- he's mixing up words. I did feel that way.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said they took Gavin and they shoved him into some vomit, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said at some point Gavin just laid there, right?
Janet Arvizo: He did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Were you handcuffed standing up or when you were on the ground; do you know?
Janet Arvizo: I -- I remember that. And the best is -- yes, I was laying down when they handcuffed me.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said at one point you were called an “F-ing wetback”, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said they were all laughing while they did this, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, they were.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said Gavin and Star were following while you were dragged, right?
Janet Arvizo: Oh, yes. Oh, that is -- that is burned right there.
Mr. Mesereau: You said at one point your breasts were outside your blouse and Gavin helped you redress, right?
Janet Arvizo: Gavin and Star. My breasts were outside of my bra, and the boys -- because I was handcuffed, the boys got my breasts, put them inside my bra and buttoned me up. So, yes, it was my boys.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said that one of the security guards told you, “I hate blacks and I hate Mexicans”, right?
Janet Arvizo: One of the security guards, that was his focus.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that what you claim that one of them said?
Janet Arvizo: I think so. But, you know, I'm -- since -- this is seven years ago. This is the best I can remember. And since he takes things out of context and mixes words around, I'm -- you know, but that does sound correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You said under oath, “Gary said, 'I hate blacks and I hate Mexicans'”, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You were asked how you felt about the fact that clothes were taken without being paid for and that's when you said, “David is extremely honest. He's too honest”, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: You said Gavin helped you get your cell phone out of your pocket, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I remember that.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were both dialing 9-1-1, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point, all of you were arrested, right, you and David and the children?
Janet Arvizo: The children were never arrested.
Mr. Mesereau: Did they go to the station with you?
Janet Arvizo: No, they never went to the station.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did they go?
Janet Arvizo: They -- when I was standing outside, the police officer did not want to take the boys into custody. So he had the station call my parents. My parents came. And my -- and the officer gave the boys to my parents and that's from right there. Then I was taken to the police station after my parents came from there, from the area, and took the children with them.
Mr. Mesereau: And you went to the station, correct?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Your photograph was taken, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did your photograph show bruises on your face?
Janet Arvizo: I don't think so. I had makeup on at the time.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember testifying that at the station, you didn't show bruising, you showed marks, correct?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You said, “As days went by, they started getting darker and changing colors, you know, every day, every week”, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you had no black and blue marks prior to the incident, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you questions about a woman who worked at the law firm that represented you named Mary Holzer, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told Mary Holzer that the photographs in the J.C. Penney case were the result of David's beatings, not anybody at J.C. Penney, right?
Janet Arvizo: That's incorrect.
Mr. Mesereau: You said your hand was broken, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. Right here.
Mr. Mesereau: You said they stomped on your hand, correct?
Janet Arvizo: I think so. I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you that page?
Janet Arvizo: No, I'm saying I think so, so that's a “yes”.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't ask that anyone in your family be taken to a hospital, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I did. I asked -- I asked the officer and the officer said, “We're going to just process you. It shouldn't take long. And then you can go to the doctor's”.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember testifying, your response to the following question: “Did you urge anybody at any time, including to the police, that either of your sons be taken to the hospital or receive emergency treatment?” And the answer was, “No”? Do you remember that?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were asked, “Why is that? You didn't think there was an emergency?” You said, “At that point I could breathe again. And since my mom knows how to fix everything, you know” -- “Q. You were going to leave it in her hands? You said, “Yes”, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. You said you're not a doctor, and you didn't have any reason to think you needed emergency treatment, right?
Janet Arvizo: That's correct. But there's also somewhere in the deposition where I stated -- what I had asked the J.C. Penney's people, for them to call the paramedics or something like that - this is the best I can remember - and he declined it. And it's in there.
Mr. Mesereau: And you testified at the time you just wanted the J.C. Penney guards arrested. You didn't want any lawsuit, right?
Janet Arvizo: Show me that.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Janet Arvizo: So this is correct, then.
Mr. Zonen: I'll object as vague to the question, “at the time”. At the time of the deposition or the time of the event?
The Court: You're refreshing her memory. Go ahead.
Janet Arvizo: That's right. At --
The Court: Wait. Just a moment.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said in that deposition under oath?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you wanted them arrested, you weren't interested in suing, right?
Janet Arvizo: That's correct. At that moment, that second, when the officers came, that's what I wanted.
Mr. Mesereau: You later changed your mind and decided to file a suit, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Because the time had already expired for these people to be arrested.
Mr. Mesereau: You claim you had a back injury, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: You said prior to this event you had never had a back injury before?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You were asked if you knew whether or not David was aware that Gavin was going to run out of the store with the unpurchased items, and you said, “I didn't have to, no. I know David's honest character”, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You testified that in the parking lot, your breasts were fondled for minutes, not seconds, right?
Janet Arvizo: That's how I felt.
Mr. Mesereau: You said your pelvic area was touched for minutes, correct?
Janet Arvizo: That's how I felt.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you were hit with closed fists, right?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; asked and answered.
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said the security guard spit intentionally --
Mr. Zonen: There was an objection to the last question, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: You said the security guards at J.C. Penney spit intentionally into Star's face, correct?
Janet Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if you see that?
Janet Arvizo: I think so. “I think so” meaning “yes”.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you say that under oath?
Janet Arvizo: I don't know if -- this is seven years ago, so I don't know whether it was Star or Gavin, so that's why I'm saying yes, I think so. But since he said Star --
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to look at the deposition transcript?
Janet Arvizo: Okay. I'm saying to you, because he's saying this, I said yes, I think so --
The Court: Just a moment.
Janet Arvizo: Okay.
The Court: He asked you a question whether it would refresh your recollection to look at the transcript.
Janet Arvizo: It's okay. I remember it happening to one of my boys. And he's specifying --
The Court: Ma'am, you're not answering my question.
Janet Arvizo: Okay.
The Court: Do you want -- will it refresh your recollection to look at the transcript?
Janet Arvizo: It's a yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You also said the security guards started spitting pumpkin seeds at your family, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Oh, yeah, I remember that. That's right there, burned.
Mr. Mesereau: And at that point in the deposition is where you said that David Arvizo had never struck you or your children at any time, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you first go to a lawyer after this incident?
Janet Arvizo: I think it was about a year later.
Mr. Mesereau: So a year after the incident you change your mind and decided you did want to sue, right?
Janet Arvizo: That was too long ago, the question.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, during the time of the alleged events you described, you said you weren't going to sue anyone and then you changed your mind, right?
Janet Arvizo: There was a criminal proceedings. I was charged with crimes. I was charged with burglary, petty theft, assault and battery. That process took months. And those people needed to apologize.
Mr. Mesereau: So you only sued for an apology?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: At one point didn't your lawyer ask for millions of dollars?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: But you accepted 152,000, right?
Janet Arvizo: No. On -- in my hand, what I received, was only about 32,000. That's it.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, did you talk to the prosecutor last night about what you were going to testify to today?
Janet Arvizo: I -- on the telephone he spoke to me that he would like to show these surveillance videos, and that's it.
Mr. Mesereau: Did the prosecutor talk to you last night about Louise Palanker?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember testifying yesterday you didn't know what happened to the money Louise Palanker gave you and David?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: But last night you talked to the prosecutor and now you remember it was used on the room for Gavin?
Janet Arvizo: No. He refreshed my memory as far as what it was. That's all.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you said today -- excuse me. Let me rephrase. You said today that you never asked for any money to help Gavin, right?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, the only person in your family that ever asked for money to help Gavin was David, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. This is -- now I know.
Mr. Mesereau: But on the Washington Mutual account, which was set up to take funds for Gavin, you were the signatory, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You were the one who withdrew money from the account, correct?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: So you're on that account for Gavin which you have no knowledge of any fund-raisers, right?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You're the signatory on that account, but you don't know why anybody even deposits money into it, correct?
Mr. Zonen: That's argumentative. Objection.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Janet Arvizo: Okay. Can you ask it differently?
Mr. Mesereau: Sure. You've said you had no knowledge of any fund-raisers for Gavin, correct?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you never asked anybody for any financial help at any time, right?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you never asked anybody for financial help to assist Gavin, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Yet at the same time, you set up a bank account --
Janet Arvizo: Is this a question or a statement, what you're starting right now?
Mr. Mesereau: Yet at the same time, you set up a bank account for Gavin's benefit with you being the signatory, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I did follow David's instructions.
Mr. Mesereau: And you have no idea why anybody put any money into that account, correct?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You just saw the money there and withdrew it, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. I was David's personal secretary.
Mr. Mesereau: Never asked a question of anybody, “Where did this money come from?” Right?
Janet Arvizo: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Just assumed it was for you to withdraw, right?
Janet Arvizo: No. I did what David told me.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said yesterday you couldn't remember what any of that money was spent on, right?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you had no idea that Chris Tucker was going to wire some money into that account, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And all your discussions with your friend Azja Pryor, who was his fiancee, the issue of Chris Tucker giving money never came up, right?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct. Like I testified yesterday, I didn't become friends with Azja until after David was completely out of the picture. While Gavin was sick we hardly even spoke. The one I spoke most to was Ann Lopez.
Mr. Mesereau: And in your discussions with Ann Lopez, you never learned that George Lopez was planning to put together a fund-raiser for Gavin, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And in all your discussions with Jamie Masada, you never learned that he was putting any fund-raisers together for Gavin's benefit, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yeah, this is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And in any of your discussions with Fritz Coleman, you never learned that Fritz Coleman was helping to assist your family with Gavin's illness, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: No one told you about any of this, right?
Janet Arvizo: That's right.
Mr. Mesereau: You never knew that comedians showed up at The Laugh Factory on a number of occasions to help raise money for Gavin, right?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You never knew that Gavin was in the lobby with his father accepting funds, right?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you said you began to buy a car and then changed your mind, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. This is true.
Mr. Mesereau: And approximately when was that?
Janet Arvizo: The best I can remember, the best, because I never even stepped foot in the dealership, was the fall of 2001. I think -- no. No, no, that's incorrect. I apologize. It was definitely the fall. No, it was, the fall of 2001. That's the best I can remember.
Mr. Mesereau: And was the company that you were going to purchase an automobile from Hollywood Ford?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, it was.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you go to Hollywood Ford yourself?
Janet Arvizo: I never went to Hollywood Ford.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you communicate with Hollywood Ford?
Janet Arvizo: I looked in the phone book, and I -- I got their phone number from there, and I called.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall using any money that had been donated for Gavin's benefit on cosmetic surgery?
Janet Arvizo: No, I used a credit card.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your credit card?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. My credit card. Which is still outstanding.
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to object as exceeding the scope of the redirect.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor mentioned the room that was constructed for Gavin at your parents' house, okay? Do you remember him asking you questions about that?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's the room that today you say Louise Palanker's money was spent on, right?
Janet Arvizo: This is what Mr. Zonen made me aware, refreshed my memory yesterday.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you hire a contractor to fix up that room?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know if anyone did?
Janet Arvizo: I now know that David did hire, through Wheezy, through Louise Palanker. I know now.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have anything to do with a contractor fixing up that room for Gavin?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever meet a contractor who was fixing up that room for Gavin?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you even tell a contractor what to do to fix the room up for Gavin?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have any involvement at all in making sure that room was fixed up properly to help Gavin with his illness?
Janet Arvizo: I think so. It's my mom's house. It started with it being in my mom's house.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see it being repaired?
Janet Arvizo: No. I was with my two other children.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember when it was repaired by a contractor so that it would be an appropriate room for Gavin?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You never had a discussion with anyone about what the requirements were for Gavin in that room?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: That was all David, too; is that correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: So David was the one who was telling the contractor what the specifications were for this renovated room, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And David was the one telling the contractor what Gavin's requirements were to make sure he didn't get exposed to germs and things of that sort, right?
Janet Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Was all David, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. I wasn't there. I was with my two other kids.
Mr. Mesereau: It was done at your parents' home but David was the one taking care of everything, right?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; asked and answered.
Janet Arvizo: Yes, that's correct.
The Court: Sustained. Just a moment. Next question.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, in response to the prosecutor's questions, you said that you never obtained any of the money from the first Louise Palanker check, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: That was a $10,000 check written to Janet Arvizo, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that presented to you by David?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, who presented the check to you?
Janet Arvizo: I -- I think this is how it went. I endorsed it, give it back to David, and that was it.
Mr. Mesereau: You just said -- excuse me. Who gave you the check to begin with?
Janet Arvizo: David had me endorse it, and that's it.
Mr. Mesereau: And you know --
Janet Arvizo: I think so. That's how it happened.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know David was going to deposit the check into your parents' account?
Janet Arvizo: Now I understand, this is my understanding, that my mother cashed it for him.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't know that was going to happen at the time?
Janet Arvizo: No, I was with my two other kids.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you saw a check for $10,000 --
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: -- made out to Janet Arvizo, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you knew it was made out to you by Louise Palanker, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you're saying that David asked you to endorse it, but didn't tell you where it was going?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you never knew until recently that it was deposited into your parents' account?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When did you first learn it had been deposited into your parents' account?
Janet Arvizo: It wasn't deposited, it was cashed. Just with a lot of events that are occurring now.
Mr. Mesereau: And you never knew where any of that money went, true?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct. I was -- I did what David told me. I was like his personal secretary.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn that Louise Palanker had written a second check for $10,000 to David?
Janet Arvizo: I am aware now.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know at the time?
Janet Arvizo: At the time, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you were communicating with Louise Palanker a lot at that point, weren't you?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, I was.
Mr. Mesereau: Wheezy was your friend, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Still.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were talking to her quite often, were you not?
Janet Arvizo: I feel -- I feel I was.
Mr. Mesereau: Yet, Wheezy never mentioned she was contributing $20,000 to your family?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Wheezy never mentioned she was writing a $10,000 check to you?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Wheezy never mentioned she was writing a $10,000 check to David?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You never knew anything about this, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, this is correct. At that time, David -- David was more in control of all these previous friendships that I had had.
Mr. Mesereau: By the way, do you recall David's using Von's to cash checks?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn that David would go to Von's and cash checks?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. To your knowledge, did David have his own account anywhere at that time?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: He had no bank account at all?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he use a credit union at Von's?
Janet Arvizo: Maybe. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: But you never heard anything about that, right?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, in one of the police reports involving David's domestic violence, you said you had been abused by him throughout your marriage, true?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; exceeding the scope of the redirect.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: It would have to do with her injuries, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. I'll allow the question.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling the police, when David was arrested, that throughout your 16-year marriage he had physically abused you?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. Finally I said something.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the police that he would hit you on all parts of your body, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: You said he forced your head under water, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: You said he prevented you from wearing makeup, right?
Janet Arvizo: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And in a number of interviews with the police, you said he had beaten you throughout that marriage, right?
Janet Arvizo: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: Yet, in the J.C. Penney case, you said none of your bruises or injuries had anything to do with David, right?
Janet Arvizo: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: When you testified under oath in the J.C. Penney case that initially you weren't bruised but as time went on they got blacker and blacker, what did you mean?
Janet Arvizo: Well, that I had -- even though I had -- I did have visible abrasions, that even though these people had hit me, it wasn't immediate. I could see them.
Mr. Mesereau: Did your attorney have those photographs taken that the prosecutor introduced into evidence yesterday?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't go to a lawyer till a year later, right?
Janet Arvizo: No. He's incorrect. Those photographs were taken immediately with the criminal court proceedings. That stuff, criminal case, whatever. Had nothing to do with the civil case. I had those photos already. Well, actually, my -- the defense attorney had those photos.
Mr. Mesereau: Who hired the photographer?
Janet Arvizo: Actually, I think it was -- I don't remember very clear. I don't remember very clear. But it was per the defense attorney's actions, ways, I don't know what you would call it, suggestion. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: It wasn't taken -- excuse me. Those photos were not taken by the police, correct?
Janet Arvizo: This is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: They were taken at the direction of a lawyer, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Yes. This is correct. A defense attorney. Not a civil lawyer.
Mr. Mesereau: Where were those photos taken?
Janet Arvizo: That I do remember. It's at -- it's a place in El Monte. I don't remember the name, but it's El Monte.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it an office of a photographer?
Janet Arvizo: No, it's actually one of those, like, one-hour photo places.
Mr. Mesereau: Who took you there?
Janet Arvizo: I think it was David. Yes, I think it was David.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know when he took you there?
Janet Arvizo: Immediately.
Mr. Mesereau: But didn't you testify in the deposition you didn't have these bruises immediately?
Janet Arvizo: No. That's right. When the -- when the defense attorney had told us, then that's the time.
Mr. Mesereau: Who went there to get their photographs taken?
Janet Arvizo: I believe it was me and David. And then I think Gavin was -- the boys were with us. I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: And were you doing this all at the direction of David?
Janet Arvizo: No. I was doing it in the direction of the defense attorney.
Mr. Mesereau: And what was this defense attorney's name?
Janet Arvizo: Mr. Fountain.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you questions about Attorney Bill Dickerman. You first met Attorney Bill Dickerman on February 21st, 2003, correct?
Janet Arvizo: Incorrect. I remember the date. It was February 25th.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever tell anyone that you met with Bill Dickerman on February 21st?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever discussed with Bill Dickerman the date you first met him?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you aware of Gavin telephoning Jay Leno at any time?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never heard anything about that?
Janet Arvizo: No. I've heard now.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Gavin ever tell you, “I tried to reach Jay Leno”?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you ever standing in the background during a phone call that Gavin made to Jay Leno?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever spoken to Jay Leno?
Janet Arvizo: I've never spoken to Jay Leno.
Mr. Mesereau: If I may just take one second, Your Honor, I'll be ready to wrap this up.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you aware of Gavin making any attempt to contact celebrities by phone?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, did Gavin ever try to contact any celebrity from your home?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever contact any celebrity from your home?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you attempt to contact any celebrities at any time?
Janet Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions.
Message: FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: Ms. Arvizo, did you earlier testify that you had contacted George Lopez when your son became ill?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you contact any other people when your son became ill to notify them that he was ill?
Janet Arvizo: I think I contacted Jamie Masada, Louise. These are all previous people that I had already known before Gavin had become ill. And that's it. That's the best I can remember.
Mr. Zonen: When did you first learn that Gavin had been injured in the altercation at J.C. Penney's?
Janet Arvizo: Okay. My parents had came and picked up the children from the parking lot, because the officer did not want to take them to the police station. And so it was my mom who called me up and told me that -- that she's tried everything, everything, first aid, and that was still not enough for the kids to feel better.
Mr. Zonen: You say she called you up. Where did she call you?
Janet Arvizo: She called me -- at that time I had a cell phone.
Mr. Zonen: But where were you at the time? At what time was this?
Janet Arvizo: I was staying in the place that we were staying in.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. I'm asking you when. So had you already been arrested and released from jail?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And had you already gone to the hospital?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: For your own injuries?
Janet Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: So at the time that you were being arrested at J.C. Penney's in the parking lot, were you aware that Gavin was injured at that time?
Janet Arvizo: I had seen them, the way they had hit both the boys, but I figured my mom, you know, could do what she always does, and in first aid, just like when they fall or scrape or anything, that she can tend to them. So that's what I figured. I didn't think it was beyond what my mother could care for. But my mom made me aware that it was beyond her capability.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know at the time that you were arrested that your son Gavin had a broken elbow?
Janet Arvizo: No, I didn't.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know at the time that you were arrested that you had a broken bone in your hand or wrist?
Janet Arvizo: No, I didn't.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you. I have no further questions.
The Court: All right. We'll take our morning break.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Any further questions, Mr. Mesereau?
Mr. Mesereau: No, Your Honor.
The Court: Call your next witness.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you, Your Honor. We'll call Detective Vic Alvarez to the stand, please.
The Court: Come forward, please. When you get to the witness stand, remain standing. Face the clerk over here, and raise your right hand.
Message: VICTOR M. ALVAREZ Having been sworn, testified as follows:
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
The Clerk: Please be seated. State and spell your name for the record.
Victor Alvarez: Victor M. Alvarez; A-l-v-a-r-e-z.
The Clerk: Thank you.
Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: Detective Alvarez, you've previously testified in these proceedings, have you not?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And identified yourself as a detective with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: You're going to be testifying to a number of different items this morning, although fairly rapidly. Is that your understanding?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Now, the last time that you were on the witness stand testifying, or perhaps one of the last few times you were on the witness stand testifying, you were testifying to some items that you had personally seized from Neverland Ranch during the course of that search back in November of '02; is that correct?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: November 18, '02, am I right?
Victor Alvarez: '03.
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry --
Victor Alvarez: It would be '03.
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry, '03. Okay. November 18 of '03. Exactly. At the time of your testimony, you had -- one particular item had fallen out of a bag and was not present in court at the time it was presented to you. Is that your recollection?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: I'd like to show you Court Exhibit 822. Court Exhibit 822, and specifically -- occupational hazard here -- specifically Sheriff's No. 304-B. Would you take a look at this item and tell us if you recognize that item?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Is that an item that you seized?
Victor Alvarez: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: Is that the item that fell out of the bag?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. And just describe it for us, please.
Victor Alvarez: It is a -- appears to be a paperback. It is titled, “The Art of Dave Nestler”, N-e-s-t-l-e-r.
Mr. Zonen: Was that taken to another detective who then booked it into evidence?
Victor Alvarez: The title is “Wicked Intentions” and -- yes.
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry, there were two questions. The title of the magazine again was what, please?
Victor Alvarez: “Wicked Intentions”.
Mr. Zonen: And that magazine was then booked in by whom?
Victor Alvarez: I believe it was Detective Padilla.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. I would move to introduce that item into evidence at this time, Your Honor.
Mr. Sanger: I need to cross-examine on that, if I may, please, before the Court rules.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you.
The Court: I'll withhold ruling on that.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. I'll proceed with other exhibits, if I may.
Mr. Zonen: Detective Alvarez, did you have an opportunity to review a number of VHS videos and compare them as against a number of DVDs?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. I would like to show you each of the DVDs and each of the videos and ask you if, in fact, they are duplicate copies of one another, if I may.
Victor Alvarez: Sure.
Mr. Zonen: May I approach the witness?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Let me begin with four court exhibits, and the four court exhibits are No. 815, a DVD; 816, a DVD; 817, a DVD; and 818, a DVD. Have you seen those four previously?
Victor Alvarez: I have.
Mr. Zonen: And can you tell us if you viewed the contents of those four?
Victor Alvarez: I have.
Mr. Zonen: And what is the subject matter of those four DVDs?
Victor Alvarez: These are surveillance tapes.
Mr. Zonen: Is one of a residence on Soto Street?
Victor Alvarez: One is a residence on Soto Street.
Mr. Zonen: And the other three?
Victor Alvarez: Of Ramer Street. One of Jay Jackson. One of Davellin.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Did you -- were you in court on Friday where some of those surveillance tapes were played?
Victor Alvarez: Yes, I was.
Mr. Zonen: And are those, in fact, the same as the ones that you're currently holding?
Victor Alvarez: They are.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Now, did you have an opportunity to compare them as against videotapes?
Victor Alvarez: I did.
Mr. Zonen: Let me now show you exhibits for identification, please, No. 823, No. 824, No. 825 and No. 826. And could you take a moment and look at each of those four VHS videos?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do those four correspond to the four DVDs you've already identified?
Victor Alvarez: They do.
Mr. Zonen: Are they duplicates of them?
Victor Alvarez: The DVDs are actual exact copies of the VHS tapes.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you. No further questions.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: Exhibit 822, Detective --
Victor Alvarez: Yes. The magazine.
Mr. Sanger: The magazine. It's just a separate magazine?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: That's marked as 822, correct?
Victor Alvarez: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And you've indicated that it was actually 304-B as designated by the sheriff's department. Was that your testimony?
Victor Alvarez: Yes. That's -- it came from Item 304, the original item, and this is -- this was found with Item No. 304.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So really it was not booked into sheriff's department evidence as 304-B, was it?
Victor Alvarez: I believe it was.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. On your booking form, your sheriff's department booking form, the one that was filled out by Detective Padilla --
Victor Alvarez: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: -- that would be the form that he used to designate by number the various items that were seized; is that correct?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And he indicated that the contents of that one bag were 304?
Victor Alvarez: Right.
Mr. Sanger: All right. He did not designate it 304-A or B, correct?
Victor Alvarez: Not at that time.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, I think you've told us -- and I don't want to be redundant, but I think I asked you about your training and experience when you were on the stand previously --
Victor Alvarez: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: -- is that correct? And I don't know if I went into detail, but let me ask quickly, if I can, you were trained at a police academy; is that right?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Which police academy?
Victor Alvarez: Allan Hancock.
Mr. Sanger: Allan Hancock, all right. That's a POST Academy?
Victor Alvarez: That's right.
Mr. Sanger: And you have also had inservice training; is that correct?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you were also a bailiff in Department 9, or whatever number it was over the years, Judge Lodge's department down in Santa Barbara; is that correct?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: So you had an occasion to see how evidence was handled in court, correct?
Victor Alvarez: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And you had an occasion to see countless witnesses, police officers, detectives, cross-examined with regard to the chain of custody; is that right?
Victor Alvarez: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And in your training and experience, both your POST Academy training and your inservice training and your experience as a police officer or a sheriff, you're aware that chain of custody is important; is that correct?
Victor Alvarez: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And when an item is seized originally by your department, specifically the sheriff's department, it is given a sheriff's booking number, correct?
Victor Alvarez: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And it's put usually into an evidence bag, assuming it's the kind of object that can be put into a bag; is that correct?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: That bag is sealed; is that right?
Victor Alvarez: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And the idea is to come into court and open the bag, and say, “Sure enough, here's the same contents that were put into that bag originally”, right?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: You would agree that it is not a proper police practice to lose an item from a bag; is that right?
Victor Alvarez: This wasn't lost.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. It wasn't here when the item was in front of the jury when you testified originally, was it?
Victor Alvarez: No, it wasn't.
Mr. Sanger: It fell out of the bag?
Victor Alvarez: It was in the box.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Fell out the bag, right?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Objection; argumentative.
The Court: Overruled. Next question.
Mr. Sanger: And you would agree it's not a proper police practice to have things fall out of the bag before you're standing in front of the jury or sitting in front of the jury and introducing the contents of the bag, correct?
Victor Alvarez: Whether it's proper or not, I -- I don't know, but it happened.
Mr. Sanger: When do you believe that somebody gave this item the designation of 304-B?
Victor Alvarez: Originally what happened was at the initial search of Neverland Ranch, all these items were put -- for example, 304, there were more than one item. Later on, as these items were opened, they were given As, Bs and Cs, depending on what was searched and what was found.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Detective Padilla gave it the number 304, correct?
Victor Alvarez: As a group, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Who gave it -- to your knowledge, do you know who actually gave it a designation 304-B?
Victor Alvarez: I'd say it was Detective -- or Sergeant Bonner.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So you were not -- you did not give it the number 304-B; is that correct?
Victor Alvarez: I did not. I gave it the original number, 304.
Mr. Sanger: Did you ever see that item between the time you handed it to Detective Padilla and the time that you found it was in the box?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: When did you see it?
Victor Alvarez: When Sergeant Bonner was itemizing the items.
Mr. Sanger: So you saw him --
Victor Alvarez: This is not the second time I have seen this.
Mr. Sanger: You saw it when Sergeant Bonner actually gave it a designation 304-B?
Victor Alvarez: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then your understanding was it was supposed to be put back in the bag, 304, right, to preserve the chain of custody?
Victor Alvarez: Either in 304 or designated as 304-B in its own container.
Mr. Sanger: In any event, when you took the stand, 304, the bag that you thought contained 304-A and B, only contained A and not B; is that correct?
Victor Alvarez: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Now, this particular item, which you told us is “The Art of Dave Nestler”, is that a book of art by that particular individual?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And that is an item that, to your knowledge, is legal for an adult to purchase commercially, correct?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: I'm not talking about copyrights. What I'm talking about --
Victor Alvarez: Yes, yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- it's something that somebody could buy. If they can find it in a store, right, an adult can buy it? There's nothing illegal about that, right?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And there's nothing illegal about an adult possessing that?
Victor Alvarez: I don't think so.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Thank you. Now, let me just ask you, the second part of your testimony pertained to these videos, and you have related the videos to the DVDs. The actual --
Victor Alvarez: Or the DVDs to the video. Either way, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Am I missing something there?
Victor Alvarez: The DVDs are made from the original videos.
Mr. Sanger: You said you related them. That was my word.
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. On the stand you said these DVDs were taken from these videos, right? That's, in essence, what you're saying?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: There we go. And in that regard, the videos -- your understanding is that these video were located in Bradley Miller's office; is that correct?
Victor Alvarez: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And Bradley Miller is a private investigator that worked for Mark Geragos, correct?
Victor Alvarez: Correct.
Mr. Zonen: Objection; speculative.
The Court: Overruled. The answer is, “Correct”.
Mr. Zonen: Lack of foundation.
The Court: Proceed.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you.
Mr. Sanger: The -- you've looked at the videos, correct?
Victor Alvarez: I have.
Mr. Sanger: And they appear to be surveillance films of some sort, correct?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: They appear to be taken from a public place, a place where a person would lawfully be, a street or sidewalk; is that correct?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And that is consistent with what private investigators do from time to time, correct?
Victor Alvarez: I'm not a private investigator.
Mr. Sanger: No, sir. But you've seen private investigators' surveillance videos before, have you not?
Victor Alvarez: I have.
Mr. Sanger: And sometimes private investigators, for whatever reason, do surveillance videos, correct?
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Thank you. I have no further questions.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: The magazine that's in front of you, I think it's right below your hands at the moment.
Victor Alvarez: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What is the Court number again on that? The one that we've identified as 304-B, sheriff's number?
Victor Alvarez: 822. Exhibit 822.
Mr. Zonen: Where in Neverland did you find that particular exhibit?
Victor Alvarez: This was in --
Mr. Sanger: I'm going to object. That's beyond the scope of direct, actually.
Mr. Zonen: Then I would move to reopen on that question if that's the case.
The Court: It is the case. I'll allow you to reopen.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you.
Mr. Zonen: Where exactly was it that you found that?
Victor Alvarez: This was along with Item 304.
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Victor Alvarez: And it was in the master bedroom downstairs bathroom, next to the sink area by the tub. There's a sink. There's a tub. It was in the middle there.
Mr. Zonen: Was it something that was contained in a drawer or in a suitcase or in any kind of a closed container?
Victor Alvarez: I believe it was out in the open.
Mr. Zonen: It was in the open at the time? Now, you said the magazine wasn't lost, it was in the box. Tell us what you mean by that.
Victor Alvarez: As we brought the exhibits into the courtroom, it was actually placed in one of the boxes that we carried it in. So it just --
Mr. Zonen: And what happened with the magazine?
Victor Alvarez: It was in the box and wasn't presented in court.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Fell out of the -- what was it originally contained in within the box?
Victor Alvarez: If it's labeled 304-B, then it was in plastic and must have just fell out of the plastic.
Mr. Zonen: And did you then retrieve it from the box?
Victor Alvarez: I did.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you. No further questions.
Mr. Sanger: No further questions, Your Honor.
The Court: You may step down.
Mr. Zonen: As to Exhibit No. 822, we would move that into evidence at this time.
Mr. Sanger: I'll submit it.
The Court: It's admitted.
Mr. Zonen: And we'll call Maria Ventura to the stand.
The Court: She's on her way. Counsel, the in-camera hearing that was requested, I think we'll conduct that at about ten minutes before the next break. I think ten minutes is a sufficient amount of time for that in-camera hearing. So that will extend the jurors' lunch by ten minutes and shorten yours by every minute you take over ten. (Laughter.)
Mr. Sneddon: Why are you looking at me, Judge? I have a guilty conscience maybe.
The Court: You must have a guilty conscience.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, could you give us a little more --
The Court: Mr. Mesereau knows.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, oh, oh. I know what it is.
The Court: Come forward, please. When you get to the witness stand, please remain standing. Face the clerk here and raise your right hand.
Message: MARIA A. VENTURA Having been sworn, testified as follows:
Maria Ventura: Yes.
The Clerk: Please be seated. State and spell your name for the record.
The Court: For the attorneys' information, we have two interpreters. I've given them permission to switch off as they need a break. They know when they need to, and so they may do that while you're questioning the witness.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you. May I proceed?
The Court: Yes.
Maria Ventura: Maria A. Ventura.
The Interpreter: May the interpreter spell? Ventura is spelled V-e-n-t-u-r-a.

Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: Miss Ventura, are you the mother of Janet Arvizo?
Maria Ventura: Yes, sir.
Mr. Zonen: Do you have other children as well?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Does Janet Arvizo have children?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And how many children does she have?
Maria Ventura: Three.
Mr. Zonen: All right. These are the three children from her marriage with David Arvizo?
Maria Ventura: Yes, sir.
Mr. Zonen: Does she have a child also with her marriage to Jay Jackson?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And that child is how old?
Maria Ventura: The little one?
Mr. Zonen: Yes, the little one.
Maria Ventura: Eight months.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Now, the three older children, the children who are the children of Janet and David Arvizo --
Maria Ventura: Yes, sir.
Mr. Zonen: -- are their names Davellin, Star and Gavin?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And those three are your grandchildren?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you talk with those three children on a regular basis?
Maria Ventura: Well, they're my kids.
Mr. Zonen: Does that mean yes, you do?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And do the children speak enough Spanish that they're able to communicate effectively with you?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: I'd like to direct your attention back to the early --
Maria Ventura: You can speak louder, because I can't hear. I can't hear.
Mr. Zonen: I would like to direct your attention back to the early part of 2003, January and February of 2003.
Maria Ventura: That's fine.
Mr. Auchincloss: It's not you. It's the interpreter.
Mr. Zonen: I was wondering why --
Maria Ventura: What did you say?
Mr. Zonen: That's what happens when trials go on long enough.
Mr. Zonen: Miss Ventura, can you hear me now?
Maria Ventura: Yes, I do. It was for her.
Mr. Zonen: I understand. (Laughter.)
Mr. Zonen: I would like to direct your attention back to the early part of 2003.
Maria Ventura: That's fine.
Mr. Zonen: Were you aware as to where your daughter and her three children were visiting during that period of time?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And where was that?
Maria Ventura: Neverland. I can't say it very well, but there, Neverland.
Mr. Zonen: Is Neverland a place where you had once visited?
Maria Ventura: Never.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know what Neverland was prior to that time of January and February and March of 2003?
Maria Ventura: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know who Michael Jackson was prior to February of 2003?
Maria Ventura: No.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know who Michael Jackson is today?
Maria Ventura: We all know, because you see it on T.V.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Now, did you ever see a documentary on television that was titled “Living with Michael Jackson”?
Maria Ventura: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever see anything on T.V. that featured your grandchildren, where your grandchildren were shown on television?
Maria Ventura: No. I only see parts of it in the Mexican channel, because those are the channels I watch.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever see any shots at all of your grandchildren on television?
Maria Ventura: Lately, just little clips, short little clips on 52 and 34.
Mr. Zonen: Did you become aware of the fact that your grandchildren had been featured on television in a documentary?
Maria Ventura: No.
Mr. Zonen: At some point in time, did you have a number of reporters or press who came to your home?
Maria Ventura: Oh, yes. My door, my mailbox. They opened my mailbox.
The Interpreter: Okay, okay. (Laughter.)
Maria Ventura: They even opened my mailbox. They yelled at me. I even had to call the police several times. They parked everywhere. The worst ones were the 52, Channel 52. The light was so bright they seemed like a soccer field. The police came and told them to take that away. And that reporter, she said no, because she had to do a report. Another police officer came and he did make them to turn it off, and then they -- six o'clock p.m., they turned it on again.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know what it was that caused all of these reporters to come to your home?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What was it?
Maria Ventura: The participation of that man, the involvement of that man.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you --
Maria Ventura: They wanted to find out what I knew from new talk, but I didn't know anything. I found out later when I watched all those reports, all those newscasts, everything.
Mr. Zonen: At some point in time, did your children come to your home from Neverland?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you do something to facilitate their coming to your home, to cause them to come to your home?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Maria Ventura: I had to lie and say that I was ill so that they could come.
Mr. Zonen: Who did you --
Maria Ventura: Because those children love me very much, because I raised them.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. The children specifically, who was it who you told that you were sick?
Maria Ventura: The truth is I don't remember. The one thing I know is that my children called me.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; nonresponsive.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Was it --
Mr. Mesereau: Move to strike.
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: Move to strike.
The Court: It wasn't stated, so it doesn't need to be stricken.
Mr. Zonen: Was it one of your grandchildren who called you?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember which of the three?
Maria Ventura: No.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember if it was one of the boys as opposed to Davellin?
Maria Ventura: Yes. Yes. I don't remember if it was Gavin or Star.
Mr. Zonen: Did you tell that grandchild that you were sick?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
The Interpreter: I'm sorry, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Why did you do that?
Maria Ventura: So that they could come.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Were you, in fact, sick at the time?
Maria Ventura: No. Well, no. Well, yes, actually, because I do have arthritis and thyroid problems and things.
Mr. Zonen: All right.
Maria Ventura: High cholesterol. I mean, I can make you a longer list. (Laughter.)
Mr. Zonen: It's not necessary. Did they, in fact, come, the three children?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know if it was the same day or at a subsequent time, at a later time?
Maria Ventura: They called me in the afternoon. Later in the afternoon they called me and they said, “Mom” --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled. You may complete your answer.
Maria Ventura: They call me “mom”, because they do call me “mom”, so they asked me if I was sick. And I said yes, because I was -- I was desperate and I was anguished because I hadn't seen them, and I would get a heart attack from not seeing them.
Mr. Zonen: And did they arrive that day or soon thereafter?
Maria Ventura: The following day, I believe, is when they came.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Do you know who it was who delivered them to the house?
Maria Ventura: No. Because my house is like this, the entrance is right here, so they had to walk.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did they come into the home, the three children?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: This is your El Monte home, the home in El Monte?
Maria Ventura: Yes. My house.
Mr. Zonen: The person who -- how long have you lived in that house?
Maria Ventura: 36 years.
Mr. Zonen: And your husband --
Maria Ventura: Approximately. More or less.
Mr. Zonen: Your husband's name is what, please?
Maria Ventura: David.
Mr. Zonen: And David has been married to you for how many years?
Maria Ventura: He's been my only boyfriend and my only husband and he's still with me.
Mr. Zonen: How old were you when you met him?
Maria Ventura: 20. 20.
Mr. Zonen: And David does what kind of work?
Maria Ventura: He's a trucker.
Mr. Zonen: And he has worked in that capacity for how long?
Maria Ventura: His whole life, since I met him.
Mr. Zonen: Is he still working?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And he's still a trucker?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: For which company does he work?
Maria Ventura: I'm not -- I'm going to say it, but I don't know if it's right. Ralph's?
Mr. Zonen: A grocery store chain?
Maria Ventura: Yes, the markets.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Going back to when the three children arrived at your house, did you see the person who drove them to the house?
Maria Ventura: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did that person walk them to the door?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Maria Ventura: Why are you saying that?
Mr. Zonen: Did that person --
Maria Ventura: No, I'm saying him. Why does he say to wait? Is it --
Mr. Zonen: Because he can. (Laughter.)
Maria Ventura: I'm sorry.
The Court: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: Let me change the question.
Mr. Zonen: Did you see at any time the person or persons who delivered your three children to your home?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know who the person was who delivered the children to the house?
Maria Ventura: Miguel's people.
Mr. Zonen: Is “Miguel” Michael Jackson?
Maria Ventura: Yes. It's “Miguel” in Spanish.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you. Miss Ventura, when your children came into the house, was your daughter Janet and her then boyfriend Jay at your home at the time that the three grandchildren arrived?
Maria Ventura: No. I received them by myself.
Mr. Zonen: At some time later that day or at another day, did Janet and Jay arrive at your home?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Maria Ventura: Yes, they came later.
Mr. Zonen: Was it the same day or a different day?
Maria Ventura: Yes. The same day.
Mr. Zonen: The same day. All right. Would you describe for us how the children were behaving at the time that they arrived from Neverland?
Maria Ventura: Those children that came were not my grandkids.
Mr. Zonen: Explain that to us, please.
Maria Ventura: The -- their entire life, my grandkids and I were very close. Their happiness, their sadness, their games, all of that. I was always very important for all three of them. When they came back, they didn't talk to me the same way. They were different kids. And -- and even up till now Gavin is not the same child.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Nonresponsive; move to strike.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Zonen: After the three children returned from Neverland to your home, did you receive any phone calls at your home?
Maria Ventura: Many. Many, many. Day and night. I had a red telephone, and it had a square like that. And in that little square sometimes it said “Neverland”, and some other time “Frank”, or I don't know. And the voice would say, “Gavin, Star, Davellin, somebody answer”.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; nonresponsive.
The Court: Excuse me. Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Could you actually hear messages being left on your phone?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Were there -- was -- were there voices on the messages asking for your grandchildren?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. Just a moment.
Maria Ventura: Yes.
The Court: Have you offered her some water? I'm -- Yourself too, if you --
The Interpreter: I have my bottle. Thank you.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Zonen: Could you tell if it was one voice or more than one voice leaving messages on the phone?
Maria Ventura: Sometimes it said on there “Neverland”.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Maria Ventura: And some other times it was that Frank. What really hurts me is that my granddaughter erased it. Otherwise -- she always liked to -- well, one of the phones broke down, and she tried to make, out of two phones, make one.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; nonresponsive.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: All right. The latter part of the answer, Your Honor, you're referring to?
The Court: We'll leave the first two sentences in.
Mr. Zonen: You told us what you were able to see on the screen on the phone, and you told us you were also able to hear a voice.
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Is that your --
Maria Ventura: Yes. The phone had a little square, and then you could hear the person talk.
Mr. Zonen: All right.
Maria Ventura: And I never allowed the kids to pick up the phone because I was always watching out for that. You know, I would also get calls very late at night, maybe thinking that I was asleep. But ever since that time when they came, when they were no longer the same kids, I couldn't sleep anymore because I was always watching out for that phone.
Mr. Zonen: Let me ask you some questions about the messages. Were the messages always left in English?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Were you able to understand the messages?
Maria Ventura: No. What I understood is as soon as I saw “Neverland” --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; nonresponsive.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: What were you able to understand of the messages?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Zonen: It's not for the truth of the matter.
The Court: I'll allow the question.
Maria Ventura: What I understood is that it said “Neverland” and that they were calling my grandkids. That's what I understood.
Mr. Zonen: You were able to hear the names of the kids being called?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Could you tell if it was the same voice each time or if it was a different voice?
Maria Ventura: The same one.
Mr. Zonen: Give us a sense of how many times this person called.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Maria Ventura: The number of times I can't tell you, but I know that it was very often.
Mr. Zonen: Over what period of time did the calls continue? In other words, was it over days, over weeks, or months? How would describe the length of time that the calls continued?
Maria Ventura: A long time. I couldn't tell you days or whatever, because I just -- I didn't keep track of days, hours. And I watched my grandkids until my daughter took them, took the boys. And Davellin stayed with me.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever become aware of the fact that there were people watching you?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Maria Ventura: All around my house there was a lot of cars. There was a lot of people.
Mr. Zonen: Did anybody ever come to the door and attempt to contact you or the children?
Maria Ventura: Many people came to the door of my house. Cameras. I was -- I was hiding. I was almost like a prisoner. I had to hide. I couldn't even stick my face out like that, because everybody would just come on, come on over.
Mr. Zonen: Within a week or two after your grandchildren returned to your home, did anybody come to the door, knock on the door, and inquire about the children?
Maria Ventura: Yes. All the time. All the time.
Mr. Zonen: Anybody throw stones at your house?
Maria Ventura: Yes. Once. I'm speaking slow so that you can be talking. I was sitting down watching the soap operas, because I'm always watching my soap operas. That T.V. I have in the dining room. Davellin sleeps -- or used to sleep in the bedroom that goes out -- that's out to the street. But sitting like this, here's the dining room and there was her bedroom. But I was sitting down when I heard, “bbrrr”, something like that.
Mr. Zonen: (To the interpreter) That was well done. (Laughter.)
Maria Ventura: But I thought to myself, well, it must be the kids just out in the street. But, no, then again, and again. And then by the third time is when I stood up --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Nonresponsive and narrative.
The Court: Narrative; sustained.
Mr. Zonen: What did you then do?
Maria Ventura: I stood up and I walked around. And Davellin just rushed out of the bedroom, and she asked me, “Mama” -- “Mom, did you hear that?” So I told her, “Yes, somebody's throwing rocks at the house”. We both went up to the door. And when we went out like that, we saw a man standing next to the car. It was a small car. I don't know if it was black or blue, because it was getting late.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Narrative; nonresponsive.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: After you saw the vehicle, did you see the person near the vehicle?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Could you --
Maria Ventura: Right at the time that my granddaughter and I went out, we turned like that, because right at the time, a rock was coming on its way, and it hit right on the window of Davellin's bedroom.
Mr. Zonen: While you were standing watching?
Maria Ventura: Yes. Right at the time that we went out, like that.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Narrative; nonresponsive.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Perhaps we could get the translation of the last -- I don't know if the interpreter translated the last statement.
The Court: Well, I sustained the objection, narrative, so --
Mr. Zonen: Let me back you up a couple steps.
Mr. Zonen: You actually saw somebody throw a stone?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was it the person standing next to the car?
Maria Ventura: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Can you describe that person for us, as best you can?
Maria Ventura: I know that it was a man that was standing there, and he had a cap. Right at the time that we saw the man, Davellin and I, I told Davellin, “Call the police”.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection, Your Honor. Narrative.
The Court: Sustained as to the last sentence.
Mr. Zonen: Were you standing with Davellin at the time you saw the stone being thrown?
Maria Ventura: When he threw -- when he threw the last rock that I saw that hit Davellin's bedroom window, we were both standing there.
Mr. Zonen: Did you then contact law enforcement?
Maria Ventura: That's when I told Davellin to run and call the police.
Mr. Zonen: Did you --
Maria Ventura: And so that man very quickly got in the car and took off.
Mr. Zonen: And did you, in fact, call the police?
Maria Ventura: No.
Mr. Zonen: May I have just one moment, please, Your Honor?
Maria Ventura: I don't really remember, but, yes.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you, Your Honor. I have no further questions.
Mr. Mesereau: No questions, Your Honor.
Maria Ventura: But the other day --
The Court: Thank you. There are no other questions. You may step down.
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry, Your Honor, I need to call the next witness. I neglected to do that. Your Honor, we will not be needing the interpreter any further. Who's doing this, you or Bob?
Mr. Mesereau: Bob.
The Court: Counsel, maybe you'd like to take this moment to explain the scheduling issue that you were going to raise while we're waiting for the witness.
Mr. Sneddon: Approach the bench?
The Court: No, it's all right. You can just tell us. Go ahead and tell us. I mean, it's not a private matter.
Mr. Sneddon: I think it is, because it involves some evidentiary issues.
Bailiff Cortez: Your microphone, sir.
The Court: All right. Approach the bench. (Discussion held off the record at sidebar.)
The Court: Please remain standing. Face the clerk and raise your right hand.

Mr. Zonen: The area where you searched was what, please?
William Caldwell: It was the office of Bradley Miller, a private investigator in Beverly Hills, California.
Mr. Zonen: And do you remember the address?
William Caldwell: I don't. 211 South Beverly Drive, No. 108, I believe.
Mr. Zonen: Very good. In Beverly Hills?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Can you tell us at approximately what time you conducted that search?
William Caldwell: At approximately 9:30 in the morning.
Mr. Zonen: And how many of you went to conduct that search?

Mr. Zonen: The three of you. And did you have any uniformed officers with you at that time?
William Caldwell: Yes. Officer Roy Tinkler from the Beverly Hills Police Department.
Mr. Zonen: When you arrived at that location, was anybody at the office?
William Caldwell: No, sir.
Mr. Zonen: Was the office closed and locked?
William Caldwell: Yes, it was.
Mr. Zonen: Were you able to gain entry into the office?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And how were you able to do that?
William Caldwell: We contacted the property manager who ran the building, and she provided a key for entrance into the outer door of the office.
Mr. Zonen: And did that get you through the outer door into the office?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you at some time, either prior to or after gaining entry into the outer door, make an effort to contact Brad Miller?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And how did you do that?
William Caldwell: I previously obtained Mr. Miller's cell phone number and I tried to call it and I left a message on his voice mail on the cell phone.
Mr. Zonen: Were you able to get ahold of him?

Mr. Zonen: Did you attempt to gain entry into the inner doors in the office?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: How many inner doors were there?
William Caldwell: A total of three.
Mr. Zonen: And where did they lead to?
William Caldwell: One of the offices was open. The door led to a secretarial area, and then the other two doors were locked.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Were you able to gain entry into the two rooms that were locked?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: How did you do that?
William Caldwell: Through use of a sledgehammer.
Mr. Zonen: What does that mean?
William Caldwell: We forcibly opened the door by pounding on the door with a sledgehammer.
Mr. Zonen: How were you able do that? What -- kind of give us a sense of what's involved. We've all seen it on T.V., but I don't know that we've ever --
Mr. Sanger: I'm going to object. Relevance, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Sustained as to the entirety of that question or just the comments at the end?
The Court: The entirety.
Mr. Zonen: Did you gain entry into that office?
William Caldwell: Yes, sir.
Mr. Zonen: And what were the two rooms that you gained entry into?
William Caldwell: One of the offices was the office of Bradley Miller, the private investigator, and the second room was a conference room.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you seize a number of items from that location?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you have something to do with the documentation of the items that were seized?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Tell me what your role was in that.
William Caldwell: My role was to complete the property form at the scene. Detective Forney would bring me the items, and I would number them and list the items on a property form, and put them in bags, and number the bags.
Mr. Zonen: Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Mr. Zonen: I would like to show you three exhibits currently marked for identification No. 831, 832, and 833. If I may approach the witness, Your Honor.
The Court: You may.
Mr. Zonen: If you would look at those three photographs and please tell us what they are.
William Caldwell: Exhibit 831 is a photograph of a cabinet with a television and VCR and a number of video and audiotapes. Exhibit 832 is a blow-up of some audio tapes. And Exhibit 833 is a blow-up of some VHS video cassette tapes.
Mr. Zonen: Now, the audiotapes and the videotapes, the VHS tapes that you can see in 832 and 833, are they also visible in 831?
William Caldwell: Yes, sir.
Mr. Zonen: And can you describe in that photograph where they are?
William Caldwell: They're located on a shelf above the VCR, which is standing on top of the television.
Mr. Zonen: Were items seized from that general location --
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: -- as depicted in 831?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And among the items that were seized, can you just describe what they were, please?
William Caldwell: Videotapes and audiotapes.
Mr. Zonen: I'd like to now show you a series of tapes, if I can. If I could approach the witness with all of them.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Zonen: I would like to show you, if I can, Exhibit No. 823, and that is Court Exhibit 823.
William Caldwell: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: Can you tell us what this item is?
William Caldwell: It's a videotape. It's entitled, “Arvizo 2-19 and 2-21”. And it says, “Re MJ”. And it's my Evidence Item No. 811. It was seized from this cabinet that I've talked about earlier.
Mr. Zonen: And who was it who actually seized it from the cabinet?
William Caldwell: Detective Rod Forney.
Mr. Zonen: Did you see it in the cabinet?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Court Exhibit No. 824, please. Take a look at that, Court Exhibit No. 824, and tell us what that is.
William Caldwell: It's a VHS cassette tape. It's entitled, “To Brad Re Arvizo”. It's my evidence Item No. 812. And it was seized from the top shelf, as indicated in the photo.
Mr. Zonen: No. 825, please, Court Exhibit No. 825, tell us what that is.
William Caldwell: This is a VHS video cassette tape. It's entitled, “Arvizo Move, 3-5-3. MJJ”. And it's my Evidence Item No. 815. And this, as well, was seized from that same location, the cabinet above the television.
Mr. Zonen: Showing you Item 826, please.
William Caldwell: This is a VHS video cassette tape. It's entitled, “To Brad, Jeanette, March, Johnny”. There's a phone number, “1-866-256-6275”. And it's marked, the other side, “MJJ, Arvizo, 2003”. It's my Evidence Item No. 816. And it was seized from the location as indicated, the cabinet above the television.
Mr. Zonen: Item 827, Court Exhibit Item 827, tell us what that is.
William Caldwell: This is an audio cassette tape. It's marked “MJ” or labeled “MJ”. It's my Evidence Item No. 817. And it was seized on that same shelf above the television.
Mr. Zonen: Court Exhibit No. 828, please tell us what that is.
William Caldwell: This is an audio cassette tape. It's entitled, “Michael Jackson”. It's my Evidence Item No. 818. It's also labeled on the side, “Michael Jackson”, and it says, “Arvizo, ST, MT, 2-16-03”. And it was seized from that same location on the shelf above the television.
Mr. Zonen: Item 829, please tell us what that is.
William Caldwell: This is a mini video cassette tape. It's marked “Arvizo Move”. It's my Evidence Item 819. And it was seized, as well, from the shelf in the television cabinet, the same location.
Mr. Zonen: Now, as the person who we've described previously was the scribe, what was your obligation with regards to those items?
William Caldwell: My obligation was to collect them from Detective Forney, to note the location that he seized the items from, to number the items, and to log the items in on an evidence sheet and to place them in those respective bags and seal them.
Mr. Zonen: And did you do that as to each one of those items?
William Caldwell: I did.
Mr. Zonen: The three photographs that I've handed you, tell us again the court exhibit number of those.
William Caldwell: 831 is a photograph depicting the cabinet and the television, the VCR and the tapes on the top shelf. Exhibit No. 832 is a blow-up or an enhancement of the audio cassette tapes. And Court Exhibit 833 is a blow-up or enhancement of the video, VHS tapes.
Mr. Zonen: The content of those three photographs, are they accurately depicted in those photographs?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: I would move to introduce into evidence 831, 832 and 833.
Mr. Sanger: No objection.
The Court: They're admitted.
Mr. Zonen: I have no further questions.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: Sergeant Caldwell.
William Caldwell: Mr. Sanger.
Mr. Sanger: How are you?
William Caldwell: Very well, sir. Thank you.
Mr. Sanger: Good. You've been a detective for how many years total?
William Caldwell: 16 or 17 years.
Mr. Sanger: So 27 years in the sheriff's department, correct?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: 16 or 17 of those as a detective, correct?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Four years as the detective sergeant in charge of the Carpinteria substation or what's now called the Coastal Station, correct?
William Caldwell: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sanger: And Vic -- Victor Alvarez is a detective who works under your supervision; is that correct?
William Caldwell: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sanger: And your assignment in this case came from whom?
William Caldwell: Well, initially from Lieutenant Kitzmann and Lieutenant Klapakis.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So the two lieutenants, Kitzmann and Klapakis, assigned you, in essence, to be a scribe on the search of Brad Miller's office; is that correct?
William Caldwell: Well, they didn't make that individual assignment. I made that assignment to myself.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Let's put it this way: They assigned you to go do the Brad Miller search in this case; is that correct?
William Caldwell: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sanger: Did they assign you, with your background and experience, to do anything else in this case other than the Brad Miller search?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: What else?
William Caldwell: A search of a storage locker in West Los Angeles.
Mr. Sanger: All right. That was related to the Brad Miller search; is that correct?
William Caldwell: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So other than the Brad Miller search and that spin-off, you were not assigned to do anything else in this investigation relating to Mr. Jackson; is that correct?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Now, with regard to the location that you searched, you understood that to be the office of a private investigator; is that correct?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you knew, before you went in, that Bradley Miller was the owner of the premises or was the person whose offices you were searching, correct?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you knew Bradley Miller was, in fact, a licensed private investigator, correct?
William Caldwell: I was told that, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And had somebody else done some background work on that and presented you with it?
William Caldwell: I believe that information was contained in the search warrant affidavit, yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And at the time you searched, did you know who Bradley Miller was working for? Of your knowledge, did you know who he was working for?
William Caldwell: I -- at one point I was told that he worked for Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And later you found out he worked for Mr. Geragos, correct?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, Mr. Geragos, at the time and currently, was a prominent lawyer in Beverly Hills; is that correct?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And Bradley Miller had an office in Beverly Hills, correct?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: During the course of the search, you determined that there was a connection between Mr. Geragos and Bradley Miller, correct?
William Caldwell: When you say “connection” I'm not clear on the question, sir.
Mr. Sanger: Well, let's put it this way: In all your experience in law enforcement, you're aware that private investigators often work for lawyers, correct?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And in the course of your doing your search, you ran across correspondence indicating that there was a connection between Mark Geragos and Bradley Miller, correct?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, you mentioned that on one of the tapes there, there was a reference -- maybe more than one, but at least one of the tapes there's a reference to, quote, “Michael Jackson” --
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- correct? You're familiar with the manner in which private investigators work, to a certain extent, correct?
William Caldwell: To a certain extent, yes.
Mr. Sanger: You've never been one?
William Caldwell: No, sir.
Mr. Sanger: All right. But you have certainly dealt with a lot of private investigators during your career, correct?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And a lot of your colleagues in years gone by, who retired from law enforcement, have become private investigators, correct?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And private investigators, when they're working for a lawyer, are usually assigned to work on a particular case; is that correct?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And often they will give the name of their -- the client of the lawyer -- let me withdraw that. Often the name of the lawyer's client will be the designation that they will place on their materials; is that correct?
William Caldwell: My answer would be a guess. I don't know one way or the other.
Mr. Sanger: It's not unusual for people on either side of the -- of the matter, either a private investigator working for a defense lawyer or law enforcement, to refer to, for instance, “the Smith case”, am I right?
William Caldwell: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: So you'd refer to matters pertaining to an investigation relating to Mr. Smith as being “the Smith matter”, right?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. That does not, in and of itself, imply that Mr. Smith had any particular control or direction over anything that --
Mr. Zonen: I would object to this as speculative and beyond the scope of this witness's expertise.
Mr. Sanger: I didn't finish the question, but the Court got the gist of it, I suppose.
The Court: Go ahead and finish.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Let me try to start it over.
Mr. Sanger: The fact that, for instance, hypothetically, based on your training and experience, the name “Smith” appeared on a file or a videotape, or something of that sort, would not necessarily mean that Mr. Smith had any control or direction with regard to what the private investigator is doing; is that correct?
The Court: I'll sustain the objection.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Very well. No further questions.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: You mentioned the presence of an affidavit. Was that an affidavit to a search warrant?
William Caldwell: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And did you have that search warrant with you?
William Caldwell: I had the search warrant with me, yes, sir.
Mr. Zonen: And had you reviewed the affidavit prior to the execution of the search?
William Caldwell: I did.
Mr. Zonen: That was a search warrant authorized by a judge in Santa Barbara County; is that correct?
William Caldwell: Correct.
Mr. Zonen: No further questions.
Mr. Sanger: I'm going to move to strike the last question and answer, Your Honor, as beyond the scope of direct and irrelevant.
The Court: It is beyond the scope, but I'll allow the question. Do you want any examination on the issue?
Mr. Sanger: No, Your Honor. That's fine.
The Court: All right. Thank you. You may step down.
Mr. Zonen: We'll call Detective Rod Forney to the stand.
The Court: You know, we're just going to start -- in a couple minutes we're going to start the in-camera hearing, so have the next witness available at quarter to 12:00.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you.
The Court: We'll excuse you a little early for lunch; be in a few minutes. The nature of the hearing that we're going to have is going to be in camera, in chambers, and I'll have the court reporter and an attorney from each side come back. And Mr. Jackson may attend or may not attend, as you deem -- whatever you request, Mr. Mesereau.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. (Whereupon, proceedings were held in chambers and, having been ordered sealed by the Court, are omitted herefrom.)
Message: The following proceedings were held in open court outside the presence and hearing of the jury:
The Court: Mr. Sneddon, you had indicated you had a scheduling issue you wanted to raise outside the presence of the jury?
Mr. Sneddon: I do.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, there are several issues I want to address the Court on, and some of it is going to be some good news for the Court and some of it is going to be bad news for the Court, or end up being bad news for me, one or the other. But in any case, I wanted to alert the Court to several issues. The first one that I want to alert the Court to is, for scheduling purposes, that we believe, under our estimation, that we will probably be completing our evidence by the end of next week, so that the defense is prepared to know that that's -- we estimate we will be done by the end of next week. The second issue involves -- I wanted to alert the Court, because I had a conversation with the attorney from Las Vegas last night, that one of the witnesses who you signed an order of transportation on, Mr. Carter, who is scheduled to be here either Thursday or Friday, that the lawyer indicated to me that he was going to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights with regard to the charges which are currently pending against him in Nevada. And that raises several issues to the Court, and to us personally, with regard to his testimony. And I thoroughly intended to have for the Court this morning a memorandum of the issues involved. And the reason I don't is because Mr. Franklin's computer blew up, and playing around with it trying to get the two documents that I had prepared and should have been here this morning and filed by 8:30 didn't -- aren't done yet. And my last estimate is they're working on the computer to free up the stuff that's in there. I don't understand it, but a 15-year-old teenager probably does. So in any case, those were issues I wanted to bring to the Court's attention that are issues before Mr. Carter testifies. And that's why I had the order changed from Thursday to Friday. In addition to that, there are several outstanding issues that we're going to ask -- one of the other things that we were going to file at 8:30 this morning was to calendar with the clerk a hearing, like we did on the 1108, that it's now time, since Mrs. Arvizo has testified, to revisit the issues the Court postponed on the testimony of the domestic violence expert that we filed briefs on and counsel for the defendant filed briefs on. And so before we can go forward on that front, we need to get some rulings from the Court on that, as well as, the Court knows, the issue that I filed and you asked that counsel for the defense did a brief yesterday on Mr. Abdool. So that's a long way of saying that the good news is, I believe that we're about to the point where we can close off our case next week. The bad news, which I was saving for last, is I don't think we have enough witnesses to complete this week. And I'm very concerned about our ability to bring anybody in on Friday particularly. And the reason for that is that a lot of the witnesses that are on for next week are people who are coming from -- involve telephone records and things of that nature, which we had to give advance warning and are not local people. And we had to line it up in terms of their transportation and in terms of their ability to stay in order to try not to spend extra money having people fly and cancel trips and pay penalties on flights and stuff like that. And we believe that we can put all of those people on on Tuesday. We'll have witnesses on Monday. But I believe that -- that also, like I said, we can't go forward on some of these until we get some rulings. And the last thing is that we want to look at those disks, because that could impact what we do in the future. And not having had an opportunity to look at those and it's not simply something that we can simply turn over to investigators and say, “Look at these things”, I think we, as the lawyers involved in the case, are going to need an opportunity to do that. So I guess what I'm telling the Court is that -- that we will be able to go forward as the Court has asked us to in the past, and that's consecutively with witnesses, but I believe on Friday that we will have a very difficult time rustling up anybody for that date. We did not anticipate certain things that have happened in this courtroom today or yesterday, and so that's where we are. And that's the status on everything. And as you know, we've only -- one time since we started our case did we finish early. So I think we've followed the spirit, if not the letter, of the Court's rulings. And I think we just have reached a point where trying to get the caboose in line for the finish has been a little more difficult than keeping the train on track to this point.
The Court: Do you have enough witnesses for tomorrow morning?
Mr. Sneddon: At this particular point in time, we believe we do. It will be close, but I think, you know, the Court wanted us to get that three hours in, so -- but it's a local witness. So if you were contemplating something else, I could push that witness off to the next day or something.
The Court: Well, I think the jurors would be happier with a three-day weekend than with an interruption in the middle of the week. I don't know that, but I think so.
Mr. Sneddon: I agree with you.
The Court: So then the -- so, Mr. Mesereau, before I start saying anything, do you want to be heard?
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, we plan to call a lot of witnesses and we could run into some scheduling problems and we may be asking for some consideration, so I think the least we could do is be considerate in this regard. Because I think anytime you're putting on a lengthy case, you can run into scheduling difficulties. So --
The Court: Are you saying that you sympathize with Mr. Sneddon? (Laugher.)
Mr. Mesereau: I believe -- I think we should take Friday off, Your Honor.
The Court: How about the motions? I think the domestic violence one, we have all the material. I just needed to know where we were. You may want to make some additional points on that, each side, before I rule. But as far as the written work done, it's done, I think.
Mr. Mesereau: And there are some other issues, Your Honor, I think, like the motion Miss Yu filed, which is important to our case.
The Clerk: Can't hear, Judge.
The Court: They can't hear you in the back.
Mr. Mesereau: The motion that Miss Yu filed dealing with examination on sexual conduct --
The Court: Oh, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: -- is an important one to us.
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, could I give you two other things to factor into your contemplation?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: We anticipate filing, no later than tomorrow morning, two other motions for reconsideration on issues that the Court's addressed. They're short, brief motions, but we've almost got them finished.
The Court: All right. Well, I think the way that I would like to handle it, then, would be that we take whatever evidence you have -- today, how much evidence do you have for today?
Mr. Sneddon: How much we have today, Your Honor? I think -- I think we'll probably finish the day out.
The Court: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: I wasn't short today. I mean, we could get ten minutes short or something, but I think we'll be here the rest of the day.
The Court: Let's finish the day out with evidence. And then what I would do is, if we finish early with evidence on Thursday, we'll start the motions. I think we could all do with Friday off, so if we can hear -- if we can get to the end of the evidence and still have the motions before Friday, that would be a good thing, so let's make that our goal.
Mr. Sneddon: I can arrange that, Judge. I can drop one witness off the bottom.
The Court: You can do that?
Mr. Sneddon: I can do that, Your Honor.
The Court: Okay. So let's do that. Let's figure that we'll use today, tomorrow, and -- half of tomorrow and Thursday, and we'll go dark Friday, but we'll have the motions done before we leave. That's a condition.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
The Court: We will hear the motions before Friday.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: All right.

Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: Detective Forney.
Rod Forney: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: How are you?
Rod Forney: Fine, thank you.
Mr. Sanger: Good. How long have you been a detective?
Rod Forney: Approximately five years.
Mr. Sanger: And how long have you been a deputy sheriff?
Rod Forney: A deputy sheriff for 11 years total.
Mr. Sanger: Eleven total including the five as a detective?
Rod Forney: Yes, and then another 14 as a police officer.
Mr. Sanger: And with what department?
Rod Forney: Bakersfield Police Department.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Did you have assignments there other than patrol?
Rod Forney: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sanger: Were you assigned to detectives at any time?
Rod Forney: I was sort of a street-level vice/narcotics unit and also traffic as a motor officer.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So would you just tell us -- that's 20-some years anyway?
Rod Forney: 25 years.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And you were assigned to work on the case regarding Mr. Jackson; is that correct?
Rod Forney: Yes, I was.
Mr. Sanger: And your assignment was to go to the premises of Bradley Miller in Beverly Hills and execute a search warrant; is that right?
Rod Forney: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Were you assigned to do anything other than that?
Rod Forney: No.
Mr. Sanger: All right. You're familiar -- based on your training, you've had training through a POST academy, I take it, right?
Rod Forney: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then you've had inservice training at two different departments you work at, right?
Rod Forney: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you would agree that chain of custody is a pretty important aspect of handling evidence; is that correct?
Rod Forney: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And that's what we have all these bags for with tape on them and initials and dates and all that; is that correct?
Rod Forney: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Mr. Zonen made a remark about something falling out of a bag. You want the evidence to be in the bag that it was put in so that you can show that there is a chain of custody, correct?
Rod Forney: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And so you wouldn't want to, for instance, find a random piece of evidence at the bottom of a box that fell out of its bag, would you?
Rod Forney: No.
Mr. Sanger: All right. All right. Now, let me just ask you a question or two about the pictures that were up on the board, and I won't put them back up. But basically, when you did this search, you realized you were searching a private investigator's office; is that correct?
Rod Forney: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: In the course of searching that office, you found things that seemed to be consistent with this being an office of a private investigator; is that correct?
Rod Forney: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: There were -- there was office equipment and computers, correct?
Rod Forney: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And there were -- there were videotapes --
Rod Forney: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- is that correct? There were audiotapes?
Rod Forney: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: There were tapes other than the tapes that you seized in this particular investigation; is that correct?
Rod Forney: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And you would agree there's nothing unusual about investigators having surveillance tapes; is that correct?
Rod Forney: That's correct. Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Okay. Thank you. No further questions.
Mr. Zonen: Oh, I have no further questions.
The Court: Thank you. You may step down.
Mr. Sneddon: Michael Davy. He should be outside.
The Court: For the jury, during our last hearing you weren't present for, we decided to not have court on Friday. So we've worked long and hard, a lot of days in a row, and the District Attorney has told us that he expects to end his case probably by the end of next week. So, considering some issues that we have to decide in your absence, we're all going to take Friday off, not just you. So, remember, there won't be court tomorrow afternoon, and there won't be court Friday now. Come forward.
Mr. Zonen: Mr. Davy, go right up to the front, please.
Bailiff Cortez: Remain standing. Face the clerk. Raise your right hand.

The Clerk: Thank you.
Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. SNEDDON:
Mr. Sneddon: Mr. Davy, we're going to need you to scoot up closer to that microphone, if you can. It's been a constant problem. But you have to lean into it so everybody can hear what you have to say, okay?
Michael Davy: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: You're retired, are you not?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what did you do before you were lucky enough to retire?
Michael Davy: I worked for the Los Angeles City School District as a teacher, a counselor and an administrator.
Mr. Sneddon: For how long were you employed by the school district?
Michael Davy: 32 years.
Mr. Sneddon: During the time that you worked for the school district, were you at some point in time assigned to John Burroughs?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what grades does John Burroughs cover?
Michael Davy: Sixth, seventh and eighth.
Mr. Sneddon: So it's three years, then?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Sneddon: And what is the size of the school, approximately, when you were there?
Michael Davy: When I was there it was about 2400.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the year 2002 - okay? - the school year 2002-2003 - all right? - what were your assignments at John Burroughs?
Michael Davy: I was a grade-level counselor.
Mr. Sneddon: And for how long did you -- were you assigned that responsibility?
Michael Davy: I worked there about -- I worked there five years, and I was in that assignment for about three and a half years.
Mr. Sneddon: At some point during the school year of 2002-2003, were you reassigned some other responsibilities within John Burroughs?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what were your -- what was your new assignment?
Michael Davy: I became an administrator in charge of attendance.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, let's go back to the first one. You were a counselor?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you also have teaching responsibilities?
Michael Davy: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Full-time counselor?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And how many other counselors were there in the school; do you recall?
Michael Davy: Yes. There's one for each grade level, and there was a special needs counselor, so there was three -- a total of four counselors.
Mr. Sneddon: During the time that you were a counselor and working at John Burroughs, did you meet two students by the name of Gavin Arvizo and Star Arvizo?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you meet their mother?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall her name?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What was that?
Michael Davy: Janet Ventura.
Mr. Sneddon: So she was known to you as “Janet Ventura”?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Sneddon: And were the boys known to you as “Ventura” or “Arvizo”?
Michael Davy: Arvizo.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at some point in time you were assigned as an administrator, correct?
Michael Davy: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: What are the responsibilities or what were those new responsibilities to you as administrator?
Michael Davy: It was to process students during the enrollment process, and to process them if they were leaving the campus, leaving the school, transferring to another school or school district. And it was also to make monthly reports to the district on our status, our attendance status. And to find out where kids were that were not coming to school.
Mr. Sneddon: At some point during the school year of 2002 and 2003, you transitioned from counselor to administrator, correct?
Michael Davy: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you tell us approximately when that transition occurred?
Michael Davy: Well, the person that I replaced went out on leave, so I was just temporarily filling that person's job in the early parts of January, February, and March. And at some point, that person retired and I took the job permanently.
Mr. Sneddon: So the earliest point would have been January, February, March of 2003?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Let me show you a photograph, if I might. Just take a look at it for a second. I've handed you a photograph that I believe has the number “338” on the tag; is that correct?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And in that photograph, do you recognize anybody in the photograph?
Michael Davy: I recognize Star and Gavin, and I assume the third person is their sister, but I never met her.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. But the two males in the photograph are Star and Gavin?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now I'm going to ask you a few questions about Star and Gavin, okay?
Michael Davy: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: To your knowledge, were they attending John Burroughs during some portion of the school year during 2002-2003?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And during the time that they were at the school, were you a counselor to them?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Or let's take them one at a time. Were you a counselor to Gavin?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Were you a counselor to Star?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: So that would have been what grade?
Michael Davy: Seventh. Seventh grade.
Mr. Sneddon: Seventh. Now, later, when you were in charge of attendance, did it come to your attention that Star and Gavin were not attending school?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And as a result of that information, what did you do? What course of action did you take?
Michael Davy: I notified our pupil services counselor that I was unable to reach the house by phone, and I asked him to go out there and make a home visit.
Mr. Sneddon: Does this gentleman -- is this a male or a female?
Michael Davy: It's a male.
Mr. Sneddon: And what's his name?
Michael Davy: Stephen Coffman.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And did you ever hear back from Mr. Coffman as to whether or not he was able to make contact with the family?
Michael Davy: Yes, he reported back the same day that he was unable to make contact, and that he had left his card there, and that he had talked to neighbors, but was unable to find out where they were.
Mr. Sneddon: At some point after this conversation that you had with Mr. Coffman, did you receive a telephone call from Janet Arvizo?
Michael Davy: I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, let's go back just in point in time. Prior to this telephone call - okay? --
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- had you met Mrs. Arvizo personally?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Mrs. Ventura, I guess, as she was known to you.
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And on how many occasions did you meet Mrs. Ventura?
Michael Davy: Numerous. She came up to school regularly.
Mr. Sneddon: And how would you describe her in terms of her cooperation with you and the school?
Michael Davy: She was very supportive of our efforts.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at the time that you received a telephone call from her after Mr. Coffman had gone out to her house and been unable to locate her - okay? --
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- with regard to that telephone conversation, did you find anything unusual or different about that telephone call with Mrs. Ventura than your previous contacts with her?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague and leading.
The Court: Sustained. Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: On which ground, Your Honor? Just so I know.
The Court: Vague.
Mr. Sneddon: During the course of your conversation with Mrs. Ventura after Mr. Coffman went out to the house, how would you describe her demeanor?
Michael Davy: It wasn't forthcoming.
Mr. Sneddon: Was that unusual, in your opinion?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when the subject -- would you tell us what the subject matter of the conversation was?
Michael Davy: Right, I --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the conversation that you had with Mrs. Ventura - okay? - did it involve the attendance of the kids at school?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And as a result of the conversation with Mrs. Ventura, did you give her some information that was necessary with regard to the kids' future attendance at school?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. What did you tell her?
Michael Davy: I -- they had been gone more than ten days, and I said that I needed her to bring them back to school or check them out. And she said to me that --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, it's offered as circumstantial evidence with regard to her state of mind at this particular point in time.
The Court: The objection is sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. So without telling us what she said, would you tell us what you said to her, what instructions you gave her?
Michael Davy: Right. I told her that I needed the students to either return to school or to check out. And she said it was not --
Mr. Sneddon: You can't tell us what she said.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Sneddon: She said something in response to that, correct?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And then did you say anything back to her?
Michael Davy: I told her we cannot keep the kids in -- on our books as students at the school for any longer than we already had. And that if it was going to be an extended stay, they were going to be gone for a while, they needed to be checked out. And when they were available to come back to school, we would check them back in.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And did you give Mrs. Ventura some directions as to what was necessary to check the children out of school?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Sneddon: Tell us what you told her.
Michael Davy: I asked her to come in and check the students out. She said that wasn't --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. So you asked her to personally come in and do it?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And she said something back to you?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Sneddon: And as a result of that, did you give her further direction as to what procedurally would have to be followed to get those children out of school?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Sneddon: Tell us what you told her.
Michael Davy: I indicated that if she was unable to come, that we needed someone with a note from her, and her driver's license, and that person needed to be able to have an I.D. also. And that we needed the textbooks returned, and to do it quickly, to do it soon.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. At that point in time, did you become aware of the fact that somebody came to check the children out of school?
Michael Davy: Yes. She said that somebody would come in a day or two.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you write a note to somebody to expect this to happen?
Michael Davy: I wrote a note to my secretary that a person would be coming with her I.D. and his I.D. and pay for the books, and to direct that person to the book room to pay for any textbooks that weren't there.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you at some point actually meet somebody who came to check the boys out of school?
Michael Davy: I did.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember the name of that person?
Michael Davy: Yes. It was Mr. Amen. Vincent Amen.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And did you personally deal with him on the check-out procedure?
Michael Davy: The secretary gave him the paperwork and made copies of his I.D. and Miss Ventura's driver's license, and she kept the note that was sent along with him. And, you know, I spoke to him briefly, but I didn't handle the nuts and bolts of it. The secretary did.
Mr. Sneddon: And were some books paid for on that particular occasion?
Michael Davy: Books were paid for, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: By whom?
Michael Davy: By Vincent Amen.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I'm going to show you some exhibits. Counsel, it will be 271 and 272. I want you to take a look at the exhibit that's been marked as 271-A and ask if you recognize that.
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: That exhibit is actually in evidence. And how do you recognize it?
Michael Davy: It's my note to the secretary.
Mr. Sneddon: That's in your handwriting, correct?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What's the date of that note?
Michael Davy: February 5th. I'm sorry, I don't have my glasses on. March 5th.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
Michael Davy: March 5th.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Was that note prepared at the time of -- that date?
Michael Davy: I think it -- I prepared it the day that I had the phone call.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Michael Davy: I had the conversation.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Turn the next page to page B, if you would. Do you recognize page B?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to page B, what is that?
Michael Davy: That's a school form that we use when students check out.
Mr. Sneddon: And for what student is that?
Michael Davy: This is for Gavin Arvizo.
Mr. Sneddon: And does it indicate the destination?
Michael Davy: It does.
Mr. Sneddon: As what?
Michael Davy: Phoenix, Arizona.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's go to C, if we can. And this is 271-C. What is that document?
Michael Davy: It is a note from Miss Arvizo.
Mr. Sneddon: That's a document that you indicated she needed as part of the process if she was going to have somebody else check them out?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And lastly, 271-D, what's that?
Michael Davy: These are copies of Miss Arvizo's -- or Miss Ventura's I.D., driver's license, and Mr. Amen's driver's license.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, let's move to 272, if we can. All we need you to do is just flip this over. Thank you. And 272-A, which is in evidence, what is that?
Michael Davy: It's the check-out sheet for Star Arvizo.
Mr. Sneddon: And is the destination indicated on that also?
Michael Davy: Yes. Phoenix, Arizona.
Mr. Sneddon: And the next page, which would be 272-B?
Michael Davy: It's a note from Miss Ventura to check out Star.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And on the last page, on the back side of that is what?
Michael Davy: That's the school form where the teachers sign the student's check-out form and put a grade there.
Mr. Sneddon: And does that indicate that books were paid for on that form?
Michael Davy: It does.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I'll take that. Thank you. During the time that -- I want to make it more particular, but -- well, during the year -- the school year 2002 and 2003 - okay? - at John Burroughs, was there an instructor there by the name of Mr. Geraldt?
Michael Davy: Yes. Mr. Geraldt, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Geraldt. And how long have you known Mr. Geraldt?
Michael Davy: Five years.
Mr. Sneddon: And had you worked at the same school with him --
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- during that five-year period?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Sneddon: And what was Mr. Geraldt's position with the school?
Michael Davy: He was a classroom teacher, and he also handled the detention room. And in the mornings, he didn't have a home room. He processed students that were late to school.
Mr. Sneddon: Did the manner in which Mr. Geraldt interacted with some of the students and parents at the school cause problems?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: In what respect?
Michael Davy: He had a kind of paramilitary demeanor about him. He was kind of a drill instructor, in your face, you know. Kind of shouty, loud, and, you know, “You need to do this” and -- just aggressive.
Mr. Sneddon: And did that cause problems with some of the students?
Michael Davy: It did.
Mr. Sneddon: Did it cause problems with some of the parents?
Michael Davy: It did.
Mr. Sneddon: And did the school have to take actions towards him to try to calm down his behavior?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at some point -- I didn't ask you this, but I should have. The documents that -- 71 (sic) and 72 (sic) that show that Gavin and Star were checked out of the school, those were completed on the day that the children were checked out?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: That's correct?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: That would have been in March of 2003?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did Gavin and Star come back to John Burroughs later?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember approximately when it was?
Michael Davy: About three weeks later.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, do you recall an incident in which a person by the name of Major Jay Jackson came to contact you?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you know who Major Jay Jackson is?
Michael Davy: I do.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did you first meet Mr. Jay Jackson, Major Jay Jackson?
Michael Davy: I met him in my office when I was having a conference with Gavin's mother, and he attended with her.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, on the particular day when Major Jackson approached you, do you remember approximately when that was in relationship to the kids coming back to school, Gavin and Star?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Tell the jury --
Michael Davy: It was -- it was shortly thereafter. Within a few days or a week.
Mr. Sneddon: And where were you when Major Jackson approached you?
Michael Davy: I was in front of the school.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry?
Michael Davy: In front of John Burroughs.
Mr. Sneddon: And could you describe his demeanor at the time that he approached you?
Michael Davy: All right. He was agitated. He said that there was a --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Sneddon: It's offered to explain the conduct of this witness in response to the information that was provided.
The Court: I'll sustain the hearsay objection.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I don't know if we got an answer to the first part, so I'll just start over again. And don't tell us what Major Jackson told you, okay?
Michael Davy: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you describe his demeanor when he first approached you?
Michael Davy: He was agitated.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And without telling us what he said, did he say something to you --
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- that caused you to do something?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. As a result of the information that you received from Major Jackson, what did you do?
Michael Davy: I went down to the street and approached a car that had a gentleman in it that was videotaping students.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you actually see the camera?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was the camera at the first point that you saw it?
Michael Davy: In the driver's hand.
Mr. Sneddon: And in what direction was it pointed?
Michael Davy: Out the windshield.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, let's pause for just a second, if we can, and go back. At what point in the school day was it that Major Jackson approached you?
Michael Davy: It was dismissal time.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you describe to the jury what it's like at John Burroughs at dismissal time in terms of the traffic flow?
Michael Davy: John Burroughs is situated in a residential area between two major streets. And at dismissal time, the only way out of the school is through the front or the north and south end of the school. You can't exit the back of the school because there's houses back there. So the vast majority of these 2400 kids leave out the front or the side, but they end up in front of school. And there's school buses out there, and there are parents, a lot of parents there to pick up their students. So you have a traffic jam for about 15 or 20 minutes where the traffic flow is very, very slow. Only about five or six cars can go through the light at a time, because the students crossing the street hold up traffic. So it would take you -- it will take you 15 minutes to go from one end of the block to the other at dismissal time.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at the time that you approached this car, do you remember what kind of a car it was?
Michael Davy: Generally, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Tell us.
Michael Davy: It was a Nissan sports car.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was this car in terms of the relationship with this traffic flow at the point?
Michael Davy: It was in gridlock. It was in front of school in the gridlock.
Mr. Sneddon: Were you actually able to go up to the driver of the car?
Michael Davy: Yes. Yeah, that's --
Mr. Sneddon: Did you have a conversation with the driver of the car?
Michael Davy: I walked up to the driver and I told him that he couldn't videotape students. And he -- I said, “I need you to stop videotaping students”. And he said, “Okay”, and set the camera down on the seat or the floor of the car.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you write down the license number of the car?
Michael Davy: I did not.
Mr. Sneddon: Was there any school security available to you on this particular day?
Michael Davy: On that particular day, the school police officer was not present. And I gave him a note the next day describing the car and telling him the situation.
Mr. Sneddon: No further questions.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Good afternoon, Mr. Davy.
Michael Davy: Good afternoon.
Mr. Mesereau: My name is Thomas Mesereau. I speak for Mr. Jackson. When did you first meet the Arvizo family?
Michael Davy: Fall of 2002.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And was that when Gavin and Star entered your school?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And Gavin and Star entered your school approximately November of 2002, right?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What grades were they in?
Michael Davy: Seventh.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. They both were in seventh?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Michael Davy: I think Gavin had lost a year. He's older, but he had lost a year from his health problems.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And had you known them before they entered your school in November of 2002?
Michael Davy: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you known anyone else in the family before they entered your school in 2002?
Michael Davy: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Gavin was consistently a disciplinary problem, correct?
Michael Davy: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: His behavior was disruptive and challenging, in your own words, correct?
Michael Davy: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Gavin would routinely act up in class, right?
Michael Davy: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: He would display poor cooperation with students and teachers, right?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: He would create situations in which he had an audience to view his poor behavior, right?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: His grades were low throughout his education, right?
Michael Davy: They were at John Burroughs.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Pardon me.
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: His grades at John Burroughs were consistently low, correct?
Michael Davy: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you felt he didn't apply himself in a constructive manner in school, right?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You had a number of parent meetings with Gavin, Janet and Jay in which Gavin's poor behavior was discussed at length, correct?
Michael Davy: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you felt that Gavin was the kind of young man who could handle himself with adults, right?
Michael Davy: He thought he was the kind of person.
Mr. Mesereau: You felt he could handle himself with adults also, didn't you?
Michael Davy: He was -- he was pretty glib, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You did actually write a report -- excuse me, not “write a report”. You gave an interview where you actually made that statement, did you not, about Gavin; that he can handle himself with adults?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You looked at his school records at one point, correct?
Michael Davy: You know, I don't recall that.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall concluding that Gavin's grades at your school were very similar to his grades at other schools he had attended?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. It calls for hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you yourself ever look at Gavin's grades from other schools and compare them to the grades he got at your school?
Michael Davy: You know, I don't recall that.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember being interviewed by a Sergeant Steve Robel of the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling Sheriff Robel that you saw a consistent pattern of poor grades from school to school with Gavin?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. It's hearsay. It calls for reliance on hearsay records.
The Court: Overruled.
Michael Davy: You know, I honestly don't recall it.
Mr. Mesereau: Might it refresh your recollection to look at a police report about your interview?
Michael Davy: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Davy, have you had a chance to look at that report? Does it refresh your recollection about what you told Sheriff Robel about that issue?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what did you tell him?
Michael Davy: That he had consistently underperformed in his academic pursuits.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall that you were asked if you had seen any change in Gavin's demeanor, attitude or academic performance from the period prior to February 2003 to the time Gavin returned to school on March 17th, 2003?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall your saying you had seen no definitive change in Gavin's demeanor, attitude or academic performance during that period?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, Gavin had a truancy counselor, correct?
Michael Davy: Well, are you talking about Mr. Coffman?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Michael Davy: Well, Mr. Coffman was an itinerant. He came to school two or three days a week and dealt with -- he would get computer readouts of people who had long-term absences.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Is the appropriate label for him truancy counselor?
Michael Davy: No, it's pupil service and attendance counselor.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you said he would come three days a week?
Michael Davy: Yeah. Oftentimes schools have to buy that time. So sometimes the school would buy two days and another school would buy three days, so he would split the assignment.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did you discuss issues involving Gavin with Mr. Coffman?
Michael Davy: I don't know about issues. I asked him to go to Gavin's house.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And the purpose was to talk to the family about why Gavin wasn't going to school?
Michael Davy: Right. At that point in time.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you indicated to the prosecutor that at some point someone named Vinnie Amen came to the school to check Gavin and Star out; is that correct?
Michael Davy: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And Mr. Amen provided the school with a copy of his identification, correct?
Michael Davy: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And he gave the school a copy of his New Jersey driver's license for the school files, right?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And to your knowledge, did he sign anything when he was checking these two students out; do you know?
Michael Davy: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: But your understanding was that Janet had given him permission to check out Gavin and Star, right?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Sneddon: I object, Your Honor. It calls for a conclusion.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: In your response to the prosecutor's questions, correct me if I'm wrong, did you say something to the effect that the school had permission from Janet to allow Mr. Amen to check out these two students?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. Calls for hearsay.
Mr. Mesereau: His state of mind, Your Honor. I believe he testified to it on direct.
The Court: The objection is sustained. I believe you objected to the same testimony.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: At some point, was it your understanding that Mr. Amen did, in fact, check out the two students?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And what would the normal procedure be for allowing someone not in the family to check out a student?
Michael Davy: A permission slip written by the parent.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did you follow the normal procedure when Mr. Amen was checking out Gavin and Star?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know how many meetings you had with Ms. Arvizo about Gavin's poor behavior?
Michael Davy: Not an exact number, no.
Mr. Mesereau: And when Gavin was checked out of the school, how long had he been attending that school, if you remember?
Michael Davy: Well, just months, since November. So November to late February.
Mr. Mesereau: And would it be accurate to say that even though he was only there a few months, it became readily apparent that he was a disciplinary problem, right?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: The disciplinary problems began -- excuse me. The disciplinary problems with Gavin began in November of 2002, right?
Michael Davy: I don't recollect the first time.
Mr. Mesereau: But certainly around that time, correct?
Michael Davy: Probably.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, what typically is the procedure you follow at this school if somebody has a disciplinary problem?
Mr. Sneddon: Object as immaterial, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall Gavin being late to class?
Michael Davy: Not specifically, but I'm guessing that he was.
Mr. Sneddon: Object. Move to strike. Speculation. That part beyond the --
The Court: It's stricken.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to look at some school records in that regard?
Michael Davy: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Davy, have you had a chance to look at those records?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do they refresh your recollection about disciplinary problems you had at your school with Gavin Arvizo?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Excuse me, Your Honor. I'm going to object to the question. That wasn't the question that he was refreshing. I won't talk any more, but I don't believe that's the question.
The Court: That's correct. It's not.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase my question, Your Honor. I'll withdraw that one.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Davy, does the document you just looked at refresh your recollection about Gavin being late to class?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And was that a problem with him while he attended your school?
Michael Davy: On occasion, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall a problem with Gavin banging on doors at your school?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall Gavin being consistently warned about his bad behavior?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall problems with Gavin arguing with teachers?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall problems with Gavin arguing with students?
Michael Davy: No, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection just to look at those records again?
Michael Davy: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that record?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, before counsel asks his next question, I want to interpose an objection to lack of foundation as to whether he's aware of those records. Has he ever seen them?
Mr. Mesereau: Just refreshing recollection, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. The objection as to lack of foundation is overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall, Mr. Davy, problems with Gavin arguing with another student?
Michael Davy: From those records, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall a problem with Gavin having a negative impact on his class?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall problems with him jumping around, quote, “like retarded people”?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall problems with Gavin mumbling in class?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall your having to detain Gavin for disciplinary problems?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what is the detention procedure that you would have used with him?
Michael Davy: Well, basically you have to stay after school for an hour.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And do you recall a problem with him that required lunch detention?
Michael Davy: Well, a number of people can assign detention, so I don't recall that. But I'm guessing that he served lunch detention.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you the records?
Michael Davy: If it's there, it happened.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: I think the problem that we have is that I overruled an objection by Mr. Sneddon about foundation, but the -- when counsel asks you if it refreshes your recollection, that doesn't mean that you then testify about what's in the record. It means do you independently -- now do you independently remember this? For example, “Do you know if he was late for school?” And you say, “I don't remember”. Then he says, “Well, will this refresh your recollection?” And you look at it. And that's asking you, “Do you” -- “Now do you remember seeing him be late for school”, not “What does the record say?”
Michael Davy: Okay, I misunderstood that.
The Court: Okay. So --
Michael Davy: The fact --
The Court: You don't need to come back to it. But the point we're at is, you want to ask him if he can refresh his recollection about -- what was it?
Mr. Mesereau: About Gavin having been detained at lunch.
The Court: Okay. Would looking at these records help you refresh your recollection about being detained at lunch?
Michael Davy: No, simply because oftentimes those are reflections of dean's entries or another counselor's entries.
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, could I -- Excuse me, Counsel.
The Court: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: I don't want to be burdensome, but I think that I would move to strike --
Bailiff Cortez: Microphone.
Mr. Sneddon: I don't want to be burdensome, but I move to strike all of the questions that he's used to refresh recollection until the proper foundation can be established that this witness actually remembered that, as opposed to some record.
Mr. Mesereau: I believe, Your Honor, the witness has said he remembers it and spoke to a sheriff in an interview and made those conclusions.
The Court: Well, the problem that's come up is whether or not he was refreshing his memory to things he actually can remember, or if he was just telling you what you showed him in the record. So what I'll do is go back and sustain the foundation objection that he made before you asked him these series of questions relating to Gavin's behavior and strike those answers. And then you can proceed again to see --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: -- what he remembers and what was just in the record.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Davy, I want to go back over some questions I asked you earlier. Now, you were interviewed by Sheriff Steve Robel of the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office approximately December 4th, 2003. Do you remember that?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was at your school in Hollywood, right?
Michael Davy: In Hancock Park, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And for the purpose of that interview, you obtained Gavin's cumulative school files and his disciplinary file, correct?
Michael Davy: I did. But one of the things that you need to understand is that there was another office that also handled discipline, other than the counseling office. And so some of the records that I think you're referring to came out of that office.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you did tell Sergeant Robel that you had obtained Gavin's cumulative school files and his discipline file from Bonnie Murrow, right?
Michael Davy: She took my place when I transferred, so she wasn't there at that time.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall telling Sergeant Robel that you had obtained Gavin's cumulative school files and his discipline file from Bonnie Murrow?
Michael Davy: I believe that was after I left the school.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you did obtain those files, correct?
Michael Davy: I went to obtain them. I think they were under subpoena.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall meeting with Sergeant Steve Robel in a principal's office to review and discuss the files' contents?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you did, in fact, discuss those contents with Sergeant Robel, right?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You gave Sergeant Robel a brief history of the schools Gavin had recently attended, true?
Michael Davy: True.
Mr. Mesereau: They were LeConte Middle School for sixth grade, right?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object as hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you counseled Gavin in your position at Burroughs?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what had you counseled Gavin about?
Michael Davy: Disruptive behavior in the classroom.
Mr. Mesereau: Why did you counsel Gavin about his disruptive behavior in the classroom?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, this has been asked and answered.
Mr. Mesereau: If it's in the record, Your Honor, I don't have a problem. But I wasn't sure if -- you'd asked me to go over this again.
Mr. Sneddon: Not this. Sorry, I apologize.
The Court: The objection is overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: Why did you counsel Gavin?
Michael Davy: I was receiving referrals from his classroom teachers.
Mr. Mesereau: Were they negative referrals?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Were they consistently negative referrals?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it normal procedure when you received consistently negative referrals about a student that you try to counsel that student?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have many counseling sessions with Gavin about his poor behavior?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know approximately how many you had?
Michael Davy: Probably a half a dozen.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you counsel him individually or with others present, if you know?
Michael Davy: Individually.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that the normal procedure for that type of counseling?
Michael Davy: Yes. Oftentimes with a parent, too, present.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you also counsel Gavin with any parent present?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what parent was typically present for those meetings?
Michael Davy: Miss Ventura. And sometimes Miss Ventura and Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you tell Ms. Ventura that Gavin's behavior was disruptive and challenging?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell Ms. Ventura that Gavin would routinely act up in class?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell Ms. Ventura that he displayed poor cooperation with students and teachers?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell Ms. Ventura that Gavin would create situations in which he had an audience to view his poor behavior?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you tell Ms. Ventura that his grades were consistently low throughout his schooling?
Michael Davy: I think she knew that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall meeting with Jay Jackson to talk about Gavin's poor behavior?
Michael Davy: With -- with Miss Ventura present.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. But you did meet with Miss Ventura and Jay Jackson to talk about Gavin's consistently disruptive behavior, right?
Michael Davy: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And Gavin was present at those meetings, correct?
Michael Davy: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told Ms. Ventura that you had seen no definitive change in Gavin's demeanor or attitude or academic performance from the period prior to February 2003 to the time following his return to school on March 17th, 2003, right?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you indicated that at some point, Mr. Coffman went to Gavin's home; is that correct?
Michael Davy: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know where that was?
Michael Davy: Not offhand. I mean, we use school records for that. I don't have access to that right now.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, did Mr. Coffman find anyone home?
Michael Davy: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you meet with Mr. Coffman to talk about that issue?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it Mr. Coffman's responsibility to try and locate Ms. Arvizo?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point, to your knowledge, he did locate her, correct?
Michael Davy: Well, what they typically do is talk to neighbors and leave business cards with people. And at some point she contacted me.
Mr. Mesereau: She contacted you and gave her permission to have Mr. Amen check out her sons, correct?
Michael Davy: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Object. Calls for a conclusion. It's the same question that was asked before.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall a problem with Gavin Arvizo singing in the classroom?
Michael Davy: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to look at these school records?
Michael Davy: Like I said, those records may have been written by someone else.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, the question would be if you remember.
Michael Davy: No, I do not.
Mr. Mesereau: Is it possible they would refresh your recollection about that, since you counseled him on those issues?
Michael Davy: I didn't -- I wasn't the only person that counseled him.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, let me ask you this: You don't remember an issue of him singing in class, right?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: If you look at some records, might they refresh your recollection about that problem?
Michael Davy: Well, it will refresh my memory that it happened, but that I may not have handled it. I don't know who wrote those records.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm only asking you about your memory about whether it happened, okay?
Michael Davy: I don't have a recollection.
Mr. Mesereau: Might it refresh your recollection to look at the records?
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object to the question. He says -- it's asked and answered.
The Court: All right. The witness is just trying to follow my instructions. Go ahead and show him the record.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that school record?
Michael Davy: I have.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about any problem in that regard?
Michael Davy: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall problems with Gavin disrupting test-taking?
Michael Davy: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that something you recall counseling him about?
Michael Davy: My general recollections of counseling him were disruptive behavior. Specifically whether it was testing or singing, whatever, it doesn't -- I can't speak to that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you talk to various teachers at the school about Gavin's consistently disruptive behavior?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How many teachers did you talk to about his disruptive behavior, if you remember?
Michael Davy: Well, I'm sure I spoke to the ones that were writing referrals.
Mr. Mesereau: Were a lot of his teachers writing referrals?
Michael Davy: The students at that grade level were in a group of teachers that had the same students all day. So generally if one teacher had a problem in that group, they all had a problem.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you questions about a teacher named Geraldt; is that correct?
Michael Davy: Geraldt.
Mr. Mesereau: And I believe you said words to the effect you thought he was somewhat -- acted in -- somewhat in a paramilitary kind of way?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you mean by that?
Michael Davy: Well, he had a kind of drill instructor demeanor, I mean, when he was dealing with students that were late to class or misbehaving.
Mr. Mesereau: But Gavin had many other teachers besides Mr. Geraldt complaining about him, didn't he?
Michael Davy: In fact, I don't think he had Mr. Geraldt as a classroom teacher. I think he probably had him for his ROTC, his extracurricular --
Mr. Mesereau: So the disruptive behavior that you've been talking about was disruptive behavior in the classroom, correct?
Michael Davy: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And those were classroom teachers that were referring these problems to you, right?
Michael Davy: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you said Mr. Geraldt taught a -- was it an after-school type of program?
Michael Davy: Well, he was an eighth grade science teacher, but he also had an ROTC class that sometimes met after school and on Saturdays. And he also ran the detention room after school.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you think he was too strict in the ROTC program?
Michael Davy: I don't know if he was too strict in his ROTC program.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you mentioned his paramilitary behavior. Was that in the ROTC program?
Michael Davy: No, that was in his dealing with students on the yard or in the morning when they were coming in late.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Do you recall him interacting with Gavin at all?
Michael Davy: I do not recall that.
Mr. Mesereau: If he had, would it be because Gavin was late?
Mr. Sneddon: Object; calls for speculation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Was one of Mr. Geraldt's functions to deal with late students?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And how would that work? I mean, if someone was late, how would they get to Mr. Geraldt?
Michael Davy: Well, he did not have a home room which met first thing in the morning, so Mr. Geraldt was assigned to process students at the front door that were late coming in.
Mr. Mesereau: So he would simply wait at the front door?
Michael Davy: Yeah. Everybody had to pass through the front door. People with passes or notes from home would proceed on. People that didn't would be processed by him.
Mr. Mesereau: And the procedure -- excuse me. The procedure he followed if he met someone at the front door who was late was what? What would he do?
Michael Davy: Well, he would write them a detention slip.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And would that detention slip be handed to the student?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And was there a procedure dictating what the student should do with that detention slip?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what were they supposed to do with the detention slip?
Michael Davy: One, they were supposed to get it signed by their parent and do their detention. It was an NCR paper, so we kept the copy.
Mr. Mesereau: Would the detention typically be done that day?
Michael Davy: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When would it typically be done?
Michael Davy: The next day after the parents were notified.
Mr. Mesereau: And was the proof that parents were notified their signature on the slip?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Would someone actually talk to the parent directly?
Michael Davy: Somebody from school?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Michael Davy: Not unless they didn't do the detention.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you do recall problems with Gavin being late, correct?
Michael Davy: My recollection is more clear on the discipline inside the classroom, the disruption in the classroom.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, when did you -- excuse me. Have you spoken to any prosecutor about your testimony today?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when was that?
Michael Davy: Last night.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Who did you speak to?
Michael Davy: Mr. Sneddon.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did he call you?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you spoke to him about what you were going to be asked today?
Michael Davy: We -- he just looked at my grand jury testimony and had questions about that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did he ask you questions about what you would be saying today?
Michael Davy: No, he was just clearing up what I had said, making him understand what I said during the grand jury testimony.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you reviewed your grand jury transcript?
Michael Davy: I have.
Mr. Mesereau: And how did you get it?
Michael Davy: I got it online.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And so you and Mr. Sneddon discussed what you said before the grand jury last night, right?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How long a discussion was that?
Michael Davy: Twenty minutes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you and Mr. Sneddon discuss Gavin's poor record for discipline in that call?
Michael Davy: Briefly.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me?
Michael Davy: Briefly.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you and Mr. Sneddon discuss your interview with Sheriff Robel?
Michael Davy: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You did discuss Mr. Geraldt, correct?
Michael Davy: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. Sneddon bring up the name “Geraldt” in that conversation?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he tell you he would ask you questions about Mr. Geraldt today?
Michael Davy: I don't think so. He just wanted me to tell him about it.
Mr. Mesereau: In that conversation, did you inform Mr. Sneddon that Mr. Geraldt had not actually been a classroom teacher for Gavin?
Michael Davy: I don't think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you talk about Mr. Geraldt's responsibilities at the door of the school?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you talk about his responsibilities in the ROTC program?
Michael Davy: Briefly.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: Counsel?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, Your Honor.
The Court: We'll take our break.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Davy, you met the gentleman who identified himself as Vinnie Amen, didn't you?
Michael Davy: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you expressed surprise at how young he seemed to be, right?
Michael Davy: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And you described him as business-like, real cooperative and wearing dressy casual clothes, right?
Michael Davy: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: I have no further questions, Your Honor.
The Court: Counsel?
Mr. Sneddon: No questions.
The Court: All right. Thank you. You may step down. Call your next witness.
Mr. Sneddon: Janet Williams.

Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. SNEDDON:
Mr. Sneddon: Ms. Williams, you're now retired; is that correct?
Janet Williams: I am.
Mr. Sneddon: And before your retirement where did you work?
Janet Williams: I worked for Santa Barbara County Sheriff.
Mr. Sneddon: And how long had you worked for them?
Janet Williams: A little over 29 years.
Mr. Sneddon: I think the bailiff's about to tell you to scoot into that microphone. In case we missed it, how many years?
Janet Williams: 29 years.
Mr. Sneddon: And at the time of your retirement, what was your assignment?
Janet Williams: I was working investigations at Coastal Station, which is located in Carpinteria.
Mr. Sneddon: And how long had you been at that particular assignment?
Janet Williams: Ten years.
Mr. Sneddon: And prior to that, where were you assigned?
Janet Williams: I was assigned to the main station in Goleta.
Mr. Sneddon: In what capacity was that?
Janet Williams: Jail, patrol, investigations, variety of assignments.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, prior to the time that you retired in November, the 18th of 2003, were you assigned to participate in the execution of a search warrant at Neverland Valley Ranch?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And during the course of your responsibilities on that particular day, did you -- were you responsible for seizing certain items of evidence?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And in particular, were you at one point in time assigned to search the downstairs area of Mr. Jackson's bedroom suite?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And in that area, did you find some items that you seized?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And could you just generally describe the area that you took these items from?
Janet Williams: The area appeared to be similar to a sitting room. It had a piano, large screen televisions and chairs, and some books. Fireplace. That kind of area.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I'm going to show you a photograph. Counsel, it's 90 and it's in evidence.
Mr. Sanger: What number?
Mr. Sneddon: Nine -- 9-0.
Mr. Sanger: That's fine. Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to the exhibit that I placed in front of you, which is a photograph, which is People's 90 which is in evidence, do you recognize the area that's depicted in that photograph?
Janet Williams: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: When and where was the first time that you saw -- or were in that particular location?
Janet Williams: It would have been the day of the search.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you see depicted in the photograph, People's 90, the area from which you obtained some items that you seized and then had booked into evidence?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And I gave you a red pen. Would you put an arrow to the area where you obtained the items from?
Janet Williams: An arrow on the photograph?
Mr. Sneddon: Yes. Yes, mark on the photograph. Now, in that photograph -- let me get the photograph for just a second. I was looking for the laser.
Mr. Zonen: Oh, here's the laser. Gordon? Your Honor, could we have the input, I think four?
Mr. Auchincloss: “Input 4”.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Ms. Williams, with regard to the photograph that we have on the board, which is People's 90 in evidence, can you point out to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury the arrow that you placed on that exhibit. Use the laser, if you would. I think you might be pointing it the wrong way.
Janet Williams: Could be. Oh. Found the right button, sorry.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. So it's the one that comes down on the right-hand side of the photograph. And below that, directly below that are a number of boxes and books; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that the area from which you seized certain items?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. In this particular room -- well, that's okay. I'll do it another way. I think we can have the lights for right now, Your Honor. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sanger: All right. Go ahead.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I'm handing you a bag, a plastic bag that has the number “590” on it, 590 marked for identification purposes. And inside the bag are four books that have been marked 59-A (sic), B, C and D. So I'm going to ask you some questions about these, okay?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to 590-A, do you recognize that book?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was the book the first time that you saw it?
Janet Williams: The book was inside one of the boxes that was -- that I depicted by the arrow.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, there are a number of boxes there. Do you recall which one of the boxes that 59-A (sic) came out of?
Janet Williams: I do not.
Mr. Sneddon: But it was from one of those boxes?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, is that book in the same condition as when you seized it on that particular day?
Janet Williams: It appears to be.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, let's go to 59-B -- 590-B. Okay. Do you recognize that exhibit?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when and where was that the first time you saw it?
Janet Williams: Inside one of the boxes from the same area.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember what specific box it was in?
Janet Williams: I do not.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall whether it was with the Exhibit 59 -- 590-A?
Janet Williams: I do not.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's go to the next one then, 590-C. Do you recognize that?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was that book the first time you saw it?
Janet Williams: In one of the boxes from the same area.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that the same condition as when you first saw it?
Janet Williams: It appears to be.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And then let's go to 590-D, like in “David”. All right. Do you recognize that book?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that one of the books you seized?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: From the same area?
Janet Williams: Same area, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recall whether it was with the other -- any of the other books, A, B or C?
Janet Williams: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to that book, does it appear to be in the same condition as when you first saw it?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Your Honor, I move that 590-A through D be admitted into evidence.
Mr. Sanger: Submit it.
The Court: They're admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to display these, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: 590-A, now, this particular book is titled, “Bob and Rob”. After you took it out of one of those boxes that are depicted in the photograph, People's 90, what did you do with this particular book?
Janet Williams: I took it to the area where Detective Padilla was preparing the documents showing the items that were being seized.
Mr. Sneddon: He was designated as what we call “the scribe”?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What you call “the scribe”?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. All right. Let's put up 590-B. With regard to this particular exhibit, “Before the Hand of Man”, what did you do with that after you seized it?
Janet Williams: The same procedure, I took it over to Detective Padilla for scribing in.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. 590-C. This is a book called “Room to Play”. And you obtained that from the same areas, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what did you do with it after you obtained it?
Janet Williams: I took it to Detective Padilla.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And lastly, 590-D. That was also found in those boxes?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you also took that to the detective?
Janet Williams: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Thank you. Lights are fine. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I've handed counsel for his examination a clear plastic bag which has inside of it a white binder. This exhibit has been marked as 591 for identification purposes.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to ask you to look at 591. Now, yesterday, I asked you to take a look at that exhibit, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you did take a look at that exhibit, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And inside of the Exhibit 591, which has the white binder, there are two items, two magazines, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Are those magazines that you seized on November 18th?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: From where?
Janet Williams: From the same area as the books that we've previously discussed.
Mr. Sneddon: The books in 590?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to the two exhibits that -- the two magazines that are inside the Exhibit 591, are they in the same condition now as when you first viewed them?
Janet Williams: No.
Mr. Sneddon: In what respect are they different?
Janet Williams: They've been disassembled. They were intact at the time that I seized them.
Mr. Sneddon: But they are the same two magazines that you took?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Move that 591 be admitted into evidence, Your Honor.
Mr. Sanger: I will submit it, Your Honor.
The Court: It's admitted. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I have a clear plastic bag which has on the outside of it “Exhibit No. 834”. That's on the outside of the bag. And from inside the bag there are four magazines that have been marked consecutively as 592, 593, 594 and 595. And I've shown them to counsel for his examination. And I'm going to approach the witness.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: First of all, there's the bag that's marked as 834, and the four magazines, 592 through 595. Do you recognize those?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And those were also exhibits that I had you look at yesterday; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you've had a chance to go through them; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard -- let's take them one at a time. 592, where was it the first time that you saw it?
Janet Williams: It was inside one of the boxes that I labeled on the photograph.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, the title of these magazines -- or this magazine is?
Janet Williams: This is “The Nudist”.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And they must be from a long time ago because they're 15 cents.
Janet Williams: It says “March 1935”.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, do you remember where in those boxes that you found the Exhibit 592?
Janet Williams: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Which one of the boxes?
Janet Williams: No, I do not.
Mr. Sneddon: Let's go to 593. Do you recognize that?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that another one of the magazines that you took out of those boxes?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And are 592 and 593 in the same condition as when you first saw them?
Janet Williams: Seems to be, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And this one's called “Sunbather”; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Let's go to 594. That's also a nudist -- the title is “The Nudist”, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did you find that particular item?
Janet Williams: In one of the boxes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And then let's -- I mean, is it in the same condition as when you found it?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And 595? It's another of “The Nudist”, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that in the same condition as when you saw it?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And where did you see it first?
Janet Williams: One of the boxes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regards to the Exhibit 592, 593, 594 and 595 - okay? - can you tell us whether those exhibits were all together in the same box or in different boxes? Do you have a recollection about that?
Janet Williams: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to those exhibits, 592, 3, 4 and 5, what did you do with them after you seized them from the box or boxes that you found them?
Janet Williams: I took them to Detective Padilla for scribing and booking.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'd move that 592 through 595 be admitted into evidence, as well as the bag that contains it, which is 834.
Mr. Sanger: I'll submit it.
The Court: They're admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: Miss Williams, I'm now asking you to look at three books, and the first one is numbered 596, 597, and I believe 599. Would you take a look at those for me, if you would. Do you recognize those exhibits?
Janet Williams: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sanger: Counsel, you didn't show me those, I don't think.
Mr. Sneddon: I apologize. I was trying to be too efficient.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's start with 596, “Man, A Sexual Study of Man”. Where was that the first time you saw it?
Janet Williams: This was inside one of the boxes.
Mr. Sneddon: And the same location as the other item?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And is it in the same condition as when you first saw it?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And the next one, 597, “The Golden Age of Neglect”. Do you recognize that?
Janet Williams: I do.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that one of the items that you seized?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where was it when you saw it the first time?
Janet Williams: This was also inside one of the boxes.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recall whether it was in the same box as any of the other items that you previously identified?
Janet Williams: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And with regard to 599, do you recognize that?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was that the first time you saw it?
Janet Williams: Inside one of the boxes.
Mr. Sneddon: And the same area?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: The boxes that you've previously talked about?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that in the same condition as when you first saw it?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Your Honor, I move that 596, 97 and 99 be admitted into evidence.
Mr. Sanger: Submit it, Your Honor.
The Court: They're admitted. All three.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. We need the lights out again and “Input 4” again.
Mr. Sneddon: 596 is the book, “Man, A Sexual Study of Man”. Now, with regard to that particular book, after you seized it, what did you do with it?
Janet Williams: I took it over to Detective Padilla to have it scribed and booked into evidence.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And 597, do you recognize that?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And with regard to that particular item, what did you do with it after you seized it?
Janet Williams: I took it to Detective Padilla for scribing and booking into evidence.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And the last item, which is 599, did you follow the same procedure with regard to that particular book?
Janet Williams: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Thank you. You can turn the lights on. Thank you. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I have a bag that's been marked as People's 835 for identification purposes. And inside of the bag are Exhibits 598 and then Exhibit 600 consecutively through 613. So it's 598 and then 600 through 613. And I've shown them to counsel. And may I approach the witness, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Ms. Williams, I'm showing you the exhibit that's been marked. It's a plastic bag, 835. You see that?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And then I took out -- from 835, I took 598 and then 600 through 613. Now, did I ask you yesterday to look at all of those magazines contained in there?
Janet Williams: Yes, you did.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recognize those magazines? Let's just do 598 first. Do you recognize 598?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where was 598 the first time that you saw it?
Janet Williams: It was in one of the boxes that I mentioned earlier.
Mr. Sneddon: And the title of the magazine?
Janet Williams: “The Nudist”.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. So why don't we take 5 -- is it in the same condition as when you first saw it?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Let's put that one aside. Now, with regard to 600 through 613, were you asked to look through those magazines?
Janet Williams: Yes, I was.
Mr. Sneddon: And those magazines are basically the same magazines, “The Nudist”, and then there's a few other different ones in there?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And were those all magazines that you found in the downstairs area of Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And where in that area?
Janet Williams: Within the boxes earlier mentioned.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And were those also items that you gave to Detective Padilla to be scribed and booked into evidence?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And are the ones that you looked at and the ones I'm talking about now, 600 through 613, are they in the same condition as when you first saw them on the 18th of November, 2003?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's put those back in here. And I move that 598 and 600 through 613 be admitted into evidence, Your Honor.
Mr. Sanger: I will submit it.
The Court: They're admitted. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I have a brown paper bag with a sheriff's evidence booking tag on the front of it, and I've had affixed to it the Exhibit No. 836 to the brown bag. And contained inside of the brown bag are Exhibits 614, 615, 616, 617, 618 and 619 for identification purposes. And I've shown them to counsel and he's examined them, Your Honor. And I'd like to approach again.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: These exhibits I've handed you came from the bag marked Exhibit 836, okay? And again, yesterday, I had you examine the items that came out of that bag, Item 836, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And those bags -- actually, those items have been chemically treated, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the first exhibit, 614, it's a binder. And did you have an opportunity to examine that item yesterday?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And inside of that binder, 614, did you recognize the item inside?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what was that?
Janet Williams: It was a magazine.
Mr. Sneddon: And was it the same type of variety of the others that you've identified?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: At the time that you saw it yesterday, was it in a different format as when you first saw it?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: How is it different now than when you first saw it?
Janet Williams: It is -- has now been disassembled and chemically treated.
Mr. Sneddon: Other than that, are the contents of the binder, the white binder that's been marked as 614, the same as the magazine that you picked up on November 18?
Janet Williams: It appears to be, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Put that aside, and let's just go to 615, if we could. And 615, inside the plastic bag, do you -- I had you examine that item yesterday, too, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And what is the title of that document? Here, let me. I got my hands dirty. I'll do it.
Janet Williams: It is “The Nudist”.
Mr. Sneddon: So these are the like kind of magazine that we've previously -- you've previously identified?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And other than having been chemically treated and disassembled, is the Exhibit 615 the same exhibit that you seized from Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's go to 616. Do you recognize that? You were asked to look at it yesterday, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And it's the same type of magazine, “Sunshine and Health, The Nudist”, as 615 is, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sneddon: Other than being chemically treated and disassembled, is it in the same condition as when you first saw it in Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, these items, 614, 615 and 616, where were they found?
Janet Williams: They were found in the boxes that I've mentioned earlier.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Do you remember whether they were found in the same boxes with the other items or in different boxes?
Janet Williams: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Go ahead and put that up there. And let's go to 617. Do you recognize that?
Janet Williams: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: And that's another magazine of the same brand, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sneddon: Same title?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And it has also been chemically treated, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And disassembled?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Have you had the opportunity to examine the contents of that yesterday?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that also a magazine that you obtained from Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And from the same area that you previously told the jury?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Put that up there. Is it in the same condition, other than the chemical treatment and it's disassembled, as when you first saw it?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. The next item is 618. Do you recognize that?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was that the first time you saw it?
Janet Williams: Within one of the boxes from the same area.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to that exhibit, what's different about it now than when you first saw it? And by “that exhibit”, I mean 618.
Janet Williams: This one has also been chemically treated and disassembled.
Mr. Sneddon: Other than that, it's the same?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Would you put that up on top. And let's go to 619. Do you recognize 619 for identification purposes?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was that the first time that you saw it?
Janet Williams: From within one of those boxes.
Mr. Sneddon: And that one has also been chemically treated and disassembled, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes, it has.
Mr. Sneddon: Other than that, is it in the same condition as when you first saw it?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And with regard to these items that we've had marked for identification purposes 614 through 619, were these also given to Detective Padilla, the scribe?
Janet Williams: Yes, they were.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I move that 614 through 619 be admitted into evidence, as well as the bag which contains these exhibits, which is 836.
Mr. Sanger: Submitted.
The Court: They're admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: We're almost there. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: All right, Your Honor. At this time I've had marked for identification purposes a bag, a brown bag, with, again, a sheriff's evidence tag with the number “#366” at the top. And the number here is 837. And from inside of that bag I've withdrawn two exhibits. One is a magazine. And its identification is 620 for identification. The title is “Eden”, E-d-e-n, and the exhibit number 621 is “The Nudist” I've had marked for identification purposes. And then lastly -- and I've shown those to counsel for his examination. And lastly, I have a brown bag, again with a sheriff's evidence tag on it, with the number “359” in black in the upper right-hand corner. Inside the bag I've withdrawn the contents and shown to counsel a book called “Poo-Chi”, P-o-o-C-h-i. I'm sure I'm not pronouncing it correctly. But that's as good as it gets. And may I approach again, with your permission?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, with regard to the Exhibit 837, that's the brown bag, okay? We have 620 and 621. So let me ask you the questions. 620, where did you find it?
Janet Williams: I found this within one of the boxes.
Mr. Sneddon: And is it in the same condition today as when you first found it?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: This one hasn't been treated or disassembled, correct?
Janet Williams: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And then 621, where did you find that?
Janet Williams: Within one of the boxes.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to 621, is it in the same condition as when you first saw it?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to 620 and 621, did you give those also to Detective Padilla?
Janet Williams: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. If I can have those back. And these are in the same condition as when you first seized them?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: If I didn't ask you, where did you seize these two items, 620 and 621, from?
Janet Williams: They were from within one of the boxes.
Mr. Sneddon: And lastly, 538 (sic). I'm taking out of the bag a book and handing it to you, the contents of 538 (sic). Do you recognize that book?
Janet Williams: May I look at that?
Mr. Sneddon: Absolutely.
Janet Williams: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall where that item was the first time you saw it?
Janet Williams: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: Where?
Janet Williams: This was located in a bookcase that is on the far wall of the den area.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. I'm going to come back up and show you Exhibit 90. Do you recognize the area where you found Exhibit 838?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Would you put an arrow to it? And would you just write “838” up there?
The Court: I think you'd earlier called that 538. Am I correct?
Mr. Sneddon: The book, Your Honor? It's 838.
The Clerk: He misspoke.
Mr. Sneddon: I misspoke?
The Court: I'm sorry, I just want the record to reflect that when you said 538, you meant 838.
Mr. Sneddon: I did, Your Honor. Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. For the record, on Exhibit 90 you put a red arrow and an “838” to the right of the red arrow; is that correct?
Janet Williams: I did.
Mr. Sneddon: And that is the location where you found Exhibit 838?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that exhibit in the same condition as to when you found it --
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- on November 18th?
Janet Williams: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you also give that to Detective Padilla?
Janet Williams: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Thank you. Move that Item 837 and the contents, which are 620 and 621, and 838 and the contents, be admitted into evidence, Your Honor.
Mr. Sanger: Submitted, Your Honor.
The Court: They're admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: I believe that's it. No further questions.
The Court: Mr. Sanger?
Mr. Sanger: Thank you, Your Honor.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: Detective Williams, how are you?
Janet Williams: Fine, thank you.
Mr. Sanger: You -- and you're retired, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: May I still call you “detective”? Is that okay?
Janet Williams: I'm happy with it.
Mr. Sanger: When did you retire exactly? You said that, and I missed it.
Janet Williams: February of last year.
Mr. Sanger: February of --
Janet Williams: 2004.
Mr. Sanger: 2004, okay. You were active duty and still working actively for the sheriff's department in November of 2003; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, Detective Williams, I think you said you've been a sheriff's officer for 29 years; is that right?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And in fact, if I'm not mistaken, you were one of the first two female officers in the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department; is that correct?
Janet Williams: No.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Close to it, in any event?
Janet Williams: Close.
Mr. Sanger: There's a story behind there that I haven't got quite right. But in any event, you have a long career with the sheriff's department; is that right?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you have been a detective for how long?
Janet Williams: I was a detective two different periods. The last time in Coastal Station, which was ten years. And then prior to that, it was at the main station, which was for nine years.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And part of what you did as a detective was specialize in sex crimes; is that right?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So you have a great deal of experience being the lead detective in sex offenses; is that right?
Janet Williams: I have some experience, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Well, when you say “some”, are you being modest? You've had quite a number of cases where you've been the lead officer --
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- in sex cases, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And in this particular case, your assignment was to assist on one of the searches that was occurring on November 18th, 2003; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you were then -- you were then not asked to do anything else. You were given no other assignments in this case; is that correct?
Janet Williams: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Now, if I understand what you did, you focused your attention on that first floor. And could I have the exhibits? I'd like 590, if you have it there.
Mr. Sneddon: It's up there.
Mr. Sanger: Oh, it's up there? May I approach to retrieve it?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: May I put this back up on the screen, Your Honor?
Mr. Sanger: Now, you've already told us that this is the first floor. But just so we're oriented, for people who are not oriented already, the boxes of books that you referred to under the arrow are to the right of a television, large screen T.V. console; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And there's additional -- an additional part of the room to the left on this picture that you can't see in the picture; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And did you search that entire area?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Behind the piano -- in fact, do you have the pointer there still? Okay. Would you be kind enough to point to the piano? Okay. By the way, on the piano, was there a letter from Steven Spielberg sitting there?
Mr. Sneddon: Object as immaterial, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Janet Williams: I don't remember.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Behind the piano that you just pointed to is an alcove area; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Can you point to that? And there are quite a number of books in that area as well, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And that's where you found 838; is that right?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Most of the books in that area are art books; is that correct? Or art and entertainment kind of books?
Janet Williams: I believe so. I don't remember exactly, but I believe there were quite a number of those.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And then on the -- where you've drawn the other arrow to the boxes, and you indicated you found the other exhibits that you've talked about today, there are -- there were a number of boxes there; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: You don't know whether those boxes were coming or going or had been sitting there, do you?
Janet Williams: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: You don't know whether or not Mr. Jackson had even looked inside those boxes, do you?
Janet Williams: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, Mr. Jackson is an artist; is that correct? A performer?
Janet Williams: He's a performer, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And he's an artist. He writes and composes music and choreographs dance, that sort of thing; is that correct?
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object as immaterial; lack of foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Sanger: Is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you saw a tremendous number of books that pertained to that sort of thing, art and dance and entertainment, music, correct?
Janet Williams: I remember seeing books of that nature, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Do you know if people send books to Mr. Jackson?
Mr. Sneddon: Object; calls for speculation.
Mr. Sanger: It's a “yes” or “no”, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes, you may answer “yes” or “no”.
Janet Williams: I don't know if people send him books.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, of all of the books that you have identified -- and I'm not going to go through by number here. But out of all of the books that you've identified, there are no books in that group that are unlawful for an adult to purchase; is that correct?
Janet Williams: I don't think there are.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And none of those books are unlawful for an adult to possess in his home; is that correct?
Janet Williams: I believe you're correct.
Mr. Sanger: You mentioned that -- let's put it this way: You saw a number of these books. Let me see if I can take them out, here.
The Court: Are you through with the picture up there?
Mr. Sanger: Yes, Your Honor. And then I'll -- thank you.
Mr. Sanger: I'll just refer you for the moment to Exhibit -- the bag is 835 and the contents are 598 and following. Do you remember those magazines? Would you like me to bring them to you?
Janet Williams: I remember them basically, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. These magazines are, I think you said, from 1931; is that correct?
Janet Williams: They're from different years; 1935, '37, that era.
Mr. Sanger: That's true, actually. These are from 1935. And the title of the publication is “The Nudist”; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: These appear to be collector's items, do they not?
Janet Williams: They could be.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And you have no information as to whether or not Mr. Jackson even knew that they were in the box; is that correct?
Mr. Sneddon: Object. It calls for speculation.
The Court: I was going to say she could answer “yes” or “no”, but anybody I've ever said that to has never answered “yes” or “no”. (To the witness) Don't answer that “yes” or “no”. (Laughter.)
Janet Williams: But I should answer?
The Court: Yes.
Janet Williams: So, may I ask what the question was again, please?
Mr. Sanger: I think His Honor is kidding with you. You can answer “yes” or “no”. Do you have any information as to whether or not Mr. Jackson ever saw these nudist magazines?
Janet Williams: I don't have any information that he did or did not see them. (Laughter.)
Mr. Sanger: There you go.
The Court: Someone following my instructions.
Mr. Sanger: Now, in the part of Mr. Jackson's house that you searched, do you know how many books were there total?
Janet Williams: No, I do not.
Mr. Sanger: Were there thousands?
Janet Williams: There were many books.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. At least hundreds?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And you went to some other places in the residence other than that particular room, did you not?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: What other places did you go to?
Janet Williams: The second story, a pantry-like room, a large room with multiple games and toys, and two bedrooms.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And you saw books elsewhere in the house besides where you were searching here in this room; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Some books.
Mr. Sanger: Did you -- in order get to that room, you had to walk down a hallway, right?
Janet Williams: To the den area. Is that what you're talking about?
Mr. Sanger: Yes.
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And that hallway was lined, floor to ceiling, with bookshelves filled with books; is that correct?
Janet Williams: I don't remember.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. That's fair enough. And there was a library just off of that hallway as well. Did you take a look in that library?
Janet Williams: No.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, you said you did go upstairs, because you went into Mr. Jackson's son's room; is that right?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And right up there by his son's room is an alcove that is filled with children's books; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And again, there are hundreds of books up there; is that right?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Did you have occasion to go to the arcade where there is a room that is basically filled with books?
Janet Williams: Are you talking the same room that's the second story of the main residence?
Mr. Sanger: No, it's a different building. The arcade building.
Janet Williams: I did not go there.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Of all the books that you saw, you seized the ones that you felt might be of some evidentiary value based on what you understood this case to be about; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. I'm going to ask you to take a look at 599, and see if we can.... May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: I'm going to show you 599. That appears to be a book of photographs that were taken some time ago; is that correct?
Janet Williams: May I look through it?
Mr. Sanger: Yes, please. They appear to be old photographs?
Janet Williams: They look like they could be old photographs. They have the sepia tone into them.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And you said that as far as you know, there's nothing illegal about an adult possessing that book in the United States, or in California, let's say?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: The United States in general, okay. Were you aware that that particular author, that photographer, was prosecuted and acquitted during the Nazi regime prior to World War II for those very photographs?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object as immaterial.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sanger: Let's put it this way: As you look at that, that appears to be a historic book, a book of recording historic photographs; is that correct?
Janet Williams: I don't know what you mean by that.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Did you do any research as to any of the authors of any of these books?
Janet Williams: No.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So in other words, that day you were there, your job was to look at things and see if they appeared to be within the search warrant and you seized them?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. All right. Let me show you -- let me ask you, before I show you something else, you seized some other things that have not been introduced into evidence here; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. You seized some paperwork from Mr. Jackson's son's room; is that right?
Janet Williams: I believe so.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And you seized some other things. You seized a Christmas invitation from Liza Minnelli; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, I'm also going to show you Exhibit 838. May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And I'll take this back, if I may.
Mr. Sanger: That's 838. Before I ask you about it, your procedure in searching through all these books and boxes and things was to -- was to find books that, by their cover, looked like they would warrant some further interest on your part, right?
Janet Williams: Usually I would open up the books to try to see what was inside also.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. But you didn't flip through every single book in that room?
Janet Williams: No.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So first of all, you'd look at something that looked like it might be a book that had something to do with sex. Is that pretty much what you were looking for?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And then once you found that book, you would look through it and see if you felt that it was the type of book that you thought should be seized in this case, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And you've indicated you seized some other items besides that, but when it came to these books that related to some sexual topic, you would actually look in them and make a determination that you should take it, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, on No. 837 -- I'm sorry, what is that? 838, the bag 838, and inside the bag is the book, right?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you seized -- have you looked inside the book?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, again, you're an experienced sex crimes detective, correct?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: So you're not shocked by seeing pictures of the human body; is that right?
Janet Williams: I can still be shocked.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Were you shocked by that book that's called Poo-Chi, P-o-o-C-h-i?
Janet Williams: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you described it as -- if I get your exact -- do you recall how you described it?
Janet Williams: How I described it?
Mr. Sanger: Yes. Did you describe it as a book containing photographs of the female groin area?
Janet Williams: I may have. I'm not sure if I did or if that's the way Detective Padilla understood what I said.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Well, did you say something like that to him?
Janet Williams: Probably.
Mr. Sanger: And does that appear to be what you described to him?
Janet Williams: Well, some of it looks like it, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So the question is, is that pretty much what you told Detective Padilla, that you have a book that appears to be photographs of the female groin area?
Janet Williams: Probably.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And, Detective, as you look at that a little more carefully, those are pictures of armpits and other bodily folds, that are not from genital areas, that are made to look like that as a spoof of some sort; is that correct?
Janet Williams: Some of them could be. And some of them I don't know.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And once again, there's nothing illegal about owning that book, is there?
Janet Williams: Not that I'm aware.
Mr. Sanger: And you don't know if Mr. Jackson even ever saw that before, do you?
Janet Williams: I do not know.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Thank you. I have no further questions.
Mr. Sneddon: No questions.
The Court: All right. Thank you. You're excused.
Janet Williams: Thank you.
The Court: We'll take our recess. Remember, tomorrow's a half day. See you tomorrow at 8:30.
Adjourn Message: The proceedings adjourned at 2:30 p.m.
