Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Good morning, Miss Robson.
Joy Robson: Good morning.
Mr. Mesereau: Miss Robson, where is your home?
Joy Robson: In Sherman Oaks, California.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know the fellow seated at counsel table to my right?
Joy Robson: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Who is he?
Joy Robson: That's Michael Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: How long have you known him?
Joy Robson: 18 years.
Mr. Mesereau: And how did you meet Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: Originally, in Australia in --
Mr. Mesereau: I think you need to speak up a little bit.
Joy Robson: Sorry. In Australia. He was touring on the “Bad” tour, and my son Wade was five years old and won a Michael Jackson look-alike/dance-alike competition.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you develop a friendship with Michael Jackson?
Joy Robson: Not immediately. Two years later, we returned to the United States for -- Wade was dancing here, and we reassociated with him at that point, and became friends from there, from 1989.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you still Michael Jackson's friend?
Joy Robson: Absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you been to Neverland?
Joy Robson: Many times.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think you visited Neverland?
Joy Robson: I have no idea. We average about four times a year since we've lived in the United States, which is 14 years now, and quite a few times before that.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember the first time you visited Neverland?
Joy Robson: Yes. It was in January of 1990.
Mr. Mesereau: And how did you end up visiting Neverland?
Joy Robson: When we were here, we called around, trying to find Michael again. He had told us if we returned to the United States to contact him. So we called around, and we eventually were put onto his personal assistant, which at that time was Norma Stakos, and they called Michael. He remembered us, and said he would like to see us again. So we met him at a recording studio where he was working at the time.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you stay at Neverland on that first visit?
Joy Robson: Yes, he invited us to stay that weekend, so we did. We went -- we were touring the United States, we were here on vacation as well. We went away for the week, and came back for the second weekend.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you seen Michael Jackson's bedroom at Neverland?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you first see Michael Jackson's bedroom at Neverland?
Joy Robson: That first weekend when we stayed with him.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever stayed in that room yourself?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall your son staying in Michael Jackson's room at Neverland?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And explain that, if you would.
Joy Robson: Well, the first -- the first night they had been out doing the usual thing at Neverland, playing. And later that night, they all came back to the suite where my husband and I were staying, and my parents were with us, as well. We were all talking in the suite. And Wade had been impersonating Michael for some time and had lots of costumes of Michael's that we had made. And Michael was looking at them, and we were just all discussing those. And then it was getting late, and my children said to me, both Chantel and Wade, my daughter, said, “Can we stay with Michael”. And my husband and I sort of looked at Michael, and said, “Well, if that's okay with you”. And he said, “Oh, absolutely. If they'd like to stay, that's fine”.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you allow your son and daughter to stay in his room?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think your son and daughter stayed in his room?
Joy Robson: Many times. I have no idea.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever have a problem with them doing that?
Joy Robson: Not at all.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever traveled with Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: Only once. We went to Las Vegas with him.
Mr. Mesereau: What was the purpose of that trip?
Joy Robson: We went to see Siegfried & Roy.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you get to Las Vegas for that trip?
Joy Robson: We went on a private jet. I think it belonged to Steve Wynn. We were staying at The Mirage.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you stay at The Mirage Hotel?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And where did you stay?
Joy Robson: We had a penthouse suite. There were two bedrooms, and I stayed in one of them.
Mr. Mesereau: And who stayed in the other room?
Joy Robson: Michael and Wade sort of went between both rooms. He did stay in Michael's room most of the time.
Mr. Mesereau: And were you ever in Michael's room on that trip?
Joy Robson: Yes. As a matter of fact, we spent a whole day sitting in bed, the three of us, eating popcorn, watching cartoons.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever see anything inappropriate happen on that trip?
Joy Robson: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever see anything inappropriate happen at Neverland?
Joy Robson: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When's the last time you spoke to Michael Jackson?
Joy Robson: Two weeks ago. We visited his children at Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And do you consider yourselves friends of the family of Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: We consider us very good friends, if not family.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did Mr. Jackson ever use the word “family” to describe you and your children?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever have any problem with that?
Joy Robson: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever seen Mr. Jackson hug your children?
Joy Robson: Mr. Jackson hugs everyone.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever seen Mr. Jackson kiss your children on the cheek?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever have a problem with that?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever see Mr. Jackson hold any of your children by the hand?
Joy Robson: I think so, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever have a problem with that?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever seen Mr. Jackson playing with your children?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what did you see him do?
Joy Robson: He'd play -- I've seen him play games, hide-and-seek. I've seen them climb trees. I've seen them play in the water fort at the ranch. They play constantly.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever have any problem with any of that?
Joy Robson: No. We all did it together often. We were -- all played together.
Mr. Mesereau: How would you describe Neverland?
Joy Robson: I would have once said the happiest place on earth. I -- I always felt that when we arrived at Neverland, you forgot all your problems, you forgot everything. It seemed like a world on its own. You would drive in there, and it was very serene, very peaceful, very beautiful. Inspirational. And everything was perfect when you drive out and reality would hit again.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you like to do there?
Mr. Sneddon: Object as immaterial, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you do at Neverland?
Mr. Sneddon: Object as immaterial.
Mr. Mesereau: They put an issue what Neverland's all about, Your Honor.
The Court: The objection is overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you do at Neverland?
Joy Robson: We watched movies. I particularly liked the chimpanzees. I spent a lot of time playing with the chimps. All the animals, I enjoyed. We would play on the water fort. We'd drive the quads around the hills. Just a fun time always.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you ever meet someone named Blanca Francia?
Joy Robson: When you say “meet” her, I mean, I knew she was working there, and I basically would say “Good morning” to her if I saw her, but that would be the extent of it.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever see your son in a shower with Michael Jackson?
Joy Robson: No. Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever seen the Jacuzzi at Neverland?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever been in it yourself?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times, do you think?
Joy Robson: Oh. Maybe six or eight times.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, to your knowledge, has your daughter ever been in Michael Jackson's room at Neverland?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did she ever stay over there, to your knowledge?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have any problem with that?
Joy Robson: Not at all.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions.
The Court: Cross-examine?
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SNEDDON:
Mr. Sneddon: Good morning.
Joy Robson: Good morning.
Mr. Sneddon: Before you testified here today, did you review any documents?
Joy Robson: I did review my testimony from the grand jury last time, and the civil suit.
Mr. Sneddon: Mr. Feldman's grand jury --
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- deposition?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Good. I just want to go back and see if we can discuss some of the things you testified about this morning. As I recall, you first met the defendant at a dance contest in Australia, correct?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And that was in what year?
Joy Robson: That was in 1987.
Mr. Sneddon: And then your first trip to America was -- or maybe not the first trip, but in 1990, in January, you came here with the dance troupe, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And the time that you met Mr. Jackson in Australia was in connection with your son winning a dance contest?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And the occasion of you meeting Mr. Jackson was you were brought behind the stage with a lot of other people who were back there; is that right?
Joy Robson: It was a meet-and-greet situation, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: There wasn't a lot of substance to it?
Joy Robson: No, it was just, “How are you? It's a pleasure to meet you”, type of thing.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And then the next time that you meet Mr. Jackson is when you come to the United States in January of 1990, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you came here, there were no arrangements when you first came here to meet with Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And it was as a result of you making contact with Norma Stakos that you were able to make contact with Mr. Jackson, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And then you were invited up to the ranch, as I understand it, for a weekend?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: So you weren't there for an entire week?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Just for the weekend?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you went there for the weekend, the first night, your son and daughter spent the night in Mr. Jackson's bedroom, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, as I understand it, then, this was only the second time that you had met Mr. Jackson; is that correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And the first time you'd really met him on a one-on-one personal basis, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And how old was your son at this time?
Joy Robson: When we were at Neverland?
Mr. Sneddon: Yes, ma'am.
Joy Robson: He was seven.
Mr. Sneddon: Seven. How old was your daughter?
Joy Robson: Ten.
Mr. Sneddon: So your son and your daughter spent the first night with Mr. Jackson, and this was really the first night you'd ever met Mr. Jackson, that's correct, on a substantive level?
Joy Robson: Well, basically we'd spent the day with him, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: That was the first time?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you know that your son and daughter spent the night with Mr. Jackson in his bed?
Joy Robson: They did not.
Mr. Sneddon: They did not.
Joy Robson: They slept on the mezzanine level.
Mr. Sneddon: That's your belief?
Joy Robson: That's what they had told me.
Mr. Sneddon: So that -- if your son testified here in trial yesterday that he slept in the same bed with Michael Jackson with his sister, that would be inconsistent with what he told you before?
Joy Robson: That was the second night.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm asking you the first night.
Joy Robson: Well, that's -- what I've been told by my daughter and my son was the first night they slept on the mezzanine level.
Mr. Sneddon: So it would be correct that if your son testified to that yesterday, that on the first night he and his sister slept with Mr. Jackson in Mr. Jackson's bed, that statement would be inconsistent with what they had told you before?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Improper question, referring to the testimony.
The Court: I'll sustain the objection.
Mr. Sneddon: The second night your daughter did not stay with Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: She did.
Mr. Sneddon: The second night also?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Both nights?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall telling Mr. Feldman during the deposition that on the second night your daughter did not stay with the defendant?
Joy Robson: Yes, as a matter of fact, when I read that testimony, and my daughter has told me since that my memory was incorrect, that she did stay.
Mr. Sneddon: So you're basing your testimony here today on something your daughter told you as opposed to what you recall when you were under oath in a deposition?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, is it your testimony that your husband was present during the first visit?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you go back for a second weekend?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And was there a weekend between, or more than one week in between?
Joy Robson: There was a week in between.
Mr. Sneddon: So it was the following weekend you went back?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you went back on that occasion, who was present from your family?
Joy Robson: My husband, my daughter, my son, and my parents.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, on the occasion of the first visit, were your husband and your parents with you?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall testifying at a deposition that your parents and your husband were in San Francisco on a trip the first time you visited the ranch?
Joy Robson: No, they went -- we were all there for the weekend. They left -- we all left and went to San -- no, they went to San Francisco the second week. We went back to Los Angeles with Michael.
Mr. Sneddon: The question was, do you recall testifying to that?
Joy Robson: I wouldn't have testified to that.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, during that first visit, the first weekend that you were at the ranch, did the subject of your son going on a trip to Japan come up?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: So this would have been on the first day or the second day?
Joy Robson: I don't recall, I'm sorry.
Mr. Sneddon: One of those two days, in any case?
Joy Robson: Possibly.
Mr. Sneddon: And the subject of the conversation was that you had agreed to allow your son to accompany Mr. Jackson on a trip to Japan if they wanted to go, correct?
Joy Robson: I think we talked about it.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, did you agree to allow him to go with Mr. Jackson on a trip to Japan?
Joy Robson: I can't remember really. I think I may have, but we decided not to.
Mr. Sneddon: Mr. Jackson decided he would rather spend time with your son than go to Japan?
Joy Robson: I think the decision was Wade preferred to stay here. Stay at Neverland.
Mr. Sneddon: So it wasn't Mr. Jackson's decision. It was Wade's decision?
Joy Robson: It was Wade's decision.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall testifying in the deposition with Mr. Feldman that that was Mr. Jackson's decision to decide not to go to Japan, because he wanted to stay and have the time with your son?
Joy Robson: I think what happened was that Wade was given the choice.
Mr. Sneddon: Move to strike, Your Honor.
The Court: Stricken.
Joy Robson: I don't remember testifying to that.
Mr. Sneddon: During the first weekend trip to Neverland, did you go to Toys-R-Us?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Was that the second weekend?
Joy Robson: I never went to Toys-R-Us.
Mr. Sneddon: Did your children go to Toys-R-Us?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Which one of those weekends did they go?
Joy Robson: I don't recall.
Mr. Sneddon: But you do recall a trip?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And they went with Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And it was after hours, the store was closed?
Joy Robson: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: And they were allowed to buy anything -- or allowed to get anything they wanted and Mr. Jackson paid for it, correct?
Joy Robson: I think so.
Mr. Sneddon: So as I understand it, then, it's your testimony that if Mr. Jackson had wanted to go to Japan with your son, on this first time that you'd met him, that you would have allowed that?
Joy Robson: I doubt that --
Mr. Sneddon: You had agreed to that?
Joy Robson: I don't think so. I don't think I would have agreed to that.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall testifying in your deposition that you had agreed to allow him to go to Japan?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: You had decided early on in your son's career, or life, actually, that you wanted to get him into the entertainment business, correct?
Joy Robson: He decided. Not me.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, he was five years old.
Joy Robson: Yes. He made that decision at five.
Mr. Sneddon: At five. It was all his decision?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And you were going to do everything you could as a good mother to try to support that decision, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you felt that your having a good relationship or connection with the defendant in this case could promote that career; isn't that correct?
Joy Robson: That's -- you're putting words in my mouth. I've never said that.
Mr. Sneddon: I didn't ask you whether you said it or not. I asked you if that's what you were thinking.
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: You weren't thinking that at all?
Joy Robson: Not at all.
Mr. Sneddon: You weren't thinking that Mr. Jackson could help propel your son in an entertainment career?
Joy Robson: That was not my motive.
Mr. Sneddon: I -- I'm not trying to --
Joy Robson: Yes, you are.
Mr. Sneddon: -- demean your motives. No, I'm not, ma'am. I'm asking a simple question. Did you, in your mind, think that by having a friendship and a connection with Mr. Jackson that could help promote your son's career?
Joy Robson: I can't answer that, because I don't think that that -- you're make -- you're trying to make me say that that was my basis for our friendship, and that's not true.
Mr. Sneddon: Move to strike as nonresponsive.
The Court: Stricken.
Mr. Sneddon: I asked you a question about whose decision it was to cancel the trip to Japan. And I asked you if it was, in fact, Mr. Jackson -- that you had stated previously in your testimony it was Mr. Jackson, and you said you had no recollection of that, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you have a chance to review your deposition for Mr. Feldman prior to coming to court here today?
Joy Robson: I don't remember reading that.
Mr. Sneddon: Would it help you to refresh your recollection if I showed you the deposition?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: With the Court's permission, Your Honor.
The Court: You may.
Mr. Sneddon: Or Mr. Mesereau? Bob?
Mr. Mesereau: That's okay.
Mr. Sneddon: The procedure is you just read that to yourself quietly, and then I'll ask you a question, okay? And I want to direct your attention to page 181, and from lines 4 to line 9. And you can read anything else you want.
Joy Robson: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Having read that, does that refresh your recollection as to whose idea it was to cancel the trip to Japan?
Joy Robson: Well, it says that Wade was given the choice, and Wade preferred to stay at Neverland.
Mr. Sneddon: It says, “After the first weekend that we were there, he cancelled the trip because he wanted to stay and spend some time with us”, does it not?
Joy Robson: If you read further down.
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah, it says, “But he asked to go on this trip with your son”, and “I offered to let Wade go with him”?
Joy Robson: Further.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you want me to read the whole thing?
Joy Robson: No, just a couple, few more lines.
Mr. Sneddon: It doesn't get any better.
Joy Robson: Just a few more lines. It will say exactly what I said.
Mr. Sneddon: And then Wade had a choice of going to Japan or staying at Neverland, and he chose to stay?
Joy Robson: Yeah. That's what I said, Wade was given the choice. And he decided to stay at Neverland.
Mr. Sneddon: But it was the defendant's choice not to go to Japan, as you testified.
Joy Robson: He had a business trip and he cancelled it, and because Wade decided to stay at Neverland, but it was Wade's choice.
Mr. Sneddon: Thank you. After this trip, you went back to Australia, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And before we get to when you come back, which I think is in May of 1990, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. I want to ask you a few things about the tour of the house. And when you went to the house at Neverland Ranch, did you go throughout the entire house?
Joy Robson: The first trip?
Mr. Sneddon: Yes, ma'am.
Joy Robson: Actually, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: So you were shown the entire house?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Including Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Joy Robson: Well, actually, we arrived before Mr. Jackson, my parents and I. And Mark Quindoy showed us through the house.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Joy Robson: I don't think we went into Michael's bedroom initially.
Mr. Sneddon: At some point during that tour or during that weekend, did you go into Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: When you go into Mr. Jackson's bedroom, you walk down a hallway before you get to the entrance to the door to his bedroom, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And as you go down that hallway and you approach the door, a little chime goes off, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And the door cannot be opened from the outside, correct, it's locked?
Joy Robson: I think so, yes. From memory.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you went through the rest of the house, did you find any chimes that went off in any of the other rooms in the house?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And it's true, is it not, that none of the other doors in the house had locks on them?
Joy Robson: There was no one else staying in any of the other rooms.
Mr. Sneddon: No, I asked you whether there were any other rooms in the house where you had to have somebody from inside open the door in order to get into the room?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: So you were aware of the fact that at the time that you allowed your children to sleep with Mr. Jackson on the first day or night that you met him, that those children were going to be in a location which you could not get to without somebody from the inside opening the door, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Is there something funny about that?
Joy Robson: I just -- it's not a problem.
Mr. Sneddon: I can understand. You weren't concerned about it at all?
Joy Robson: Not at all.
Mr. Sneddon: Somebody you just met?
Joy Robson: I -- I think there's a certain trust that we developed immediately. Nothing ever crossed my mind that there would be a problem there.
Mr. Sneddon: In May, when you came back, it was for the purpose of your son participating in an L.A. Gear commercial?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And who arranged for him to be in that commercial?
Joy Robson: Michael.
Mr. Sneddon: And Mr. Jackson paid his way over here, correct?
Joy Robson: L.A. Gear paid.
Mr. Sneddon: And how did you -- how was yours paid?
Joy Robson: L.A. Gear. He was a minor.
Mr. Sneddon: L.A. Gear paid for that?
Joy Robson: Yes, they have to if a minor's working.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall testifying at your deposition that that was paid for by Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: I testified that L.A. Gear paid for it. I read that when I reviewed it.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at the time that you came over here for the L.A. Gear commercial, you were staying in The Holiday Inn?
Joy Robson: Yes. In Westwood.
Mr. Sneddon: And you were here for approximately six weeks?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And Mr. Jackson had a condo right across the street?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you testified before, I believe, that during that six-week period on at least half of the occasions that your son was with Mr. Jackson in Mr. Jackson's bedroom in that condo, correct?
Joy Robson: I think so.
Mr. Sneddon: And on a couple of those occasions, you actually were in the condo with them and you and your daughter, or you, slept on the floor; do you recall that?
Joy Robson: I think that was the first trip that my daughter and I slept on the floor. It wasn't during that time.
Mr. Sneddon: The first trip back in January?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Was there a time that you visited Mr. Jackson in his condo in January?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, these visits to The Holiday -- these visits to Mr. Jackson when you were staying at The Holiday Inn, many of those calls from Mr. Jackson were very late at night; isn't that correct?
Joy Robson: Yes, he was working.
Mr. Sneddon: Move to strike as nonresponsive, Your Honor.
The Court: I'll strike the last -- after “Yes”.
Mr. Sneddon: And he would call, and on some occasions you would walk your son across the street, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you'd leave him there and go back to the hotel?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And there was just he and Mr. Jackson together?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you knew that at that particular point in time, that he was sleeping with Mr. Jackson in Mr. Jackson's bed, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: When you came over to make the L.A. Gear commercial, did your husband come with you?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: At this point in time, were you and your husband separated?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And your daughter didn't come with you?
Joy Robson: No. She was in school.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, during the six-month period, I want to just concentrate on the period that we're talking about, the May visit, you also visited the ranch on occasion, did you not?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you visited the ranch on those occasions, you slept in the guest cottage, correct?
Joy Robson: No, I slept in the house.
Mr. Sneddon: And where in the house?
Joy Robson: In the rose bedroom. In the rose bedroom.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And your son slept with Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, do you recall an incident that occurred on Mother's Day during 1990 on a trip to the ranch?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you were upset, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you were crying at one point?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And the reason for that was that you had not seen your son all day, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And it was Mother's Day?
Joy Robson: That's right.
Mr. Sneddon: And you found out that the reason that you hadn't seen your son that day was because he had been sleeping all day, correct?
Joy Robson: I think so. Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: And you spoke to some people at the ranch about your feelings, did you not, one of the employees?
Joy Robson: I think someone asked me if I was okay.
Mr. Sneddon: And you told them that you felt that your son would rather be with Michael Jackson than with you, correct?
Joy Robson: I don't remember saying that.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know somebody by the name of Charli Michaels?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And who is Charli Michaels?
Joy Robson: I think she worked security at the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you tell Charli Michaels that you felt that the defendant, Michael Jackson, was separating you from your son?
Joy Robson: I don't recall saying it.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall testifying to that in your deposition with Mr. Feldman?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Would it refresh your recollection if I showed you a copy of the deposition?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Joy Robson: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Does that refresh your recollection?
Joy Robson: I don't remember saying it, but I testified to it.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry?
Joy Robson: I said I don't remember saying it, but obviously I testified back then about it. I don't remember saying it.
Mr. Sneddon: You said that Wade would rather be with Michael than with yourself and you were upset about it?
Joy Robson: Well, I read it, but I honestly don't remember saying it.
Mr. Sneddon: At the time that you were at the ranch on the first occasions that you were there, to your knowledge, did Michael Jackson have a personal maid?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And who was that?
Joy Robson: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember meeting anybody by the name of Blanca Francia?
Joy Robson: I remember her being there. I think she did clean Michael's room, I think.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the time that you -- let me just go through this real quickly so we can get up to the time frame involved here. You came back in May of 1990, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you were here for six weeks, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And then you came back again in February of 1991, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: For about seven days?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And during the time that you were here in 1991, you spent time on the ranch, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: You and your son?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And then in September 1991 -- well, let me go back. When you came here in February of 1991 for seven days, did your husband come with you?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: When you visited in September of 1991, you came permanently, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: You had no intention of going back to Australia?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And you had your son and your daughter with you?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And your husband did not come?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And at that point you had been separated from your husband?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And then from that point, from September of 1991 up till, let's just say, September 1993 - okay? - the time frame involved, you and your son spent a great deal of time with Michael Jackson, you were around him a lot, correct?
Joy Robson: I don't think so.
Mr. Sneddon: You were not at the ranch on a number of occasions during 1991?
Joy Robson: My memory is in the entire time we've lived here since 1991, we've only been at the ranch with Michael on four occasions in 14 years.
Mr. Sneddon: Four occasions?
Joy Robson: Every other time we've been here without him.
Mr. Sneddon: Would that be the same for your son?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: So --
Joy Robson: He came one -- all the time by himself.
Mr. Sneddon: You testified that you've been out at the ranch on an average of about four times?
Joy Robson: Four times a year, but Michael was never there.
Mr. Sneddon: Was that all the way through today?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: He's never there when you go there?
Joy Robson: Very rarely. I can only remember four times in 14 years that we've been there with him since we have lived here.
Mr. Sneddon: So when you were testifying for Mr. Mesereau and you were talking about ever seeing any inappropriate touching, there were only on four occasions that you were even at the ranch to see anything, correct?
Joy Robson: Since we've lived here, 1991.
Mr. Sneddon: You didn't see anything before that, did you?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall having a conversation in which you -- with June Chandler? Do you know who June Chandler is?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: June Chandler is whom?
Joy Robson: Jordie Chandler's mother.
Mr. Sneddon: You've met June Chandler?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: You've met Jordan Chandler?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Jordan Chandler was at Neverland Valley Ranch at the same time as your son, correct?
Joy Robson: We were all there together on one weekend.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And do you recall testifying to a situation in which your son, Wade, was upset because Jordan Chandler was going to spend the night in Michael Jackson's room and Wade had to stay with you in the guest cottage?
Joy Robson: I don't remember that. I remember reading it in my testimony, but I don't remember him being upset.
Mr. Sneddon: Maybe I'll use a different word. Disappointed?
Joy Robson: Possibly.
Mr. Sneddon: But you do remember the incident?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: You don't?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: So when you said you read your transcript, it's in your transcript, right?
Joy Robson: I read it in the transcript, but it's 12 years ago. I don't remember it.
Mr. Sneddon: I understand. Do you have any reason to believe that you would testify to something under oath in a deposition that wasn't true at the time that you said it?
Joy Robson: No, I just don't remember it now.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Do you recall a conversation in which you told June Chandler that some day Jordan was going to be replaced by another one of Michael Jackson's friends?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you referred to these people as “special friends”, correct?
Joy Robson: According to my transcript, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: You don't ever remember using that phrase now?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: But you did use it in your transcript back in 1993?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And in a conversation you told June Chandler that with these special friends, that when Mr. Jackson moves on to the next special friend, that it has a tremendous emotional impact on the children when they're no longer the favorite, correct?
Joy Robson: As does everybody when they lose a friend.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry?
Joy Robson: As does everyone if you lose a friend or a friend becomes friendly with somebody else.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you not, in that conversation, specifically refer to the situation where a young child was a friend of Mr. Jackson's and is replaced by another young child and that that has -- and you were reflecting upon the emotional problems it creates for that child?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the time that you were at the ranch -- you described a situation this morning for the jury, you told them that when you go to Neverland it's like walking through a door and you forget all your worries and all your cares.
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: That's a paraphrase so.... Now, it's also true that what happens at Neverland Ranch, is it not, that when children come on the ranch, they sort of lose all of their rules and guidelines for conduct?
Joy Robson: Well, that depends on the child.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. With regard to the time you were at the ranch, the children that you saw were your son --
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- correct? And your daughter, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you saw Jordan Chandler, correct?
Joy Robson: Once.
Mr. Sneddon: And you saw Macaulay Culkin?
Joy Robson: I don't think I've been there with Macaulay Culkin.
Mr. Sneddon: Brett Barnes?
Joy Robson: I've never been there with Brett.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the conduct of your son when he was on the ranch, did he get carried away, do things there that he didn't do other places in terms of manners?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: He was perfectly --
Joy Robson: My son was always respectful, always considered it a privilege to be there.
Mr. Sneddon: Did he ever do anything that you would think that would not be a good thing to do?
Joy Robson: Not that I'm aware of.
Mr. Sneddon: Are you aware that he was throwing pebbles or rocks at the lions with Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: I think that's been paraphrased. I think what they did is they threw them at the cage, not the lion.
Mr. Sneddon: Move to strike as nonresponsive, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled. Next question.
Mr. Sneddon: So you make a distinction between throwing them at the cage and the lion itself?
Joy Robson: Absolutely. They were just trying to make the lion roar. All it did was make a noise.
Mr. Sneddon: I see. How about -- does your son ride the go-carts there?
Joy Robson: Go-carts or the golf carts?
Mr. Sneddon: The golf carts.
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Ever have any problems with getting in any accidents while he was there or driving too fast or being admonished for driving too fast?
Joy Robson: He may have been admonished for driving fast. He was never in an accident.
Mr. Sneddon: The other children that I've mentioned, did you seem them acting out at all at Neverland Ranch?
Joy Robson: I heard stories. I've never seen it.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you testified about Mr. Jackson and his special friends in your deposition, you mentioned that the first of the ones that you knew about was your son Wade in 1990, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And then in 1991 was Macaulay Culkin, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And in 1992, Brett Barnes, correct?
Joy Robson: I think so.
Mr. Sneddon: And then in 1993, towards the end, was Jordan Chandler, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to Brett Barnes, you went to Chicago with your -- or I should ask you this: Did you go to Chicago with your son to shoot a commercial?
Joy Robson: A music video, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you go there?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And with your son?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you meet Brett Barnes there?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And was Brett Barnes with the defendant?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And in fact, Brett Barnes was staying with the defendant in the defendant's room, correct?
Joy Robson: I don't know.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see whether or not -- did you meet any of the Barnes' parents there?
Joy Robson: His mother and his sister were there on the set.
Mr. Sneddon: You sure of that?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And was it your -- you became aware of the fact that Mr. Jackson referred to some of these young boys as his cousins, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you were asked why Mr. Jackson referred to them as his cousins, correct?
Joy Robson: I was asked?
Mr. Sneddon: Didn't you say that Mr. Jackson used the term “cousins” because he didn't want the kids to get jealous of each other?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, do you recall an incident that occurred where you were supposed to catch a plane and you couldn't find your son?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And the fact is that you hadn't seen or heard from your son for two or three days?
Joy Robson: I think two.
Mr. Sneddon: And he had been with Mr. Jackson during that entire time; correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And I believe what you said was you were upset and you were hurt by this, correct?
Joy Robson: I don't remember that.
Mr. Sneddon: You called a number of people trying to locate your son, correct?
Joy Robson: I was trying to call Michael, and he was in the recording studio, not answering, not receiving phone calls. And I think I called Neverland to see if they had gone to Neverland.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, you called Neverland and you got the Quindoy -- Mr. Quindoy, correct?
Joy Robson: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know who Mr. Quindoy is?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you were very upset and wanted your son to be returned so he could make the flight?
Joy Robson: I called to ask if they perhaps were at Neverland. That's all I remember.
Mr. Sneddon: You don't remember saying that you needed your son returned, that you were very upset and you were going to miss the plane?
Joy Robson: No, I don't.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you call Norma Stakos trying to locate your son?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: So just to recap just a little bit, when you were in Las Vegas, you went there by jet. Do you know whose jet that was?
Joy Robson: Steve Wynn.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry?
Joy Robson: Steve Wynn's jet.
Mr. Sneddon: Steve Wynn. And you went to a hotel?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Which is The Mirage?
Joy Robson: Mirage.
Mr. Sneddon: And you stayed in a suite?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And except for the night -- or the day when you all stayed in bed watching cartoons, eating popcorn, your son slept with Mr. Jackson and you slept in the other room?
Joy Robson: It was one night, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And now, when you came to the United States in 1991, in September, you came here on a -- originally you came here on a visa, temporary visa?
Joy Robson: A six-month visitor's visa.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And your goal was to stay here permanently?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And your goal was that you came because Mr. Jackson had indicated to you that he was going to help your son in his career, correct?
Joy Robson: I'm not sure about that.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember testifying in your deposition that the defendant had arranged deals for Wade with his -- Sony records, Sony movies and Sony T.V.?
Joy Robson: No, that came after the fact. After we'd been here. He didn't promise anything when we came. He actually came to work on the “Black and White” video.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, move to strike the comments. No question pending.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll object, Your Honor, the prosecutor didn't allow her to complete her answer.
The Court: Sustained. The request to strike is denied.
Mr. Mesereau: May the witness be allowed to complete her answer, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes. Do you want your answer read back as far as you gave it?
Joy Robson: No. He came here originally in 1991 to work on the “Black or White” video, and we stayed after that. That was the reason for coming in the first place.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. I want to ask it again, just to be clear. Did Mr. Jackson tell you, before you left Australia, that he would help you in any way he could with his record company, his movie company, and his television company, and these were three deals that he had organized with Sony, correct?
Joy Robson: There were no deals organized. He did say he would do what he could to help, but there were no deals organized.
Mr. Sneddon: Would it refresh your recollection if you looked at your testimony before the grand jury?
Joy Robson: There were no deals. If I testified -- I don't think I would have testified to that.
Mr. Sneddon: Would it refresh your recollection if you looked at it to see whether you testified to that?
Joy Robson: Yes. Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Does that refresh your recollection as to what you told the grand jury?
Joy Robson: No. I don't remember that.
Mr. Sneddon: You don't remember telling them that he'd organized three deals for your son?
Joy Robson: Well, he didn't, so I don't remember it.
Mr. Sneddon: But that's what you said?
Joy Robson: I don't know what I meant there. There was nothing organized.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you say in the grand jury that you considered these arrangements to be a personal commitment from Mr. Jackson directly to you?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: You didn't say that?
Joy Robson: I don't remember saying that. There was no commitment.
Mr. Sneddon: May I approach, Your Honor?
Mr. Sneddon: Would it refresh your recollection if I showed you your testimony before the grand jury?
Joy Robson: Yes.
The Court: Yes, you may approach.
Mr. Sneddon: May I approach?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: It's just one line. Or two lines. Does that refresh your recollection as to what you told the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: It does not at all?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: But you did say that?
Joy Robson: Obviously I did. I have no memory of it.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you came here in September 1991, Mr. Jackson also helped you with some rent for the first month, correct?
Joy Robson: That was part of the video -- you're always housed when you come to work on a music video.
Mr. Sneddon: I think the question was did Mr. Jackson pay for your rent the first month you were here?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you came here in September, you also went to work for MJJ Productions, correct?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: You -- let's see if I get this right. You had a job in a -- cosmetics?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And because you were here on a certain kind of visa, they couldn't pay you; is that correct?
Joy Robson: They did pay me, but they paid me through Michael Jackson's company.
Mr. Sneddon: So your checks were from MJJ Productions?
Joy Robson: Well, that makes it sound like MJJ Productions was paying me. They were not.
Mr. Sneddon: I just -- the question was, the checks came from MJJ Productions?
Joy Robson: They were diverted through Michael Jackson's company.
Mr. Sneddon: In other words, your company would pay them the money, and then Mr. Jackson's company would pay you the money?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Just in all fairness. I'm not trying to trick you.
Joy Robson: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: And that arrangement was worked out with the approval and the help of Mr. Jackson, correct?
Joy Robson: I think so. I'm -- I mean, I didn't speak to him about it. I spoke to Norma Stakos about it.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall telling and testifying to the fact that what actually happened in September of 1991 is that Mr. Jackson was your sponsor when you came to the United States with your son?
Joy Robson: Not initially. We were here for six months and then he offered, he offered to sponsor after we arrived.
Mr. Sneddon: You mentioned to this jury that at some point in time, you realized that your son was spending time in bed with Mr. Jackson, correct, sleeping in the same bed with Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And in fact, you indicated in prior testimony that you realized that and knew that early on in the relationship between your son and Mr. Jackson, correct?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. We're almost done. Let's fast-forward a little bit to 1993. You were -- you were at the ranch in 1993 and Jordan Chandler was there, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And in 1993, that was the occasion of you having the conversation with Mrs. Chandler that you've described to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury previously, correct?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And during this particular point in time, not January, but in 1993, at some point, your son was in the process of putting together an album deal where he -- he or somebody with him would cut some records, correct?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And the negotiations began on that deal when?
Joy Robson: From memory, June of '93.
Mr. Sneddon: And I think you described that process as about a six-month process?
Joy Robson: Well, it varies. But that one took that long, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And the deal was finally signed on December 6th, 1993, correct?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And the deal was signed with -- with MJJ Productions, correct?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And in the deal, your son -- not your son -- the total deal was for $100,000, correct?
Joy Robson: The production company.
Mr. Sneddon: Right. And your son's share of that was $30,000?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And 15,000 of that was given as an advance?
Joy Robson: I think so.
Mr. Sneddon: And this was in December of 1993, correct?
Joy Robson: I don't really remember. I think according to the transcripts that's what it said.
Mr. Sneddon: And you took -- well, let me go back. There was a period of time -- where were you on Thanksgiving? Do you remember where you went Thanksgiving? Did you go to New York Thanksgiving?
Joy Robson: I read the transcript. We were in New York recording.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. With who?
Joy Robson: With the production company and they were recording for the album.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And up until the point of Thanksgiving of 1993, the record deal had not been finalized yet between your son and their representatives and Mr. Jackson's company, correct?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And there had been -- there had been some delay in the signing of the contracts, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And one of the things that had happened in between the time that you first started negotiating the contracts in June or July and December 6 when you finally signed the contract with Mr. Jackson's company was that Jordan Chandler had gone to the Department of Social Services in the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and reported that he'd been molested by Michael Jackson, correct?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Objection; assumes facts not in evidence.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm asking what she's aware of, Your Honor, and it has to do with motive and bias.
The Court: Just a moment.
Mr. Mesereau: No foundation.
The Court: The objection is overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Sneddon: You were aware of that, were you not?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And in fact -- well, let me ask you this: You know a person, or knew a person by the name of Anthony Pellicano, did you not?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And Mr. Pellicano was Mr. Jackson's private investigator, correct?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; beyond the scope.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Sneddon: And Mr. Pellicano was the one who was holding up the deal, correct?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: He told you that?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And the deal was finally signed on December 6th because the defendant intervened and said, “Go ahead and sign the deal”, correct?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: In the meantime, Mr. Pellicano had given you a $12,000 loan, correct?
Joy Robson: 10,000.
Mr. Sneddon: 10,000, you're right. Absolutely. Pardon me. $10,000 loan?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you ever repay that?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: When?
Joy Robson: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you have any proof?
Joy Robson: Probably. I don't remember when it was.
Mr. Sneddon: When's the last time you saw Mr. Pellicano?
Joy Robson: I haven't seen him since. I have not seen him since '93.
Mr. Sneddon: Since '93. So it's your testimony you paid him back in '93?
Joy Robson: It was sometime after that.
Mr. Sneddon: Mr. Pellicano was Mr. Jackson's investigator and you had at least four conversations with him, interviews, you and your son, correct?
Joy Robson: Probably.
Mr. Sneddon: And that was after Mr. Jackson got back in December of 1993?
Joy Robson: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: You were asked by Mr. Feldman to give a statement to an investigator, and you refused -- for his office, and you refused to do that, didn't you?
Joy Robson: I don't remember. I'm sorry.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember the Los Angeles Police Department coming to your apartment?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you didn't give them a statement either, did you?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: You gave them a very brief one and then said you had to go somewhere. Isn't that what happened?
Joy Robson: No, they were trying to interview Wade without me and I told them they were not to do that.
Mr. Sneddon: Was there some concern on your part that trained law enforcement officers shouldn't talk to somebody who could possibly be a suspect (sic) of a crime?
Joy Robson: I was concerned of manipulation.
Mr. Sneddon: That the consequence, law enforcement would manipulate your son?
Joy Robson: Absolutely.
Mr. Sneddon: You felt that your son could be manipulated easily?
Joy Robson: No, but I wasn't going to take that chance. He was ten.
Mr. Sneddon: You weren't concerned about the fact that the defendant in this case, Mr. Jackson, might manipulate your son?
Joy Robson: No concern at all that he would manipulate my son.
Mr. Sneddon: But two law enforcement officers, you thought they would?
Joy Robson: Possibly. I don't know them. I know Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, you received another -- you received actually a loan from Mr. Jackson for $10,000 in 1992, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: You never paid that one back?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you receive another loan from Mr. Jackson after the record contract was signed?
Joy Robson: I don't think so.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall telling an investigator that you had gotten a loan from Mr. Jackson for $10,000 and you tried to buy a car? Do you remember that?
Joy Robson: He paid -- he paid for the balance of the car.
Mr. Sneddon: Mr. Jackson did?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: That was $10,000?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, in December of 1993, after the allegations with Jordan Chandler had surfaced, Mr. Jackson came back to the United States, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And on -- to your knowledge, on the very first night he was back he called your son, correct?
Joy Robson: He called me.
Mr. Sneddon: He called you?
Joy Robson: I think so. From memory.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember testifying that you weren't at the house when the call was made, that you were out with some ladies?
Joy Robson: I do remember reading that, I'm sorry.
Mr. Sneddon: So you weren't there?
Joy Robson: Possibly.
Mr. Sneddon: You came home, and then both of you, late in the night, drove to Neverland Valley Ranch, correct?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: When you got to Neverland Valley Ranch, it was about 1:30 in the morning, correct?
Joy Robson: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: When you got there, you went to the guest quarters and your son went to Mr. Jackson's bedroom, correct?
Joy Robson: I don't remember where I slept, but he did go to Michael's bedroom.
Mr. Sneddon: But he went inside the house?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Where was your son going to school when school started in September of 1993?
Joy Robson: I think he was doing home schooling by then.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember him at some point in time going to school with a family named the Kennedys?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: He had a close friend?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember a young boy by the name of Teja, T-e-j-a?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Is the reason that you took your son out of school because the kids at school had found out that he had been sleeping with Michael Jackson and they were making cruel statements about him?
Joy Robson: I took Wade out of school after the fourth grade. He was -- it was before any of this surfaced.
Mr. Sneddon: So he was not in school during the fifth and sixth grades in the valley?
Joy Robson: Never been in school in the valley.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. May I have a moment? Excuse me just a second, Your Honor, I'm trying to find a report. Okay, let's just do it this way. Ahh, here it is.
Mr. Sneddon: Kenneth Clark, I'm sorry. Do you know Kenneth Clark.
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: You don't remember Kenneth Anthony Clark being a good friend of your son's?
Joy Robson: Never heard of him.
Mr. Sneddon: Did your son ever go to Garden Street School in West Hollywood?
Joy Robson: He went there for the fourth grade.
Mr. Sneddon: Just the fourth grade?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Not the fourth, fifth and sixth grades?
Joy Robson: No. He started with Laurel Springs School when he was -- when he got the record deal.
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah, 1993.
Joy Robson: He was fifth grade.
Mr. Sneddon: So it's your testimony that your son was only there in the fourth grade?
Joy Robson: From memory. Maybe part of fifth.
Mr. Sneddon: And is your testimony that your son never received -- that the home school didn't start at Laurel Springs because of the fact that your son was being teased at school because people found out he was sleeping in bed with Mr. Michael Jackson?
Joy Robson: He's never been teased at school. He started home-schooling because he was a recording artist and could not be in school. He was traveling.
Mr. Sneddon: I just asked you is that the case?
Joy Robson: That's the absolute case.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Thank you. No further questions.
The Court: Redirect?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please, Your Honor.

Mr. Mesereau: Miss Robson, in response to the prosecutor's questions with regard to manipulation you said, “I know Mr. Jackson”. Do you remember saying that?
Joy Robson: Absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: Please tell the jury what you meant by that.
Joy Robson: Well, I've known Michael for a long time. I know him very well. I've spent many hours talking to him about everything. I feel like he's a member of my family. I know him very well. I trust him. I trust him with my children.
Mr. Mesereau: Why?
Joy Robson: Because Michael is a very special person. Unless you know him, it's hard to understand. He's not the boy next door. He's Michael Jackson. He's very -- he's just a very unique personality. He loves children. And he has a very pure love for children. And to know him is to love him and to trust him.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did you begin to know Michael Jackson?
Joy Robson: I felt like I knew him from the very beginning. He just has that wonderful way of making you feel at home; that I felt like I knew him very early on. But particularly in the two years when we were living in Australia before we moved here, and I talked to him every day. We had very long conversations about everything that was going on in his life and my life and my children's lives. And you get to know someone very well when you talk to someone several hours a day over a two-year period. And then once we moved here, too, we continued that. We've always been able to talk about just about anything.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you about Mother's Day at Neverland?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Remember that?
Joy Robson: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: And you learned that Wade and Mr. Jackson were in a recording studio that day, correct?
Joy Robson: Not that day. That was -- that was the time that we were staying in Westwood, and Wade and I had our ticket booked to return to Australia. And he had been at the recording studio with Michael for a couple of days, and I just hadn't heard from them. I know that they were working long hours, and then they'd take off again the next day. And I was getting --
Mr. Sneddon: Move to strike as a narrative, Your Honor. Objection.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember anything else about that day at the recording studio?
Joy Robson: No, just -- I had called Norma looking for him, and she found them. She said they were in the recording studio and, “Michael is bringing him back to you. They're on their way”.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, did your son spend a lot of time with Michael Jackson at recording studios?
Joy Robson: Often, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And why was that?
Joy Robson: Because Wade was interested in being a recording artist, he was interested in being a producer. He was learning. He loved to be around that and absorb that. He was like a sponge. And he -- that was the relationship that he and Michael had. It was -- a lot of it was a working relationship and Michael was teaching him.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you questions suggesting that you were allowing your son to be with Michael just to further his career. Is that true?
Joy Robson: Absolutely not.
Mr. Mesereau: What do you mean?
Joy Robson: He was -- as I say, he was learning things from Michael. Michael was teaching him everything he knew, and he couldn't -- that was part of the friendship, but it was more of a friendship than anything else. And I certainly never asked Michael for anything where my son's career was concerned. I believe in my son, and I moved here for him to further his career. I believed that he could do that.
Mr. Sneddon: Objection, Your Honor, narrative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you allow your son to spend time with Michael Jackson learning the entertainment business?
Joy Robson: Absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: Why did you do that?
Joy Robson: Because he was learning from the best. Michael offered to teach him everything he could. He believed in him, so why would I not?
Mr. Mesereau: Now, your son has had a pretty successful entertainment career so far, right?
Joy Robson: He has.
Mr. Mesereau: And has he worked exclusively with Michael Jackson or has he done other things on his own?
Joy Robson: He's done most of it on his own.
Mr. Mesereau: What has he done?
Joy Robson: He's become a choreographer. He started --
Mr. Sneddon: Object as immaterial, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, the prosecutor suggested that you were making decisions about what to do with your children because Michael Jackson could help their careers, correct?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object as argumentative and leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever allow Wade to be with Michael Jackson only because Michael Jackson could help his career?
Mr. Sneddon: Object as leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Joy Robson: Never. We were friends first.
Mr. Mesereau: Why did you allow Wade to spend a lot of time with Michael Jackson?
Mr. Sneddon: Object.
Mr. Mesereau: Please tell the jury.
Mr. Sneddon: Asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: Please tell that to the jury.
Joy Robson: They enjoyed each other. They -- they were very similar people. I remember Michael telling me early on that it was like looking in the mirror, he saw himself all over again. His interest was because he saw Wade's potential. And Wade loved everything that Michael did and wanted to learn as much as he could.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever lose your trust in Michael Jackson during any point in time that your son was with him?
Joy Robson: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. Jackson ever do anything that made you suspicious about his behavior towards your son Wade?
Joy Robson: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. Jackson ever do anything that made you suspicious about his behavior towards your daughter?
Joy Robson: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you questions about children being jealous if Michael Jackson had another friend who was a child. Do you remember those questions?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Please tell the jury what you meant.
Joy Robson: It's like any child who has a favorite uncle or someone in the family that everyone wants to be around. And Michael's the sort of person that everybody wants to be around. He has that sort of aura. So naturally, when he was spending time with one child, another child would be jealous. It's the same in any family, if you spend time with one child more than the other.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you questions about Michael Jackson having special friends who were children. Do you remember that?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what did you mean by that?
Joy Robson: Well, you know, there would be people who would spend time with him at particular times more so than others. It didn't mean that he didn't still spend time with all of them. They were all friends of his. But when he spent particularly more time with one than the other, then they were special for the time.
Mr. Mesereau: Based upon what you've observed of Mr. Jackson, would it be accurate to say that all over the world children flock to him, don't they?
Joy Robson: Absolutely.
Mr. Sneddon: Object. Immaterial; leading.
The Court: Overruled. The answer is in.
Mr. Mesereau: And have you seen children from time to time get jealous because Mr. Jackson is being nice to another child?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Has that ever appeared unusual to you?
Joy Robson: Not at all.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see something that you thought was very suspicious when one child would get jealous of Mr. Jackson's attention to another child?
Joy Robson: No, I think that's normal with children.
Mr. Mesereau: When you used the term “special friends”, what did you mean?
Joy Robson: I think just the one that he was spending time with for now. That he considered all of his friends special. I don't know why I would have said that. I don't remember saying “special”. But I imagine it would have meant just the child that he was spending time with now.
Mr. Mesereau: When you used the term “special friends”, did you mean to suggest anything criminal was going on?
Joy Robson: Absolutely not.
Mr. Mesereau: When you used the term “special friends”, did you mean to suggest that anything sexual was going on?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, that's a leading question. I object.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: The word “special”, you used that term, right?
Joy Robson: Apparently, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Why?
Joy Robson: Well, I guess because all children are special and Michael considers them all special. There's nothing -- no -- nothing necessarily of a bad connotation in that.
The Court: I think it's time for the break now.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh.
The Court: You just took that one breath too long.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: (To the jury) You know, I'm going to take -- you're going to get an extra five minutes because at the end of our break I want to talk to the attorneys. Just so you know, you'll have a little longer break. It's not a long item. Don't worry.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: I just know that you're about to call another witness, which, according to my list, would be Chantal Robson; is that correct?
Mr. Mesereau: That's correct, Your Honor.
The Court: And there was a motion to limit testimony on her and also on Karlee Barnes on the same documents. And I've reviewed those documents, and I'm not going to grant the motion. I'll decide the issues on a question-by-question basis. But for your guidance, it seems, based on the attached police reports, that the information that's in those reports would be the type of information that he would be allowed to ask about.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Zonen: Your Honor, we also filed a motion with regard to Lisbeth Barnes. Is that one that the Court will address at some time?
The Bailiff: You can't be heard.
The Court: The Lisbeth Barnes issue, I will rule on that on a case-by-case basis. But I will order that the -- that she not be allowed to give opinions about her -- her opinions about how vigorous, et cetera, a prosecutor Mr. Sneddon is. I've already ruled that's out of bounds, not an issue in this case. It's not going to be a personal attack on him.
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, if I could just ask for guidance on that issue. Excluding personal attacks, certainly we can discuss with Mr. Sneddon their willingness to cooperate, what he said to them, et cetera, about these issues without making it a personal attack, can't we?
The Court: Within limits.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
The Court: The line there -- there is a probative issue there, but the line about personal -- her opinions of him --
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
The Court: -- I won't allow that.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
The Court: So while we're doing -- I'm going to do one more that was there. Might as well cover it. I don't see this person on your list, though. You had a person named -- there was a question about witness Michael Viner, V-i-n-e-r.
Mr. Sneddon: That's --
Mr. Mesereau: Michael Viner. Michael Viner. V-i-n-e-r, Your Honor.
The Court: Yeah. He's not on the list, but --
Mr. Sanger: I should address that.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll address it.
The Court: What my ruling on that would be, I'm not going to allow him to testify about overhearing the opinion of Mr. Feldman as to veracity. That's not admissible.
Mr. Mesereau: If I may, Your Honor, I think we were going to file an opposition, which didn't get filed. Our position was going to be the prosecution allowed -- I believe, I will double-check.
The Court: I'll withhold that ruling if you intend to file an opposition.
Mr. Mesereau: We do.
The Court: That person's not on the list at this point. But that's where I was going with it based on just what the District Attorney had filed.
Mr. Sanger: It should be filed now.
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, may I address the Court on a matter that I indicated to the clerk that I wanted to take up with the Court?
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: And I was told I could do it at a later time.
The Court: All right. What is the issue?
Mr. Sneddon: Discovery. We have a --
The Court: Does it relate to any immediate --
Mr. Sneddon: Yes.
The Court: -- witness right now?
Mr. Sneddon: Yes. Not to this lady, but to the future of the day. And it -- I want to alert the Court that we have a very substantial problem, and I'd like to -- I know that the Court doesn't want to keep the jury waiting, but --
The Court: On which issue?
Mr. Sneddon: We got a list with three witnesses, Francine Orozco, Russ Birchim and Jimmy Van Norman. Francine Orozco --
The Court: What I'm going to do is -- what I'm thinking of doing is letting the jury go an hour or so early today, because there's another issue that Mr. Mesereau wants to take up, so that we can do that when they're not waiting in the hallway.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Your Honor, then I just want to ask one other thing. And while I don't want to hold things up, but I believe that this witness and the witnesses yesterday have testified to their opinion about character. And we filed the brief this morning, so I was just going to ask, when she's excused, that she's subject to re-call. If the Court agrees with us, then we can then cross-examine her further on those topics.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: Thank you.
The Court: The Court has not excused any witnesses yet. Our agreement was that the witnesses, unless specifically asked, I would not excuse them, they're still bound, because both parties have indicated they want to -- they may want to re-call witnesses. So no witnesses have been excused except where I've specifically excused them, and there are very few of those.
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, I understand. I wanted to make sure I preserved it as a witness coming back on cross-examination and not having to call her as my own witness. I believe that I would be entitled to cross-examine her on have-you-heard statements based on her testimony. That's all I was trying to do was just to preserve the record for that.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: Thank you.
The Court: I'll have the jury brought in.
Message: The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence and hearing of the jury:
The Court: All right. You may proceed.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Miss Robson, the prosecutor asked you questions about borrowing $10,000. Remember that?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Would you please explain why you borrowed $10,000?
Joy Robson: The first $10,000, we had been here for, I think, a year, 18 months. And it was a lot more difficult to establish ourselves here than I had anticipated, so Michael offered to help us out for a while. So we borrowed $10,000 at that point. The second one was a car. I had been here for a while. My credit from Australia cannot be transferred, so I had no established credit in the United States. I was listed as an employee because of the cosmetics company paying through Michael Jackson's company. Because I was being sponsored by MJJ Productions, I was listed as an employee of the company. So I had asked if the company would co-sign for my car because I was unable to get the credit to buy a car, and Michael just offered to pay for it rather than co-sign.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it -- as you recall, was it his idea to help you or was it your idea?
Joy Robson: I had asked for help. And he was there for me. He was a friend.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was there anything, as far as you know, improper or illegal about anything you did?
Joy Robson: Nothing.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. The prosecutor asked you some questions about whether or not you had borrowed other funds. Do you remember?
Joy Robson: Do you mean the Anthony Pellicano situation?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what were you referring to?
Joy Robson: Well, that was because the record label -- the deal had been held up, and the advance was something that we needed to survive. And because it was held up, Anthony Pellicano offered to loan the money to me until the balance came through from the record deal.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, did you ask Mr. Jackson for help from time to time?
Joy Robson: I asked a couple of occasions with the car and the initial 10,000.
Mr. Mesereau: And he did help you on those occasions?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you questions about your son's entertainment career. Did you ask for help from Mr. Jackson once in a while as far as your son's entertainment career was concerned?
Joy Robson: No. I had called a couple of time to see if -- when he was doing music videos, to see if he remembered Wade, because he said he would put Wade in his music video. To remind him more than anything. But that was all.
Mr. Mesereau: And to your knowledge, did Mr. Jackson help Wade with his career?
Joy Robson: Yes, he's always very supportive. He's always very interested in what Wade did with his career. He would check on him. He would ask him to send him -- keep him in touch and send -- when he was doing music production, he would ask him to send him demos of the music that he was producing so that he can listen to it and encourage him and teach him what he was doing correctly and not. Always very supportive, always very interested.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, were you allowing Wade to spend nights with Mr. Jackson because you just wanted to further his career?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Why were you letting Wade spend those evenings with Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: Those evenings just happened because they were having fun together. They would play till all hours of the night. They would watch music videos. They would watch cartoons. And they'd basically just go to sleep.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you do that with Mr. Jackson as well?
Joy Robson: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: How often?
Joy Robson: A couple of times.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. The prosecutor asked you questions about Wade and Michael throwing some pebbles at the lion cage. Do you recall that?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How -- when did you learn about Wade and Michael throwing some pebbles at a lion cage?
Joy Robson: I think Wade had told me about it at some point after the fact. He was basically telling me that he heard the lion roar. And it didn't roar very often, so I was surprised. And he told me what they did to make it roar.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, was it your impression that they were engaging in animal cruelty or anything?
Joy Robson: Absolutely not. That's the last thing that either of them would do.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object.
The Court: What was that?
Mr. Sneddon: I said I object. It calls for a conclusion. It's narrative. And it's leading.
Mr. Mesereau: I think the prosecutor asked her about her knowledge and state of mind.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm not objecting to the subject matter. I'm objecting to the form of the question.
The Court: All right. I'll sustain the objection. Strike the answer. Next question.
Mr. Mesereau: Who told you about Wade and Michael Jackson throwing some pebbles at the lion cage?
Joy Robson: Wade.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did he tell you about that?
Joy Robson: I think possibly a day or two after it happened, or that night. I really don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: And did he tell you that he had tried to be cruel to an animal?
Joy Robson: No. Wade loves animals.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he tell you that Michael Jackson had tried to be cruel to an animal?
Joy Robson: No. Michael is -- loves all animals as well. Neither of them would ever do that.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you questions about the word “cousin”. Do you recall those questions?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you hear Michael Jackson use the word “cousin” in describing children?
Joy Robson: Yes. He pretty much called everybody cousins, I think.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you know why he did that?
Joy Robson: No. That's just something that he -- I mean, I think at some point he may have said it so that they weren't jealous of each other, because that tended to happen.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever suspect there was something criminal about Mr. Jackson using the word “cousin”?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever think there was something sexual about Mr. Jackson referring to children as his cousin?
Joy Robson: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever think there was anything inappropriate about Mr. Jackson referring to various children as “my cousin”?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you questions about Brett Barnes. Do you know Brett Barnes?
Joy Robson: I don't know him. I'm associated with him.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How so?
Joy Robson: I met him once when he was in Chicago and Michael was shooting the “Jam” music video.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you maintain any communication with the Barnes family through the years?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Would you call the Barnes family good friends of your family?
Joy Robson: Not at all.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How many times do you think you've traveled with Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: Just the once, to Las Vegas.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you referred to Chicago at one point in your testimony.
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you go to Chicago?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what was the purpose for that trip?
Joy Robson: Wade was dancing on the music video “Jam”.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And was that a music video involving Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And was Mr. Jackson in Chicago with you?
Joy Robson: Not with us. He was there.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And what do you mean by “not with us”?
Joy Robson: Well, we weren't staying with him. We were flown in as Wade was working. And we stayed at a hotel. He did the job, and we returned to Los Angeles.
Mr. Mesereau: And to your knowledge, where did Mr. Jackson stay on that trip?
Joy Robson: I have no idea.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see Mr. Jackson on that trip?
Joy Robson: On the set, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see him in any other location?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know approximately when that was?
Joy Robson: I'm not sure. I want to say '92. Maybe in the middle of '92 somewhere.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. The prosecutor asked you some questions about whether you were concerned about manipulation. Remember that?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you ever concerned about Mr. Jackson manipulating you?
Joy Robson: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever tell anyone you were concerned that Mr. Jackson was manipulating Wade?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever tell anyone that you were concerned that Mr. Jackson was manipulating your daughter?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you use the word “manipulation”?
Joy Robson: Not to my knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: Are there any other entertainment-related transactions that you recall either you or your son being involved in with Michael Jackson?
Joy Robson: And what do you mean by “entertainment transactions”?
Mr. Mesereau: Any type of entertainment, transaction, project. You name it.
Joy Robson: He did three music videos. He did a Pepsi commercial. And the original L.A. Gear photo shoot. I think those are the only things he's ever done with Michael.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. Jackson, to your knowledge, help Wade with those projects?
Joy Robson: What do you mean by “help”?
Mr. Mesereau: Any kind of assistance.
Joy Robson: I mean, he offered -- he decided that he wanted -- he would want Wade to work on it, because he was the best person for the job. Other than that, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And to your knowledge, when is the last time Wade worked with Mr. Jackson on any entertainment-related project?
Joy Robson: The last thing he -- Michael performed with 'N Sync I think on an MTV Music Awards, and Wade was choreographing and directing it. He put that together.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately when that was?
Joy Robson: I want to say 2000, something like that.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you said that many times you went to Neverland and Mr. Jackson wasn't there, right?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you did that, how would you arrange to visit Neverland?
Joy Robson: Through his office. Through Evvy.
Mr. Mesereau: Had Mr. Jackson given you permission to visit Neverland when he wasn't there?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And approximately when did he say you could do that?
Joy Robson: He's always said that, that we're welcome any time.
Mr. Mesereau: And I believe you testified that you were there more times when he wasn't there than when he was there; is that right?
Joy Robson: Absolutely, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think you visited Neverland when Mr. Jackson wasn't even there?
Joy Robson: Maybe 40, 50 times.
Mr. Mesereau: And where would you stay when Mr. Jackson wasn't at Neverland?
Mr. Sneddon: Object as immaterial, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Joy Robson: Before he had the children, I would stay in the house. But since he's had the children and they're now the children's bedrooms, we stay in the guest units.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think you stayed in Mr. Jackson's main house before Mr. Jackson had his own children?
Joy Robson: Maybe 15, 20 times. I'm not sure.
Mr. Mesereau: And where would you typically stay?
Joy Robson: In the rose bedroom.
Mr. Mesereau: Please describe to the jury what the rose bedroom is.
Joy Robson: Its a large-sized bedroom with an adjoining bathroom. Hardwood floors. Beautiful wood -- carved wooden ceilings. Overlooks the front of the house. It's on the second floor.
Mr. Mesereau: And how far away is the rose bedroom from Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Joy Robson: Mr. Jackson's bedroom is on the ground floor. I don't know how to describe how far away. It's probably the length of two rooms, but on another floor.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, do you recall freely walking in and out of Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you say “bedroom”, you're talking about these two levels?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did Mr. Jackson ever put any restrictions on your walking in and out of his own room?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And you freely walked in and out of his own room?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you questions about a lock and alarm. Do you remember that?
Joy Robson: No. Oh, the chimes, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recollect your always having to go through a locked door to get into his room?
Joy Robson: I mean, I would always knock first before I went anyway, so I don't have any idea whether the door was locked or not. But I would never just walk in. I would always knock and someone would open the door.
Mr. Mesereau: What typically would happen when you'd knock?
Joy Robson: Wade would answer the door, or Michael.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And would someone open the door for you?
Joy Robson: Do you mean --
Mr. Mesereau: When you knocked and someone responded, would they typically open the door for you or would you open the door yourself?
Joy Robson: I think someone would open it for me.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you go into Mr. Jackson's room at all hours of the day?
Joy Robson: At any time I wanted to, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall being in his room during the day?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall being in his room during the evening?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall being in Mr. Jackson's room late at night?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever get the feeling that somebody was trying to keep you out of Mr. Jackson's room?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall spending much time in Mr. Jackson's room at Neverland?
Joy Robson: I have spent time in there on occasion watching television with them, but not often.
Mr. Mesereau: Where would you typically watch television when you were in Mr. Jackson's room?
Joy Robson: On the bed.
Mr. Mesereau: Would that be the bed on the second level?
Joy Robson: No. On the ground level.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, the issue of Mr. Jackson helping you with an automobile, when did that happen?
Joy Robson: I think maybe '93. Early '93.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you go to him and ask for some assistance in getting an automobile?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And what was his response?
Joy Robson: Well, I had asked him to co-sign. I wasn't asking for money. I was just asking for a signature. And his response was, “Well, why don't I just pay for it”.
Mr. Mesereau: And did he do that, to your knowledge?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you feel that he was doing that because he wanted something in return in any way?
Joy Robson: Not at all.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you feel there was any quid pro quo when he helped you with the car?
Joy Robson: Absolutely not.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you feel there was any quid pro quo when he helped you with money?
Joy Robson: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you feel there was any quid pro quo when he helped you as a sponsor?
Joy Robson: Not at all.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, what was this issue -- you needed him as a sponsor for what purpose?
Joy Robson: To remain in the United States. We -- permanent residence. To be able to have a green card, we had to have someone sponsor us into the country.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you go to him and ask him if he would be your sponsor?
Joy Robson: I talked to him about it, and he said he would do whatever he could to do. He just instructed his office to do whatever was needed.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, what was done to help you?
Joy Robson: An offer -- they put me on their books as an employee of the company.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. Jackson have to actually sign anything to be your sponsor, if you recall?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you ask him to do that?
Joy Robson: Yes. Pretty much. Basically I asked for help. So that was the only way we could stay, so, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And he did help you, right?
Joy Robson: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you feel like you owed him anything after he helped sponsor your family to stay in the U.S.?
Joy Robson: No. Not at all.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you received some payment through Michael Jackson Productions; is that right?
Joy Robson: My earnings from the cosmetic company was diverted through the company, through his company, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: What cosmetics company was that?
Joy Robson: Pigments. P-i-g-m-e-n-t-s.
Mr. Mesereau: Where is that company located?
Joy Robson: On Burton Way in Beverly Hills.
Mr. Mesereau: And you actually were working there?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you begin working at that cosmetics company?
Joy Robson: I think '93. '92 or '93.
Mr. Mesereau: And the idea was that because you weren't a resident, you were not supposed to be employed; is that the idea?
Joy Robson: I was on a working visa, but it was through MJJ Productions. I was -- I was employed to be employed by MJJ Productions only. So I managed to find this job for myself. And in order to make it legal, it had to be diverted through MJJ Productions.
Mr. Mesereau: And where were you living at the time?
Joy Robson: I was living in Hollywood.
Mr. Mesereau: And who else was living there with you?
Joy Robson: Chantal and Wade.
Mr. Mesereau: And were you the main person providing for your family at that point?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You needed a job, didn't you?
Joy Robson: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Jackson helped you get a job, correct?
Joy Robson: Well, he helped me, yeah. I mean, he didn't get the job for me. I got the job, but he made it possible for me to be allowed to do that, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And how long did that arrangement last?
Joy Robson: Oh, I think three years.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So for approximately three years you were paid through MJJ Productions, right?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Michael's Jackson's company?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you the primary wage earner for your family at that point?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And why did that arrangement end?
Joy Robson: Wade booked a feature film. He was working as an actor on a feature film. And because he was a minor, I had to be there with him. So I left the job and worked with him on the film.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did Mr. Jackson ever ask anything in return for what he had done for you during those three years?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever feel you had to repay him for any of that?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you spoke to Mr. Sneddon before today, did you not?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were actually questioned by Mr. Sneddon before today, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When were you questioned by Mr. Sneddon?
Joy Robson: Before the grand jury, I think in '93 or '94.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that the only time?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you recall Mr. Sneddon trying to get you to agree that your son had been kidnapped by Michael Jackson?
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to object. Argumentative; hearsay; and irrelevant.
Mr. Sneddon: It's my objection.
Mr. Zonen: Oh.
Mr. Sneddon: Let me do it this way. I object. Same basis.
The Court: I'll sustain both of you.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge -- all right. To your knowledge, has your son ever been held against his will by Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, has your son ever been kidnapped by Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, has your son ever been abused by Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, object. Leading; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you questions about seeing June Chandler at Neverland. Do you remember that?
Joy Robson: I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see her at Neverland?
Joy Robson: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you talk to her at Neverland?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was she a friend of yours?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't care for her, right?
Joy Robson: I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Why?
Joy Robson: My impression of June Chandler was that she wanted to be mistress of Neverland; that she was ordering the staff around as if she owned Neverland; that she wanted everything that went with it. My impression of June Chandler was that she was a gold-digger.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see her interact with Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you feel she was trying to use Mr. Jackson?
Joy Robson: Absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever talk to Mr. Jackson about it?
Joy Robson: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you about someone named Blanca Francia.
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know Blanca Francia?
Joy Robson: I don't know her. I remember her working there.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever chat with her?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember seeing Blanca Francia in Mr. Jackson's room?
Joy Robson: I remember seeing her go in there to clean. I don't remember seeing her in there.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall being at Neverland when large numbers of children would visit?
Joy Robson: Yes. Once.
Mr. Mesereau: And when was that?
Joy Robson: I don't remember when it was. It was -- I'm trying to work out about what age Wade would have been. It's probably around '99, 2000. There was a group of children there from the -- the Wish Foundation or Create-a-Wish Foundation.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you spend time with those children?
Joy Robson: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you do with those children?
Joy Robson: We played with them on the -- in the amusement park.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, beyond the scope of cross.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions, Your Honor.
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SNEDDON:
Mr. Sneddon: Miss Robson, you're not jealous of June Chandler, are you, because she displaced you?
Joy Robson: Not at all.
Mr. Sneddon: Not at all?
Joy Robson: Not at all.
Mr. Sneddon: That wasn't the feeling you had at the ranch, because she was in control?
Joy Robson: Absolutely not.
Mr. Sneddon: And her son had replaced your son?
Joy Robson: My son was there.
Mr. Sneddon: Yes, but he wasn't in the bedroom with Michael Jackson anymore, was he?
Joy Robson: I don't know that he wanted to be. He was Michael's friend. They were there together as friends. I had no wish to be June Chandler.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, I didn't ask you whether you wished to be June Chandler. I asked you whether you were jealous of her position.
Joy Robson: Certainly not. What position would that be?
Mr. Sneddon: Of being able to be close to Michael Jackson at that point in time.
Joy Robson: I don't think she was close to Michael Jackson at that time.
Mr. Sneddon: You don't?
Joy Robson: No. As a matter of fact, Michael spent a good deal --
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. She hasn't completed her answer, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled. Next question.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know how many trips they went on together?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know how long they spent with each other?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: You have no idea, do you?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: So you don't have any idea how close she was to Mr. Jackson at that point in time, no personal knowledge?
Joy Robson: My personal knowledge from that weekend was when I saw Michael Jackson trying to elude June Chandler for the entire weekend.
Mr. Sneddon: Move to strike as nonresponsive, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Sneddon: And you said that the defendant, Mr. Jackson here, was the person who easily created trust in people; is that right?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And in relationship to you and your family, he created that trust very easily and very quickly, correct?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: You saw him do that with other people, too, correct?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: You didn't?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: You were the only ones that you observed him to be trust --
Joy Robson: The only time I was ever around anybody else with Michael would have been on the set in Chicago with the Barnes family and that one weekend with the Chandler family.
Mr. Sneddon: So your opinion about Mr. Jackson and his ability to form trust quickly and easily has to do simply with your family?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did I understand you correctly that you stated that when you came to the country, your visa only allowed you to work for MJJ Productions?
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, Mr. Mesereau asked you questions about were you aware of what was going on in the evening in Mr. Jackson's room. Do you recall that?
Joy Robson: He asked me if I'd been into the room.
Mr. Sneddon: In the evening.
Joy Robson: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you have no idea, once you left that room, what went on inside that bedroom, do you, of personal knowledge?
Joy Robson: Only what my son tells me.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, you don't know whether they were playing video games, correct?
Joy Robson: If my son tells me they were, they were.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. I think I asked you of personal knowledge.
Joy Robson: That is personal knowledge from my son telling me. I believe him.
Mr. Sneddon: Something you saw with your own eyes or heard with your own ears, not from your son. Do you have any personal knowledge what went on behind those closed doors in that bedroom?
Joy Robson: Not on every occasion. I was not there on every occasion, no.
Mr. Sneddon: For instance, have you talked to Mr. Mesereau since the testimony yesterday?
Joy Robson: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you talk to him at all in preparation for your testimony?
Joy Robson: We had a brief conversation about how things would be in the courtroom, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And did -- are you aware of the fact that at the time of the execution of the search warrant in this case at Neverland Valley Ranch, that there was a whole assortment of sexually explicit magazines and books that were found in Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Relevance; beyond the scope.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: You told Mr. Mesereau in response to his questions that you came to the country without any promises from Mr. Jackson; is that what you said?
Joy Robson: That's my memory.
Mr. Sneddon: That's not what you told the grand jury back in 1994, was it?
Joy Robson: Well, I read something different. I don't remember that.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, that was you testifying, wasn't it?
Joy Robson: Well, I'm saying I don't remember it now. Apparently that's what I testified to.
Mr. Sneddon: Under oath?
Joy Robson: Verbal -- maybe they were verbal. What I'm saying is there were no contracts. There may have been something verbal.
Mr. Sneddon: It didn't say that in your testimony, did it? It said, “Mr. Jackson had arranged the following”?
Joy Robson: Well, that's incorrect.
Mr. Sneddon: But you said it?
Joy Robson: Well, I'm sorry. I made a mistake back then. There was never anything verbal, never any contracts.
Mr. Sneddon: You remember better today than you did back then?
Joy Robson: Apparently.
Mr. Sneddon: No further questions.
Message: FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: In response to the prosecutor's questions, you said you believe your son?
Joy Robson: Absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: Why do you believe what your son told you?
Joy Robson: We just have a very close relationship.
Mr. Sneddon: Excuse me, I didn't ask any questions about believing her son. It's beyond the scope of examination.
The Court: I don't think it's beyond the scope. But it's an improper question. I'll sustain the objection.
Mr. Mesereau: Could you clarify this issue of something being arranged when you came to the United States; what was arranged, what wasn't arranged?
Joy Robson: Well, there were no contracts. I honestly don't know what I was referring to in the grand jury. Perhaps -- from my memory -- I mean, we're going back 12, 13 years. From my memory, I remember Michael saying that he would help in whatever way he could. That he had movie companies. He had, you know, record companies. If there's something he could do, he would help. But there were certainly no arrangements. We came here and -- I mean, I had to get a job to work. There was no -- there were no contracts. There was nothing arranged. I didn't come here expecting Michael Jackson to give Wade a career.
Mr. Mesereau: Has Mr. Jackson always been available to help your family when you needed some assistance?
Mr. Sneddon: Object, Your Honor. Beyond the scope and leading.
Mr. Mesereau: I don't think so, Your Honor. He talked about arrangements.
The Court: You may answer.
Joy Robson: Michael's a friend. And like any friend, if we needed anything, he would be there, and -- and vice versa. We were there for each other as friends are.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions.
Mr. Sneddon: No questions.
The Court: All right. Thank you. You're not being excused. There's an issue about some other questions that I'm going to take up, so you may be called back.
Joy Robson: All right.
The Court: For now, you may leave.
Joy Robson: Thank you.
The Court: Call your next witness.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Defense will call Lisbeth Barnes, Your Honor. May I take a second? She's not right here, so we will call Chantal Robson, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. When you get to the witness stand, please remain standing. Face the clerk here and raise your right hand.
Message: CHANTAL ROBSON Having been sworn, testified as follows:
Chantal Robson: I do.
The Clerk: Please be seated. State and spell your name for the record.

Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:
Mr. Auchincloss: Good morning, Miss Robson.
Chantal Robson: Good morning.
Mr. Auchincloss: You first met Mr. Jackson in 1990; is that correct?
Chantal Robson: '89.
Mr. Auchincloss: '89. All right. And that was in Australia?
Chantal Robson: No. That was in America.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. So the first time you met Mr. Jackson was the time -- the first time that you visited Neverland Ranch?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Neverland Ranch seem to you to be an awe-inspiring place when you first visited it?
Chantal Robson: I'm sorry, an awe --
Mr. Auchincloss: Awe-inspiring.
Chantal Robson: Yes. It's a beautiful place.
Mr. Auchincloss: Very impressive?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you impressed with meeting Mr. Jackson the first time you met him?
Chantal Robson: Not really impressed. I was young, so the idea of the fact that he was being famous really didn't mean anything.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. It didn't strike you as anything remarkable to meet a superstar at that time when you were ten years old?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Had you ever listened to his music?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have any of his albums?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And then after your first visit to Neverland, you returned to Australia?
Chantal Robson: Uh-huh.
Mr. Auchincloss: With your family?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And your brother Wade?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did Wade communicate with Mr. Jackson during that period of time?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he call him?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. Jackson call Wade?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would this be a frequent occurrence?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And would they talk on the phone for hours?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Weekly?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: More than once in a week?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: During that period of time, did your brother seem to be fascinated with his relationship with this star?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Chantal Robson: He was fascinated with the friendship.
Mr. Auchincloss: It was something very important to him, wasn't it?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did they send faxes back and forth?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: How often would they do that?
Chantal Robson: I don't remember. It wasn't as often as the phone calls.
Mr. Auchincloss: But this was a very special bond that Wade had with Michael Jackson, wasn't it?
Chantal Robson: Like any other friend, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: But this was a special friend, wasn't it?
Chantal Robson: I don't know what you mean by “special”.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, did Wade have anybody else that he had a relationship with that you could compare to his relationship with Mr. Jackson?
Chantal Robson: Me.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. But let me paraphrase -- or let me rephrase that. Any relationship with an adult like he had with Mr. Jackson, an adult who's not a member of his family?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: And your first night at Neverland you stated that you slept in Mr. Jackson's bed?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Bedroom?
Chantal Robson: The second night. The first time I was in the room.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. So the very first night that you went to Neverland you spent the night in Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Chantal Robson: In his bedroom, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And on that first night, you slept downstairs in the bedroom, correct?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: You slept upstairs?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you -- or I'll rephrase that. Were you interviewed by Scott Ross, an investigator for Mr. Jackson, on May 2nd, 2005?
Chantal Robson: Yes. Not quite sure if that was the date, but, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: That was just a few days ago?
Chantal Robson: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you tell Mr. Ross that you recalled the first night that you slept downstairs, and Wade went upstairs and slept with Mr. Jackson?
Chantal Robson: No. It would be the other way around.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Chantal Robson: Michael and Wade slept -- Michael and Wade slept downstairs and I slept upstairs on the first night.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. So Mr. Jackson and Wade slept together separately from the area that you slept in?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why was that?
Chantal Robson: Because I left and went upstairs.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why did you leave and go upstairs?
Chantal Robson: Because I was a little older at that point and I felt like I was interfering in Michael's bedroom, so I left and went upstairs.
Mr. Auchincloss: Because you wanted to give Mr. Jackson some privacy?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And he was alone with your brother at that time?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And your brother was seven years old?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And that night, your brother slept in the same bed with Michael Jackson?
Chantal Robson: Yes. I told him to come up with me.
Mr. Auchincloss: You told him to come up with you?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was that because you felt like he shouldn't be sleeping in a bed with a grown man?
Chantal Robson: Not at all.
Mr. Auchincloss: Then why did you tell him to do that?
Chantal Robson: Because I didn't want to make Michael feel like two people were invading his space.
Mr. Auchincloss: Something about that first night made you feel uncomfortable, didn't it?
Chantal Robson: No, not at all.
Mr. Auchincloss: Didn't you say you felt more comfortable the second night to Mr. Ross when you spoke to him a few days ago?
Chantal Robson: Comfortable with my friendship with Michael, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And that next night, you slept in the same bed with Michael Jackson?
Chantal Robson: I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: And your mother knew about it?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: He was 35 years old?
Chantal Robson: Yep.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you were ten?
Chantal Robson: Yep.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was that the first time you'd ever done anything like that?
Chantal Robson: Done anything like what?
Mr. Auchincloss: As a young girl, sleeping with a grown man who's unrelated to you, that you just met.
Chantal Robson: That was the first time I'd ever done that. It's not the first time I've ever slept with somebody over 35.
Mr. Auchincloss: As a ten-year-old, did you sleep with someone over 35, other than Michael Jackson?
Chantal Robson: I've slept with my dad.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm talking about an unrelated person.
Chantal Robson: No, that was the first time.
Mr. Auchincloss: As a child, how many unrelated men did you sleep with that were over the age of 30?
Chantal Robson: None.
Mr. Auchincloss: Just Mr. Jackson?
Chantal Robson: Other than my father, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Whose idea was it that you sleep in Mr. Jackson's bed?
Chantal Robson: It was actually our idea.
Mr. Auchincloss: Sorry?
Chantal Robson: My brother and I. It was actually not an idea. We just fell asleep.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. Jackson discourage this? Did he say in any way that this is not appropriate for two small children to be sleeping in the bed with a 35-year-old unrelated man?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: And as you sit here today, as an adult, you think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old girl to sleep in the same bed with an unrelated 35-year-old man that she's just met?
Chantal Robson: I think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old girl to sleep in a bed with a friend.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. What about a 35-year-old man that she has just met. That's my question. Do you think that's appropriate?
Chantal Robson: If she feels comfortable that he is a friend.
Mr. Auchincloss: If the ten-year-old thinks it's okay, she should do it?
Chantal Robson: And the parents. Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: Something you would allow?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What about a seven-year-old boy?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: You would allow your own seven-year-old son to sleep with a 35-year-old man that he has just met?
Chantal Robson: If I trusted the man, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you think that type of trust can be earned in one day?
Chantal Robson: I don't think trust is always earned.
Mr. Auchincloss: How do you gain trust, other than earning it?
Chantal Robson: I think it's a feeling. It's a friend.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Jackson's pretty good at that, isn't he, at gaining trust?
Chantal Robson: I don't understand how you could say somebody's good at gaining trust.
Mr. Auchincloss: He makes you feel very comfortable when you first meet him; isn't that true?
Chantal Robson: I think it depends on who's meeting him.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, you felt very comfortable, true, the very first day?
Chantal Robson: Well, I was his friend.
Mr. Auchincloss: And your mother felt very comfortable the very first day, true?
Chantal Robson: My mother had already met him two years prior.
Mr. Auchincloss: But she just met him as an acquaintance. You know that, right?
Chantal Robson: They spent a lot of time together before that, though.
Mr. Auchincloss: They had spent what?
Chantal Robson: They spent time together before that.
Mr. Auchincloss: On how many occasions?
Chantal Robson: Just the once when they were in Australia. But she actually spent hours and had conversation and got to know Michael, so she had a relationship prior.
Mr. Auchincloss: So your testimony is that your mother knew you were going to be sleeping in the same bed with Michael Jackson that night?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Michael Jackson ever refer to you as a member of his family?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he ever refer to Wade as a member of his family?
Chantal Robson: Not to my knowledge, no.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are you aware that there are other boys that have spent the night in Michael Jackson's bed?
Chantal Robson: I am.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know their names?
Chantal Robson: Some of them.
Mr. Auchincloss: Which ones do you know?
Chantal Robson: Jordie Chandler, Macaulay Culkin and Brett Barnes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Jackson has been very generous to you, hasn't he?
Chantal Robson: It depends on what you mean by “generous”.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, he's allowed you the run of his ranch anytime you wanted, true?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And he picks up the tab, correct?
Chantal Robson: The tab at his house. It's like me going to any other friend's house and spending time there.
Mr. Auchincloss: Neverland's not like any other friend's house, is it?
Chantal Robson: No, but I have a lot of friends that have beautiful homes. And when I go there, they allow me to eat for free.
Mr. Auchincloss: And Mr. Jackson has given your mother loans in the past?
Chantal Robson: Loans?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And at Neverland, you pretty much have -- get to do whatever you please as a child?
Chantal Robson: Well, I don't know about “whatever you please”. I mean, you're protected. You can't --
Mr. Auchincloss: Within the bounds of safety.
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: You pretty much have the run of the ranch, true?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Get to stay up late?
Chantal Robson: Yep.
Mr. Auchincloss: Eat all the candy you want?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: There are really no rules, are there, except for your safety?
Chantal Robson: Depending on whether your mother has certain rules for you or --
Mr. Auchincloss: But when you're away from your parents and when you're with Mr. Jackson, you get to do whatever you want?
Chantal Robson: Well --
Mr. Auchincloss: Pretty much, true?
Chantal Robson: As long as they're not what your mother's told you not to do.
Mr. Auchincloss: All of these families that you've mentioned spend time with Mr. Jackson, right, the boys of families?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And all of these families have one thing in common, don't they? They all have boys?
Chantal Robson: And sisters.
Mr. Auchincloss: Right. But each one has boys?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And each one of those families has a boy that forms a special relationship with Mr. Jackson; isn't that true?
Chantal Robson: Your idea of special relationship, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, Mr. Jackson had a relationship with Wade that was far closer than the relationship that you had with Mr. Jackson, true?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And Mr. Jackson chose Wade to sleep in his bedroom night after night after night?
Chantal Robson: I don't think Michael Jackson chose Wade to sleep in his bedroom.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, he allowed it, true?
Chantal Robson: There's a difference between allowing and choosing.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, you don't really know what he chose, do you?
Chantal Robson: I think that we had the ability to leave.
Mr. Auchincloss: That's a “yes” or “no” question. Do you know what Mr. Jackson was choosing when he and Wade were sleeping in the same bed together?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Ever heard of the “Apple Head Club”?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Never?
Chantal Robson: Apple Head Club? No.
Mr. Auchincloss: How about the “Doo-Doo-Head Club”?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you ever heard those expressions?
Chantal Robson: Yes. Not “Club”.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Wade an “Apple Head”?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know how many times Wade slept with Mr. Jackson alone in his bed?
Chantal Robson: I do not.
Mr. Auchincloss: And Miss Robson, you really have no idea what happened between Mr. Jackson and Wade on those many nights that they slept alone behind closed doors in Mr. Jackson's bedroom, do you?
Chantal Robson: Yes, I do.
Mr. Auchincloss: You weren't there, though, were you?
Chantal Robson: It doesn't matter.
Mr. Auchincloss: You're just judging that based upon what Wade told you?
Chantal Robson: Based upon what my brother tells me and my friends tell me, yes. But just like anything, we base a lot on what people tell us.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would it surprise you to learn that there has been an expert who testified in this case that up to 50 percent of all children --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection to the question.
Mr. Auchincloss: I haven't finished the question.
Mr. Mesereau: Referring to other testimony.
Mr. Auchincloss: Based to challenge her credibility.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you think all child molest victims divulge, as children, that they've been molested?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence; beyond the scope; improper opinion.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you think that?
Chantal Robson: Can you repeat the question, please?
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you think that all child molest victims divulge the fact that they've been molested when they are children?
Chantal Robson: I honestly have no idea. I haven't studied up on all the requirements of a child molester.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you have an impression of the type of shame that would be associated for a child to admit that he's been molested?
Chantal Robson: Again, I don't really know what goes through somebody's mind.
Mr. Auchincloss: There would be a great deal of guilt associated with a family, parents, that allowed their child to sleep with Michael Jackson or an adult, any adult, if they found out that that child had been molested by that person, wouldn't there?
Chantal Robson: I don't think there would necessarily be guilt. I think there would be anger and they would do whatever they could to have that person not around.
Mr. Auchincloss: It would upset them, though. It would be disturbing, wouldn't it?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: That's a feeling they'd like to avoid, wouldn't it?
Chantal Robson: No, I think it's a feeling that they would want to solve.
Mr. Auchincloss: But if they chose to deny that feeling, you could understand why, couldn't you?
Chantal Robson: I don't know. I've never been put in that position.
Mr. Auchincloss: I have no further questions.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Miss Robson, if you thought your brother had been molested by Michael Jackson, would you go to a lawyer first to seek money?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Requires speculation; argument.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you questions about whether or not you believed your brother Wade felt his friendship with Michael Jackson was important. Do you remember that question?
Chantal Robson: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said you thought so, right?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Why do you think so?
Chantal Robson: Because I think that anybody that gains a friendship with anyone thinks that that relationship is important, otherwise they would not be friends with that person.
Mr. Mesereau: And was it your belief that your brother had a good friendship with Michael Jackson?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see a problem with that?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you about a special bond between Wade and Michael Jackson. Remember that question?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you think he had a special bond with Michael Jackson?
Chantal Robson: I think like any other friend.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you think you have a special bond with Michael Jackson?
Chantal Robson: I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Why?
Chantal Robson: Because he is my friend and I love him.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you think Mr. Jackson has a special bond with your mom?
Chantal Robson: I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Why do you think that?
Chantal Robson: Same reason. We're friends, and we're there for each other.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you about whether or not you were comfortable with the fact that children have slept in Mr. Jackson's room. Remember that?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you comfortable with that?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Why?
Chantal Robson: Because I trust Michael Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Why?
Chantal Robson: Because it's a feeling that I have. He's a friend, and he's never, ever made me feel like I shouldn't trust him.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you questions about the words “Apple Head” and “Doo-Doo Head”, right?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you heard those words before?
Chantal Robson: Yes, I have.
Mr. Mesereau: Let's start with “Apple Head”. Where have you heard the word “Apple Head”?
Chantal Robson: Michael has called me and my brother “Apple Head”.
Mr. Mesereau: Where have you heard the word “Doo-Doo Head”?
Chantal Robson: Michael has called me or my brother “Doo-Doo Head”.
Mr. Mesereau: When Michael Jackson called you “Apple Head”, did you ever get suspicious that some crime was occurring?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When Michael Jackson called you “Doo-Doo Head”, were you ever suspicious that there was some sexual reason for that?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When Michael Jackson called your brother “Apple Head”, did you ever suspect some abusive type of thing was going on?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; leading.
Mr. Mesereau: I think he opened that, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: Same objection.
The Court: The answer was, “No”. Next question.
Mr. Mesereau: When Mr. Jackson called your brother “Doo-Doo Head”, did you ever suspect something nefarious was happening?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you questions about victims of child molestation, okay? Did you ever think your brother was the victim of a child molestation?
Chantal Robson: I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Why not?
Chantal Robson: Because he would have told me.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he ever tell you that he had been improperly touched?
Chantal Robson: No, he did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Did your brother ever tell you that he had been molested?
Chantal Robson: No.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, did your brother ever tell you, “I have never been molested by Michael Jackson”?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Isn't it true you don't think for one second that Mr. Jackson ever abused your brother?
Chantal Robson: That is true.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't think for one second that Mr. Jackson ever molested your brother, do you?
Chantal Robson: That is true.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't think for one second Mr. Jackson ever touched your brother in a sexual way, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Chantal Robson: I do not think for one second.
Mr. Mesereau: Why not?
Chantal Robson: Because --
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Prosecutor Auchincloss asked you questions about a family feeling guilty for allowing molestation to occur. Do you feel guilty about anything involving your relationship with Michael Jackson?
Chantal Robson: I do not.
Mr. Mesereau: Why not?
Chantal Robson: I have no reason to feel guilty. It's a normal friendship.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, does your brother feel guilty about anything involving his relationship with Michael Jackson?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Speculation; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you discussed with your brother the prosecutor's allegations that Michael Jackson improperly touched him?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had many discussions with him?
Chantal Robson: A couple.
Mr. Mesereau: Your brother's pretty upset with these allegations, isn't he?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Hearsay; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Chantal Robson: Yes, he is.
Mr. Mesereau: Why?
Chantal Robson: Because they're not true.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you upset with these allegations?
Chantal Robson: I am.
Mr. Mesereau: Why?
Chantal Robson: Because they're not true. And a friend of mine is being accused of something that's not true.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever felt guilty about having a friendship with Michael Jackson?
Chantal Robson: I have not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: The answer is in. Next question.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you feel guilty about ever staying in Michael's room?
Chantal Robson: I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you feel guilty about ever visiting Michael's room?
Chantal Robson: I do not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. The answer was given.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever get the feeling Michael Jackson was trying to talk you into being in his room?
Chantal Robson: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever get the feeling Michael Jackson was trying to talk your brother into being in his room?
Chantal Robson: Never.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; leading.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions.
The Court: Overruled.
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:
Mr. Auchincloss: You said that you trusted Michael Jackson?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would you trust him never to give alcohol to a child?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would you trust him never to show pornography -- well, excuse me, erotic -- adult erotic materials to a child?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would you trust him not to keep those things laying around his bedroom when he has children in that room?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence; improper question.
Mr. Auchincloss: There's evidence that he had --
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Chantal Robson: Can you please repeat your question?
Mr. Auchincloss: Would you trust him not to have adult erotic materials sitting around his room when he had children in his room?
Chantal Robson: I don't know if that's a trust issue.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, would you like him -- would you trust him enough to think that he'd keep those materials separate from children?
Chantal Robson: It would be nice. But I also understand it's somebody's house and sometimes things are lying around.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would you trust him enough to -- would you trust him not to have statues, figurines of nude women in bondage attire sitting around on a desk where he has his own children visiting him?
Chantal Robson: I don't know if he's ever had that, so --
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm asking you, would you trust him not to do that?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: So if he did any of these things, he would be violating your trust, wouldn't he? You'd have to evaluate your level of trust, wouldn't you?
Chantal Robson: No, I don't think it would violate my trust.
Mr. Auchincloss: If he showed -- if he showed erotic -- adult erotic materials to a child that he's been giving alcohol to, wouldn't you have to reevaluate whether you trust this man or not?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; argumentative.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Chantal Robson: Repeat the question, please.
Mr. Auchincloss: My question is, if Mr. Jackson showed adult erotic material to a child that he'd been giving alcohol to, you'd have to reevaluate whether you really trust this man or not, wouldn't you?
Chantal Robson: If Michael Jackson did do that, yes, you would have to reevaluate.
Mr. Auchincloss: So you wouldn't trust him if he did that?
Chantal Robson: If he did that, yes. But I don't believe he did it, so....
Mr. Auchincloss: I have no further questions.
Message: FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: You've heard about the allegations in this case, right?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You've discussed them with your family, right?
Chantal Robson: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't believe Michael Jackson ever molested the Arvizo children, do you?
Chantal Robson: I --
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. That calls for a conclusion; impermissible question.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you trust that Michael Jackson never molested any alleged victim in this case?
Mr. Auchincloss: Same objection.
Mr. Mesereau: He raised the issue of trust, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: It is -- well --
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you trust Michael Jackson?
Chantal Robson: I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Why do you trust Michael Jackson?
Chantal Robson: Because he is my friend.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Asked and answered; beyond the scope.
The Court: Overruled. You can complete your answer if you didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me withdraw the question.
The Court: She answered it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: But I'm not sure she wasn't cut off in the middle.
Chantal Robson: That's okay. He's my friend.
Mr. Mesereau: Are there any other reasons why you trust Michael Jackson?
Chantal Robson: He has never, ever given me any reason not to trust him.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you think he's honest?
Chantal Robson: I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you think he's a sensitive man?
Chantal Robson: I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you think Mr. Jackson would ever, ever harm a child?
Chantal Robson: I don't, no.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you trust --
The Court: Wait a minute. I'll strike the answer.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you trust that Mr. Jackson would --
Mr. Auchincloss: Your Honor, I'm going to object. I'm going --
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, the prosecutor asked her all these questions about her trust in Mr. Jackson. I'm just --
The Court: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm just examining on those issues.
The Court: You may on some issues. And some you may not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: So take it one question at a time.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you trust that Mr. Jackson would never give alcohol to a cancer patient so he could commit the crime of molestation?
Chantal Robson: I do.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; leading. Also calls for an ultimate issue, ultimate conclusion.
The Court: I'll sustain the objection.
Mr. Mesereau: Please tell the jury every reason why you trust Michael Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer that.
Chantal Robson: He has been my friend for many years. He has cared for me like an older brother and a father. There has never been one time in my life where he has ever turned his back on my family. Vice versa. My family has never turned our back on him. We love him. It's hard to explain. When you have a friendship with someone and you know that it's a true person and it's a friend --
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm going to object as a narrative.
The Court: Overruled. Were you through with your statement?
Chantal Robson: It's just that he's a true person and he's a friend, and I trust him always.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions.
Message: FURTHER RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:

Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Good morning, Miss Barnes.
Lisbeth Barnes: Good morning.
Mr. Mesereau: Where is your home?
Lisbeth Barnes: In Melbourne, Australia.
Mr. Mesereau: And you have a son, right?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, I do. And a daughter.
Mr. Mesereau: And what is your son's name?
Lisbeth Barnes: Brett.
Mr. Mesereau: And your daughter's name?
Lisbeth Barnes: Karlee.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know the person seated at counsel table to my right?
Lisbeth Barnes: I do.
Mr. Mesereau: And who is he?
Lisbeth Barnes: Michael Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you first meet him?
Lisbeth Barnes: 19 -- December 1991.
Mr. Mesereau: And how did you meet him?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, actually, when I met him personally was in December of 1991, but I had spoken to him for several years prior to that. I -- he invited us to his home in December 1991, and that's when I met him for the first time.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you said you'd been speaking to him for a while before that?
Lisbeth Barnes: Since 1987.
Mr. Mesereau: And why were you speaking to him?
Lisbeth Barnes: Because he had called -- my son had written a letter to him when he was very young, when Michael was touring Australia. And he received the letter and he -- well, he pulled out a letter out of the bag, that's what he told me, and it was Brett's, and he decided that he'd call him to thank him for the letter. And he spoke to all of us, and we developed a friendship, and he continued calling us and speaking to us. And then one day he decided to invite us over to his home, and since then we've been regular visitors.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you still consider Mr. Jackson to be your friend?
Lisbeth Barnes: Oh, definitely.
Mr. Mesereau: Where are you staying at the moment?
Lisbeth Barnes: I'm staying at his -- at Neverland Valley, at his place.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think you have stayed over at Neverland?
Lisbeth Barnes: Several times. I can't count.
Mr. Mesereau: Can you give an estimate?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it be ten times?
Lisbeth Barnes: Could be. Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Could it be 20?
Lisbeth Barnes: No, maybe not 20. Probably about ten, I guess, or a little bit more, a little bit less. I'm not sure. I'm -- I know it's several times. I can take time and count back, but I haven't thought about it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And your first visit to Neverland was when, what year, if you know?
Lisbeth Barnes: December 1991.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And who did you visit Neverland with?
Lisbeth Barnes: Our family. My husband, my two children.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And how long did you stay there?
Lisbeth Barnes: About three weeks. Well, we stayed with Michael for that three weeks. He took us to Disneyland, to Las Vegas, and, yes, we were together for three weeks.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And where did you stay during those three weeks?
Lisbeth Barnes: Sometimes at Neverland Valley. Sometimes at Disneyland, and Las Vegas, depending on the places we were visiting. And sometimes at the hotel in Los Angeles.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, let me direct you to the first time -- first night you were at Neverland, okay?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you do?
Lisbeth Barnes: We -- he took us on a tour of the place, and we -- pretty much that. And then we watched a film at the theater, had dinner, sat down and talked, and pretty much that.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did you stay that evening?
Lisbeth Barnes: In one of the guesthouse -- guest units at the ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know where your children stayed that evening?
Lisbeth Barnes: Same -- well, one of the other units at the -- they're just a group of units, and they were in the next one.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, has your son ever stayed in Michael Jackson's room at Neverland?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, he has.
Mr. Mesereau: And when was the first time that happened?
Lisbeth Barnes: I couldn't tell you. I couldn't remember. I can't remember. I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, has your daughter ever been in Michael Jackson's room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, she has also.
Mr. Mesereau: And to your knowledge, has she ever stayed in his room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, she has.
Mr. Mesereau: And how about you, have you ever been in his room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, I have. And I have been invited to stay over because we were watching videos and talking, and he just suggested, “Well, why don't you stay; stay here”, because it was raining outside. And he said, “Well, you can stay here”. And I stayed for a little while, but then I went back to my room. It was just more comfortable.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think you've been in Michael Jackson's room at Neverland?
Lisbeth Barnes: Oh, several times.
Mr. Mesereau: Has it been all times of day?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes. I had pretty much free rein -- just anytime I wanted to, I was allowed to.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, let me ask you about that. You've been in Michael Jackson's room during the day, right?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: You've been there during the evening, right?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you been there late into the night?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, yes. Pretty much when we were watching videos, it would be -- go pretty well late into the night.
Mr. Mesereau: How often do you think you've watched videos late into the night in Michael Jackson's room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Several times.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Lisbeth Barnes: Or times we were just talking, or --
Mr. Mesereau: When you visited Neverland with your children, did you feel that you had free access to Michael Jackson's room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And why did you feel that way?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, he gave me free access. He -- he -- I remember a particular occasion when I wanted to borrow some CDs, and he said, “Just come into my room and” -- that is where they are kept and he showed me where the selection of CDs were kept, and he said, “Anytime you want to come and borrow the CDs, feel free to do so”.
Mr. Mesereau: And how would you describe Mr. Jackson's room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Just a huge room and -- with lots of things in it. Very, very warm and -- but nothing ostentatious. I don't know what sort of description you're looking for.
Mr. Mesereau: Is it two levels? Do you recall an upstairs and a downstairs in the room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you been into both parts of his room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall having to knock on a door to get into his room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, I do that normally when I go into -- doesn't matter whose place I go, it's just common courtesy to knock before you enter. But I could have just -- the door was never locked, so I could go in anytime I wanted to.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you ever denied access to his room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever go into the room when your children were in the room with him?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you done that often?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, what have you seen your children doing with Mr. Jackson in Mr. Jackson's room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Just talking, watching films, and listening to -- just reading stories or just having fun. Just chilling out, you know. Playing with games, toys, whatever.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever seen Mr. Jackson do anything inappropriate with either of your children?
Lisbeth Barnes: No. Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever seen Mr. Jackson inappropriately touch your son?
Lisbeth Barnes: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever seen Mr. Jackson inappropriately touch your daughter?
Lisbeth Barnes: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever seen Mr. Jackson hug your son?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever been suspicious of the fact that Mr. Jackson hugged your son?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever seen Mr. Jackson hug your daughter?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever been suspicious of Mr. Jackson hugging your daughter?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever seen Mr. Jackson kiss your son on the cheek?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Has that ever made you suspicious of Mr. Jackson?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever seen Mr. Jackson kiss your daughter on her cheek?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever been suspicious of that behavior?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you gave your son permission to stay in Mr. Jackson's room, correct?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you give your daughter permission to stay in his room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Why?
Lisbeth Barnes: Why not?
Mr. Mesereau: Did you trust Mr. Jackson?
Lisbeth Barnes: Implicitly. I always trusted him and I still trust him.
Mr. Mesereau: Why?
Lisbeth Barnes: Because he's just a very nice person. And you just feel when you can trust someone and when you can't trust someone. And I had total trust in him.
Mr. Mesereau: And your son traveled with him at some point, correct?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh. Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: When was that?
Lisbeth Barnes: It would have been January 1992, I think.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you allow your son --
Lisbeth Barnes: January, February.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you allow your son to travel with Mr. Jackson?
Lisbeth Barnes: I allowed him, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Why was that?
Lisbeth Barnes: Because, to me, it was a learning experience, and -- visiting other countries, and I couldn't -- you know, I was -- it didn't bother me at all.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever suspect that Mr. Jackson had inappropriately touched your son?
Lisbeth Barnes: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you discussed with your son allegations that Mr. Jackson inappropriately touched him?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, there were allegations, and we had talked about it, and I have asked him. I said, “Look me in the eyes and tell me that nothing has happened to you, that Michael has never done anything inappropriate to you”. And he said he --
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to object to the response as hearsay, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Move to strike the answer.
The Court: Stricken.
Mr. Mesereau: As you sit here today, do you think Mr. Jackson has ever inappropriately touched your son?
Mr. Zonen: I believe that's character opinion. I'll object, unless this witness is a character witness.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: Miss Barnes, good morning.
Lisbeth Barnes: Good morning.
Mr. Zonen: Your child Brett was how old when he first met Michael Jackson?
Lisbeth Barnes: Nine.
Mr. Zonen: And was that on the occasion of your first visit?
Lisbeth Barnes: Going on ten. Yes.
Mr. Zonen: He was nine years old?
Lisbeth Barnes: He may have been ten.
Mr. Zonen: And your daughter was how old?
Lisbeth Barnes: 12.
Mr. Zonen: And your daughter's name is what?
Lisbeth Barnes: Karlee.
Mr. Zonen: Karlee? Am I doing that right? Karlee?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh. K-a-r-l-e-e.
Mr. Zonen: And both of them stayed with Michael Jackson that first night that you were at Neverland?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, we all stayed together and they -- like I said, they slept in the -- in one of the guest units, and we slept in the other guest unit.
Mr. Zonen: They slept in one of the guest units. Who are “they”?
Lisbeth Barnes: My children. Brett and Karlee.
Mr. Zonen: All right. They both stayed in one of the guest units?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: And you stayed in a separate guest unit?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: And Mr. Jackson stayed in his residence?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And the guest unit, of course, is an entirely different structure than his residence; is that right?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: You would have to walk outside and some distance before you would get to his house?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: Did you continue to stay in the guest unit while you were there?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And for what period of time did you stay at Neverland before you finally returned to Australia?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, we were -- we were at Neverland on -- on and off for over a three-week period, but we didn't stay at Neverland the whole time.
Mr. Zonen: How long did you stay at Neverland?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, it was a few days in Neverland and a few days outside of Neverland, coming back, so altogether -- I couldn't tell you exactly how many days altogether.
Mr. Zonen: Was your husband there as well?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, he was.
Mr. Zonen: And other members of your family?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, my son and my daughter, and that's the complete family.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. You didn't have any aunts or grandparents or cousins or anything like that?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: So it was the four of you; is that correct?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: And you wandered between Neverland and other locations in California; is that right?
Lisbeth Barnes: And Las Vegas.
Mr. Zonen: And Las Vegas. Did you travel with Mr. Jackson during that time?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: So he took you to different locations; is that right?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: At what stage did your son begin to stay in his room or with him in a hotel room, together?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: Well, the first time you're telling us --
Lisbeth Barnes: It's not the first few nights. It could be -- I'm not really sure exactly when.
Mr. Zonen: By about the third night?
Lisbeth Barnes: Could be. It could be a little bit later.
Mr. Zonen: Fourth night?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: This is a trip that went about three weeks; is that right?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: The trip was paid for entirely by Mr. Jackson?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: And that included all of the transportation for you, your husband and your two children from Australia to California and back; is that right?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: As well as all of your housing accommodations, travel needs and entertainment; is that right?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: Did he purchase gifts for the four of you while he was there?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, he did.
Mr. Zonen: And by the fourth night, your son was sleeping in his room; is that correct?
Lisbeth Barnes: No, I didn't say by the fourth night he was sleeping in his room.
Mr. Zonen: What night was it, then?
Lisbeth Barnes: I'm not sure what night it was.
Mr. Zonen: Was it within the first week?
Lisbeth Barnes: It could have been. It may have been. It may not have been. I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: But he was sleeping with your son in the same bed before this trip was over; is that correct?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Was he sleeping in the same bed with your son for an extended period of time?
Lisbeth Barnes: On -- no, not -- not continuously, no. Just on-and-off basis when they were -- the times when my son would fall asleep when we were there, and he stayed there and -- rather than having to go back to -- outside into the unit.
Mr. Zonen: Your Honor?
The Court: Thank you. We'll take our break.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: You may proceed.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Zonen: Miss Barnes, we were on a -- the initial visit, your initial visit to California to Neverland, and I believe you were telling us --
Bailiff Cortez: Your microphone's off.
Mr. Zonen: We were discussing your initial visit to California and to Neverland, and I believe that you said it was when your son was about nine years old. How much older was your daughter?
Lisbeth Barnes: I said ten, actually. Nearly ten.
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry, ten years old he was?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, he was going to be ten in January, so it was December, so he was nearly --
Mr. Zonen: Close to his tenth birthday?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: And your daughter was how old at the time?
Lisbeth Barnes: 12.
Mr. Zonen: And you took trips with the defendant to a number of different locations, including Las Vegas?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: What other cities did you go to besides Las Vegas?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, Los Angeles. We went to Disneyland. This is Anaheim, I believe --
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Where else?
Lisbeth Barnes: -- on that trip. That's about it, I think.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Would it be fair to say that most of the time that you were there, you were at Neverland; is that correct?
Lisbeth Barnes: Not quite. Not really, no, because we spent a few days in Las Vegas. We spent a few days at Disneyland. And when we were in Disneyland, I know we went to Century City, so I'd say -- I wouldn't say most of the time, no.
Mr. Zonen: Well, a few days in Century City?
Lisbeth Barnes: A hotel there. There's a hotel in Century City.
Mr. Zonen: Was that across the street from his condominium?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: When you were at the hotel in Century City, was your son staying with Mr. Jackson in his condominium?
Lisbeth Barnes: No, he stayed with us.
Mr. Zonen: He stayed with you for the entire time?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: When you were at the Las Vegas hotel, did your son stay with Mr. Jackson?
Lisbeth Barnes: We were all together.
Mr. Zonen: In Mr. Jackson's room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, we shared a villa, so there were several rooms in the villa. It's like a --
Mr. Zonen: And in which room did your son sleep?
Lisbeth Barnes: With my daughter.
Mr. Zonen: Your son slept with your daughter?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: So he didn't stay with Mr. Jackson at any time while you were in Las Vegas?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't recall. I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: He didn't stay with Mr. Jackson at any time when you were in Century City?
Lisbeth Barnes: He may have. I'm not sure. No, I'm not -- I cannot tell you, because I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: Did you stay at a hotel when you were at Disneyland?
Lisbeth Barnes: We were at The Disneyland Hotel.
Mr. Zonen: For how long? More than one night?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Two nights?
Lisbeth Barnes: Probably four, five nights, I would say.
Mr. Zonen: Four or five nights?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: At Disneyland Hotel?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: And did your son stay with Mr. Jackson while --
Lisbeth Barnes: We were all, again, in the same --
Mr. Zonen: Suite?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did your son stay in Mr. Jackson's room in that suite while you were at The Disneyland Hotel?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't remember. Possibly. I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: You're not certain?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Now, the first time that your son ended up staying in Mr. Jackson's room, had you had a conversation with Mr. Jackson prior to that event? Did Mr. Jackson talk with you about your son staying with him in his room?
Lisbeth Barnes: No. It was my son's decision to stay the night.
Mr. Zonen: It was your son's decision to stay?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: Well, explain how that happened.
Lisbeth Barnes: He wanted --
Mr. Zonen: Your son came to you and asked you if he could stay with Mr. Jackson?
Lisbeth Barnes: No, we just happened to be in the room, and he said he wanted to stay. He wanted to stay there for the night, because they were having fun, and he -- he just said he was going to stay there and --
Mr. Zonen: Was this is at Neverland we're talking about?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: It's not at one of the hotels?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: It's before you began your series of trips around different places; is that correct?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct. Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: So it was in the early part of your stay in California?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, I would say so.
Mr. Zonen: And your son came to you -- and your son came to you and said that he would like to spend the night --
Lisbeth Barnes: He didn't come to me. Well, I was there with him.
Mr. Zonen: And your daughter was there as well?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: You were all on the bed together?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, we were in the room together.
Mr. Zonen: Which room is that? The downstairs room?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: And there is a bed in the downstairs room?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: And there's a bed in the upstairs room?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: Were you watching T.V.?
Lisbeth Barnes: We were at the time. I don't remember what we were doing. I'm sorry.
Mr. Zonen: Was your husband there as well?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: Was your daughter there as well?
Lisbeth Barnes: I presume so.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know at what hour it was that your son --
Lisbeth Barnes: No, I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: -- that your son expressed the desire to remain in Mr. Jackson's room?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: Was it late at night?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't remember. I'm sorry.
Mr. Zonen: Was it potentially very early in the morning?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't -- I don't remember. I'm sorry. I just don't remember. It was just a long time ago.
Mr. Zonen: Did you understand him to mean that he was going to be sleeping in Mr. Jackson's bed?
Lisbeth Barnes: I would imagine so, because eventually he would have fallen asleep.
Mr. Zonen: Is that where he was at the time that you left the room?
Lisbeth Barnes: What do you mean?
Mr. Zonen: At the time that your son said he wanted to stay there, was Mr. Jackson there?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, he was.
Mr. Zonen: Was Mr. Jackson on the bed?
Lisbeth Barnes: No. He was just in the room, sitting on one of the chairs, walking around. He likes walking around.
Mr. Zonen: He walks around?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: So he was walking around, and your son was on the bed?
Lisbeth Barnes: I'm not really sure whether he was on the bed or whether he was playing with something on the floor, or --
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember the conversation where he asked you -- your son asked you to remain in Mr. Jackson's room? Do you remember that conversation?
Lisbeth Barnes: No, I don't.
Mr. Zonen: But you do remember -- but you do remember that it was your son who asked if he could stay there?
Lisbeth Barnes: It was his decision, yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was Mr. Jackson party to that conversation?
Lisbeth Barnes: No. Well, he was there. But he wasn't party to -- he wasn't actually taking part in the conversation, if that's what you mean.
Mr. Zonen: Did you say to your son, “No, that's not appropriate. Come back to the guest cottage with your family”?
Lisbeth Barnes: No, I didn't.
Mr. Zonen: You said it was all right for him to stay in that room?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did Mr. Jackson say to you, “It's okay with me, he can stay here”? Did he say that to you?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, I don't remember what he said at the time. I just asked him if it was okay. And --
Mr. Zonen: Who asked who if it was okay?
Lisbeth Barnes: I asked Mr. Jackson if it was okay, and he said, “Yes. If he wants to stay, that's fine”.
Mr. Zonen: So you did have a conversation with Mr. Jackson about your son remaining?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, I can't say that it's a conversation. If I just asked him something, it's not really a conversation as far as I'm concerned, I'm sorry.
Mr. Zonen: Now, your son at the time was almost ten years old?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: And Mr. Jackson at the time was in his mid-30s?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Had your son slept with any other man in his mid-30s up to that point other than a relative?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, he slept with my brother at my parents' place.
Mr. Zonen: Do you understand your brother to be a relative?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. The prosecutor is not letting her complete her answer.
The Court: The objection is overruled. You may answer the last question. Do you want it read back?
Lisbeth Barnes: I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear.
The Court: I'll have the court reporter read it to you.
The Court Reporter: Do you understand your brother to be a relative?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Do you understand that the question I asked was other than relatives? Had your son, at that point in his life, slept with any other men other than relatives; adult, grown men?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Since that date, has he slept with any adult, grown men during the balance of his adolescence other than a relative?
Lisbeth Barnes: Not that I know.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Now, Miss Barnes, at the time that he first spent the night in Mr. Jackson's room, in Mr. Jackson's bed, you had known Mr. Jackson what, a couple days?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, I had met him a couple of days, but I had known him -- I had been friends with him -- I consider myself being friends with him, because we had communicated over the phone for several years prior to that.
Mr. Zonen: You'd had telephone conversations --
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: -- with him. The first time that you actually spent any time in his home with him was the occasion of this first visit just prior to your son's --
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: -- tenth birthday. All right. Did your son continue to sleep with him thereafter?
Lisbeth Barnes: Not every day.
Mr. Zonen: But many days?
Lisbeth Barnes: On occasions.
Mr. Zonen: And your son visited Mr. Jackson on a regular basis over the years for the balance of his adolescence, did he not?
Lisbeth Barnes: And we did as a -- we did as -- my daughter, myself and my son. We did.
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Lisbeth Barnes: And my husband was present on occasions, but he had to work on other occasions.
Mr. Zonen: Yes. And other occasions your son came by himself?
Lisbeth Barnes: And other occasions, yes, he did come by himself.
Mr. Zonen: Some occasions he went with you?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: On some occasions he traveled with Mr. Jackson extensively, did he not?
Lisbeth Barnes: I would say so.
Mr. Zonen: He traveled rather extensively with Mr. Jackson throughout the United States, didn't he?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know how many cities he traveled with your son, he traveled to with your son?
Lisbeth Barnes: I couldn't tell you how many cities, no.
Mr. Zonen: Were you present when he traveled through the United States with your son?
Lisbeth Barnes: To some places I was present, yes.
Mr. Zonen: Which places were you present?
Lisbeth Barnes: Chicago, Las Vegas. I'm not really sure. There were several occasions where I was present.
Mr. Zonen: Several occasions beyond Chicago and Las Vegas?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, not several cities, but several occasions where --
Mr. Zonen: Were you with your son on all of the occasions when he traveled with Mr. Jackson throughout the United States?
Lisbeth Barnes: Not all. Not all the occasions, no.
Mr. Zonen: Were there occasions when you stayed back in Australia?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, there were occasions when I stayed back.
Mr. Zonen: And your husband stayed back in Australia as well?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: For what periods of time would your son be in California or traveling in the United States with Mr. Jackson without you being there?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't recall.
Mr. Zonen: And you have no idea what cities they went to?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, I have an idea of some of the cities they went to.
Mr. Zonen: All right. You just said Las Vegas and Chicago. Do you remember any of the others?
Lisbeth Barnes: I know that he's been to New York with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: He went to New York. Okay. Where else?
Lisbeth Barnes: Chicago.
Mr. Zonen: And Chicago?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't really recall any other cities in the United States.
Mr. Zonen: May I approach the witness?
The Court: You may.
Mr. Mesereau: May I see?
Mr. Zonen: Same ones we did yesterday.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, okay.
Mr. Zonen: I'd like to show you a series of photographs, if I may, and please tell me if you recognize these photographs. Number 889 I'll begin with; two photographs in the front, two photographs in the back. Go ahead and look at the back side as well.
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: Who's the subject of those photographs?
Lisbeth Barnes: My son.
Mr. Zonen: Brett?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: And approximately how old was he when those pictures were taken?
Lisbeth Barnes: Like I said, probably about ten, I guess. 10, 11.
Mr. Zonen: Do you have a recollection of those pictures being taken?
Lisbeth Barnes: These ones, definitely, because he was just playing games. And him and my daughter were playing games in the photo box, and they were just pulling faces.
Mr. Zonen: This is a photo box at Neverland?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And the two photographs you're talking about are the two on the back side of 889; is that correct?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: How about the two photographs on the front side of 889, do you recognize those?
Lisbeth Barnes: No, I don't recognize anyone's face in those.
Mr. Zonen: Do you recognize the setting?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe I do, yes.
Mr. Zonen: And where is that?
Lisbeth Barnes: Or do I? No, I'm not really sure actually.
Mr. Zonen: That's fine. Take a look at Exhibit 890, two photographs in the front. Do you recognize the two photographs?
Lisbeth Barnes: No, I don't.
Mr. Zonen: Do you recognize the people in either of the two photographs?
Lisbeth Barnes: I do.
Mr. Zonen: Who are they?
Lisbeth Barnes: The top photo is Mr. Jackson, and -- I believe so. And -- I need my glasses for that one. And the bottom one is my son.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Number 891, do you recognize the subject matter of those two photographs?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe they're Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Are you familiar with the setting of those photographs? Were you there when they were taken?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: You don't have a recollection of these photographs being taken; is that correct?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: The three photographs on the back of 891, do you recognize those?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe them to be Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: Number 892, two photographs in the front.
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: Who are they?
Lisbeth Barnes: The top one of my son Brett, and the bottom one of my son with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: How old do you believe Brett is in those photographs?
Lisbeth Barnes: About 12, I would say. Probably 12, 13. Probably 12, I'd say.
Mr. Zonen: He had long hair that he wore at the time?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: Did he wear long hair for a number of years like that?
Lisbeth Barnes: He did. And then he had -- he had a haircut in 1993, and then he grew it again.
Mr. Zonen: On the back side of Exhibit No. 892, who is that?
Lisbeth Barnes: Again, my son with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: Number 893?
Lisbeth Barnes: Same.
Mr. Zonen: Again, your son and Mr. Jackson, both photographs?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: And the photograph on the back, the top one --
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: -- is your son?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. And the bottom one as well?
Lisbeth Barnes: The bottom one is my son.
Mr. Zonen: Number 894, four photographs?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh. Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: And the two on the back?
Lisbeth Barnes: Again, Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: And 895, we have two photographs in the front and four on the back.
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh. My son.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Now, 896, we have two photographs in the front and two on the back. Take a look at these and tell me if you recognize them.
Lisbeth Barnes: No, I don't believe I know the location.
Mr. Zonen: The two photographs on the back and the one photograph on the front on the bottom are of buildings and a skyline; is that right?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. And you don't remember that setting at all? That's not familiar to you?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Did you travel to Chicago with your son and Mr. Jackson?
Lisbeth Barnes: I did on one occasion, with -- when he was filming the video for the song “Jam” with -- with Mr. Michael Jordan in that video. Yes, that was the occasion I traveled with --
Mr. Zonen: Where did your son stay in Chicago during that trip?
Lisbeth Barnes: He stayed with -- with me at times and --
Mr. Zonen: With Mr. Jackson?
Lisbeth Barnes: -- with Mr. Jackson at times, yes.
Mr. Zonen: Yeah. How long did that tour go on? Was he actually on a tour?
Lisbeth Barnes: No, that was just a few days that we went to Chicago, and then we had to come back. We had to go back again.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember how old your son was at that time?
Lisbeth Barnes: About 11.
Mr. Zonen: Between the ages of ten and --
Lisbeth Barnes: Ten.
Mr. Zonen: -- and 13, how often did your son travel to Neverland?
Lisbeth Barnes: Several times.
Mr. Zonen: “Several times” meaning what?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: More than once a year?
Lisbeth Barnes: I would say probably, yes.
Mr. Zonen: More than twice a year?
Lisbeth Barnes: Probably, on average, about two, three times.
Mr. Zonen: Two or three times a year. On how many of those occasions did you accompany him to Neverland between the ages of 10 and 13?
Lisbeth Barnes: Most of the time I did.
Mr. Zonen: Now, your son traveled with him extensively in South America, did he not?
Lisbeth Barnes: No, we were present, my family. My husband, my daughter and I were present when we toured South America.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And how long of a tour was that?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't quite remember. Couple months maybe. I'm not sure. I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: Did you travel for the entirety of that tour?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: So for a couple months you traveled throughout South America?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: And your son was there as well the entire time?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct. And my daughter and my husband.
Mr. Zonen: Your daughter and your husband and you for the entire time?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: That was a couple months?
Lisbeth Barnes: I would say probably -- it could be -- could have been three months. I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: Three months?
Lisbeth Barnes: Could have been.
Mr. Zonen: Your husband was able to take three months off from work?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, because he had long service leaves.
Mr. Zonen: He had what?
Lisbeth Barnes: Long -- in Australia, after you work for, say, ten years, you're entitled to long service leave, so you have three months every ten years. And he had two lots of long-service leave that he was able to take.
Mr. Zonen: And that trip was paid for entirely by Mr. Jackson, was it not?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: And is it true that during the entirety of that trip your son slept in Mr. Jackson's room with Mr. Jackson?
Lisbeth Barnes: I wouldn't say during the entirety.
Mr. Zonen: Most of it?
Lisbeth Barnes: I would say at times.
Mr. Zonen: At times?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: What does that mean? Once a week?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, I can't give you an exact number of times, because it happened quite a while.
Mr. Zonen: Your son was how old at that point, the time of the South America trip?
Lisbeth Barnes: 12, I would say.
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry?
Lisbeth Barnes: 12. I --
Mr. Zonen: 12? 12 years old? Did your husband ever express any concerns to you about your son sleeping in the same bed with Mr. Jackson?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever discuss it with him at all?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes. We talked -- well, we didn't see any -- any reason -- we talked about it. It wasn't a discussion, as such, that -- because I couldn't make a decision and say, “Well, yes, it's okay”, and not consult my husband, because he's part of the family. So....
Mr. Zonen: So at some point in time there was a discussion that you had with your husband about your son sleeping with Michael Jackson?
Lisbeth Barnes: A conversation that we decided whether we should -- whether it was okay, because we didn't want to impose on Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: Was this the sole issue that you were dealing with was whether or not your son sleeping with him was an imposition for Mr. Jackson? That was the sole concern you had?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: How many conversations did you have with your husband about the question of where your son slept?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: More than ten?
Lisbeth Barnes: No. I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember at what age your child was at the time of that discussion?
Lisbeth Barnes: No. I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: He could have been ten?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't remember. I'm sorry.
Mr. Zonen: Could have been 13?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know if he had already been sleeping with Mr. Jackson for a period of three or four years by the time you had this conversation with your husband?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't think so.
Mr. Zonen: Well --
Lisbeth Barnes: I think it would have been before, before that.
Mr. Zonen: Perhaps a year?
Lisbeth Barnes: No. It would have been at the beginning, I guess.
Mr. Zonen: So your son was closer to age ten, or perhaps age ten at the time this happened?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct. Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And then your discussion with your husband took place where? Was it in Australia or was it in the United States?
Lisbeth Barnes: While we were here.
Mr. Zonen: So “here” being what? Neverland, California?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: So early on, then. Was it perhaps the first visit that you had taken to Neverland?
Lisbeth Barnes: I'm sorry?
Mr. Zonen: Was it perhaps the first visit that you had taken to Neverland?
Lisbeth Barnes: What's the question?
Mr. Zonen: The question of when you had the conversation with Mr. -- with your husband about your son sleeping with Michael Jackson.
Lisbeth Barnes: I would say that would have been perhaps at the -- during the first visit, yes.
Mr. Zonen: During the first visit?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: And the only subject of that conversation with your husband was whether or not it inconvenienced Mr. Jackson to have your son in bed with him; is that true?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: Did Mr. Jackson ever tell you that he thought of you as family?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did he do that often?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe so, yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did he encourage you to think of him as family?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And did he, in fact, suggest that you consider that he be family to you?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: Did he tell you that he was going to be in the picture for a long time with you and your family?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: That he would be a friend to you and your family and assistance, and that he would have your family as his family?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, that we would be his friends for a long time, yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever tell him that you loved him as much as you loved any other member of your family, including your children?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe that I would have said that I love him very much.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever tell him that you loved him as much as any other member of your family, including your children, as much as you love your children?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't remember saying that.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever send Mr. Jackson any letters?
Lisbeth Barnes: I probably have.
Mr. Zonen: Did Mr. Jackson ever ask you to leave Neverland?
Lisbeth Barnes: Never.
Mr. Zonen: Did you believe that you had to leave Neverland at some point?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: Was Mr. Jackson going to send you to Paris?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: May I approach the witness, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Mr. Mesereau, here's the original of the letter I gave you.
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to show you Exhibit 897, 8-9-7, a two-page letter. Go ahead and take a moment and look at it. You can hold on to it. I may ask you a couple questions about it. Did you read the letter in its entirety?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: Do you recognize that letter?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: Is that a letter that you wrote?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe so, yes.
Mr. Zonen: It's in your handwriting?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, it is.
Mr. Zonen: Do you have a recollection of having written it?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: Is it true that you said in that letter, “I love my family deeply, and I love you as much as I love them”?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe -- well, I've read this. Yes, I did say that.
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry?
Lisbeth Barnes: I did write that, yes.
Mr. Zonen: And was that a true statement when you wrote it?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes. Well, I wanted to let Mr. Jackson know that I loved him very much, and I -- I believe that I had hurt him at some stage because I was behaving inappropriately. And that's why I wanted to apologize profusely, just to let him know that I was regretful of what I had done.
Mr. Zonen: This was written September 9th, 1992; is that correct?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct, yes.
Mr. Zonen: You wrote in the letter that, “Bill told you yesterday we were responsible for your illness. I felt like killing myself”.
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: And that is something that you wrote; is that correct?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: All right. “Bill” is who? Bill Bray?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: Who is Bill Bray?
Lisbeth Barnes: He was Mr. Jackson's head of security.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. And in 1992, your son was how old?
Lisbeth Barnes: Ten. Oh, 10 going on 11 at that stage. Ten and a half.
Mr. Zonen: So you had known Mr. Jackson about a year at that point?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: What illness was it that you believed that you were responsible for?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, from -- from my recollection of this particular incident, we were on tour and -- with Mr. Jackson on -- in the European tour of the “Dangerous” tour --
Mr. Zonen: Ma'am, what illness was it that you believed --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. He's cutting off the witness.
Mr. Zonen: I'll object as nonresponsive, the answer.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Tell us what illness it was that Mr. Jackson had that you believed you were responsible for.
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't recall what the illness was.
Mr. Zonen: But it was serious enough that you felt like killing yourself?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, it was probably a bit overdramatic what I had written there, but it was only because I felt so bad about it.
Mr. Zonen: But now you don't even remember what illness it was?
Lisbeth Barnes: No, I don't remember what the actual illness was, but I remember that I had caused him some grief.
Mr. Zonen: Did he have an illness that required medical attention?
Lisbeth Barnes: I'm not sure whether it actually required medical attention, but I know that he felt that he was feeling unwell at the time.
Mr. Zonen: Feeling unwell physically or emotionally?
Lisbeth Barnes: I guess probably emotionally. I don't know. But all I know, that he was feeling unwell. I don't really know the extent of -- I don't remember what -- what -- actually how he was feeling, what the actual feeling was, whether it was physical or whether it was emotional. I don't have any recollection of that.
Mr. Zonen: And was this because of an outburst of some kind that you staged?
Lisbeth Barnes: Pretty much. Well, it was a personal matter between Mr. Jackson and myself.
Mr. Zonen: What did you say to him --
Lisbeth Barnes: Um --
Mr. Zonen: -- that caused you to feel like killing yourself?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, this is -- the reason why I felt so bad is because it was -- I -- what happened was that during the tour, there was a particular city that we were visiting. There wasn't quite enough VIP passes for everyone, because they had VIP passes for numerous guests.
Mr. Zonen: What city were you in?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't actually recall which city.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. The prosecutor interrupted.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: May the witness be allowed to complete her answer, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: I'll object to the narrative form of the answer.
The Court: Well, you asked the question.
Mr. Zonen: I'll withdraw my objection, Judge. I'm sorry.
The Court: Go ahead. Do you want the part that you've already said read back, so you can complete your answer?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's -- please.
The Court: All right.
The Court Reporter: What city were you in?
Lisbeth Barnes: And I was informed that we -- I wasn't able to go and see the show. And I was upset over that, and that's -- I'm ashamed to be telling this to everyone, but that's pretty much what happened. And I didn't realize that particular outburst was going to make him feel bad. And what happened was that he explained to me that he had several things on his mind and that he wanted to make us happy, and because I was being -- I was unhappy, that was causing him grief. And so I felt pretty much disgusted with myself for having --
Mr. Zonen: What city were you in?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't recall which city it was. It was a city before -- possibly before Paris, or -- I'm not really sure.
Mr. Zonen: What country were you in?
Lisbeth Barnes: Again, I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: You were in Europe?
Lisbeth Barnes: We were in Europe, yes.
Mr. Zonen: So you've done tours with Michael Jackson in Europe, in South America, and in the United States?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, I didn't actually tour with Mr. Jackson in the United States.
Mr. Zonen: All right. On this particular occasion, the occasion of writing this letter, you were someplace in Europe; is that right?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct, yes.
Mr. Zonen: And you had some kind of an outburst that upset him deeply?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: All right.
Lisbeth Barnes: And it was to do with the fact that --
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry?
Lisbeth Barnes: It was to do with the fact that I didn't -- I wasn't able to go to a particular show.
Mr. Zonen: And to whom did you complain about not being able to go to this show?
Lisbeth Barnes: I believe it was with -- possibly with Mr. Bray and with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: So Mr. Jackson was there at the time?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, he was.
Mr. Zonen: And you had an outburst, complaining about not being able to go --
Lisbeth Barnes: I call it an outburst, but it was the fact that I showed my displeasure, and that -- because I was upset, in a way that upset him, because he wanted us to be -- to be happy and to enjoy the tour, and it seemed like I wasn't because I wasn't able to go to one of the shows. And it was very petty and -- on my behalf.
Mr. Zonen: Actually, you didn't say “outburst”, you said “outbursts”, plural. You had a few of them, didn't you?
Lisbeth Barnes: No, I didn't have a few outbursts. But probably -- it could have been because I -- I had expressed my displeasure with Mr. Bray and then with Mr. Jackson. That could have been why it's in plural.
Mr. Zonen: Now, because you had an outburst over your displeasure at not going to a concert, you felt like killing yourself, and you wrote that in a letter to Mr. Jackson?
Lisbeth Barnes: I did, but that -- again, like I said, it's probably an overdramatic statement because of the fact that I felt so bad. I wanted to let him know how bad I felt, but I had no intention of killing myself. But it's just to -- that was just an expression to let him know that I was very, very remorseful and how bad I felt about it because of the fact that I had been selfish.
Mr. Zonen: Did your son actually go to that concert?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, he did.
Mr. Zonen: Was --
Lisbeth Barnes: No, no, sorry, he didn't go to the concert, but he was on the tour with us, yes.
Mr. Zonen: He did not go to that concert either?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't believe so.
Mr. Zonen: Did you tell Mr. Jackson in this letter that you were prepared to leave?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: Did you tell him, “The only thing that we will not do, we will not leave without Brett, and that could be a bit of a problem”?
Lisbeth Barnes: That's correct. Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you anticipate at that point that Brett would not want to go with you if you left?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, because Brett was having such a great time and he would have been very disgruntled about having to leave and probably would have been throwing tantrums, I guess.
Mr. Zonen: You wrote, “If the Paris business bothers you, we would be quite happy to go someplace else to avoid any situation”; is that right?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What's “the Paris business”?
Lisbeth Barnes: Well, that could have been that -- that occasion that -- the concert, that particular concert I'm talking about.
Mr. Zonen: So you think it might have been in Paris that you had an outburst?
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes. Whether the concert was in Paris or not, I'm not sure. But it was in Paris that actually --
Mr. Zonen: Was your son sleeping with Michael Jackson during the course of that tour in Europe?
Lisbeth Barnes: At some time, yes. At some stage.
Mr. Zonen: Well, how often would he spend nights with Mr. Jackson as opposed to his family?
Lisbeth Barnes: I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have a conversation with an investigator for the defense last night?
Lisbeth Barnes: Not last night, no.
Mr. Zonen: The night before?
Lisbeth Barnes: Not the night before, no.
Mr. Zonen: From yesterday at 2:30, from yesterday at 2:30 in the afternoon --
Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: -- did you discuss your testimony or anybody else's testimony with either Mr. Mesereau or any other member of the defense team, lawyer or investigator?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: You had no discussion with anybody from 2:30 on yesterday, no one at all?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: Nobody told you what questions you might be asked today based on yesterday's testimony?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you. I have no further questions.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:

Lisbeth Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you consider Mr. Jackson part of your family?

Mr. Mesereau: And he asked you questions about having to leave Neverland or something like that. Do you remember that?
Lisbeth Barnes: Uh-huh.

Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: With whom did you speak prior to your testimony today, at any time prior to today, about your testimony?
Lisbeth Barnes: Who do you mean? Anyone --
Mr. Zonen: At the time that you arrived in California, did you talk to anybody about your testimony?
Lisbeth Barnes: From the time I arrived in California, I had a meeting with Mr. Mesereau for about five to ten minutes. And with Mr. Scott Ross.
Mr. Zonen: For how long?
Lisbeth Barnes: For about probably --
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry?

Mr. Zonen: With whom did you speak?

Mr. Zonen: You had a conversation with Grace?

Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: So nobody had any idea what you would say before you arrived here?
Lisbeth Barnes: No.
Mr. Zonen: And then you had a total of 25 minutes of conversation between two different people?

Lisbeth Barnes: No. He never called me.
Mr. Zonen: Did he call your son?

Lisbeth Barnes: Yes, he did.
Mr. Zonen: And did he ask your son questions about what you would be saying as well?
Lisbeth Barnes: No. That was prior to me making that decision.

Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Good afternoon, Miss Barnes. Miss Barnes, where is your home?
Karlee Barnes: In Melbourne, Australia.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know the gentleman seated at counsel table to my right?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Who is that?
Karlee Barnes: That's Michael Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: And is he a friend of yours?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, very --
Mr. Mesereau: How long --
Karlee Barnes: Very good friend.
Mr. Mesereau: How long has he been a friend of yours?
Karlee Barnes: Well, about almost 18 years. We first started speaking on the telephone, and I've known him in person for about 13 years.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you first get in contact with Mr. Jackson?
Karlee Barnes: Well, it was pure luck really. When I was about seven years old or so, my brother and I were really, really great big fans of Michael, and my brother wanted to write a letter to him. So he -- well, with my assistance, we got a letter out to him, and we badly -- really, really badly wanted to go to his concert. That was his “Bad” tour. But my mom wouldn't let us go, because we were too small. We'd get crushed by the crowd. So as a consolation, she let us go see his arrival at the airport. And at the airport, he had a number of dancers and backup singers and band members there promoting, giving us show bags and things like that. So my mom handed the letter to one of his dancers, who put the letter into a mail bag. And fortunately, one day Michael decided to pull out a letter and read it, and he put his hand into the fan mail bag and he pulled out my brother's letter, read the letter, and he decided to telephone us to say thank you. And from there --
Mr. Mesereau: And approximately what year was that?
Karlee Barnes: It would have been about '87. Or '88.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you speak with him on the phone that time?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, I answered the telephone.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And this was in -- this was at your home?
Karlee Barnes: Yes. It was at home.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And how long did you speak to Michael Jackson?
Karlee Barnes: Well, when I answered the telephone, I -- you know, I said, “Hello?” And a voice comes back, “Hi. May I please speak to Brett?” And I was like, this isn't somebody I've spoken to before. And I said, “Brett Barnes?” And he's like, “Yes, please”. And I said, “Okay. I'll just go get him for you”. I put the phone down. And my mom said, “Who's on the phone?” And I said, “I don't know, but it sounds like Michael Jackson”. And so I ran outside, and I'm like, “Brett Brett, Brett, Michael Jackson's on the phone”, and we've gone running back inside. But after that, I was just too shy to speak to him, so it was really only when I answered the telephone that I spoke to him the first time.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When did you next have communication with Michael Jackson?
Karlee Barnes: It was -- it was such a long time, I really don't remember. But he did call us quite frequently from then on.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you used to speak to him from time to time?
Karlee Barnes: Yes. Of course, after I lost, you know, my shyness, I definitely loved getting on the telephone to speak.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you talk to him a lot?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you become his friend?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did your family become friends of Michael Jackson?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you're still his friend, right?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, definitely.
Mr. Mesereau: Where are you staying at the moment?
Karlee Barnes: I'm staying at his ranch, Neverland Valley.
Mr. Mesereau: And had you stayed there before this trip?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think you've stayed at Neverland?
Karlee Barnes: Oh, many, many times. I wouldn't know exactly.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And do you remember the first time you visited Neverland?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, that was just after I finished the sixth grade, so that would have been like the -- the Christmas of 1990, like 1991.
Mr. Mesereau: And who did you visit Neverland with, if you remember?
Karlee Barnes: My mom and my dad and my brother Brett.
Mr. Mesereau: How long were you there?
Karlee Barnes: Oh, that I really can't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. What's your first memory of Neverland when you first saw it?
Karlee Barnes: Oh, amazement. I was just so excited and so happy and just so thrilled to be there. And it was just -- it was like going into this -- I don't know, like this paradise that I've never seen before. And it was just, yeah, wonderful.
Mr. Mesereau: You still enjoy going there?
Karlee Barnes: Every time I come back it feels like I'm coming home.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, the first time you visited Neverland, do you recall where you stayed?
Karlee Barnes: Yes. The first time my brother and I stayed in Unit 3.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And have you ever been in Michael Jackson's bedroom at Neverland?
Karlee Barnes: Yep.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall the first time you ever were in Michael Jackson's bedroom?
Karlee Barnes: Well, the first time we went to his bedroom was when we first met him, he came -- like our family was invited to meet him in his bedroom.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you been in his bedroom many times?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And describe his bedroom, if you would.
Karlee Barnes: Well, it's like a normal bedroom, really. He's got a bed, and he's got some chairs. And he's got a bathroom.
Mr. Mesereau: And it's two levels, right?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, that's right.
Mr. Mesereau: And what else have you seen in his room that you recall?
Karlee Barnes: At one stage he had, like, a throne in there, like a big chair. And he had books, and some things that fans have given to him, like a lot of memorabilia.
Mr. Mesereau: And have you ever spent the night in Michael Jackson's room?
Karlee Barnes: Yep.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think you've done that?
Karlee Barnes: Well, I don't remember exactly how many times, but I do recall at least twice.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever spent the night there with your brother?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Has Michael Jackson ever made you feel like you weren't welcome into his room?
Karlee Barnes: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Has he ever made you feel that you could go into his room whenever you wanted?
Karlee Barnes: Yeah. I mean, basically he's always said to us that his house is our house, we're free to go wherever we like whenever we like. It's out of personal respect that I, you know, wouldn't just walk anywhere, just, you know, because everybody deserves a little privacy.
Mr. Mesereau: Has Mr. Jackson ever made you feel unwelcome in his home at any time?
Karlee Barnes: Never, ever, ever.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever gone to his room and just knocked on the door?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And has he been in the room when you knocked on the door?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he let you in?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever been in Mr. Jackson's room with your mom?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think you've been in his room with your mom?
Karlee Barnes: Again, I'm not really sure, but it has been on more than one occasion.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, do you recall ever being in Mr. Jackson's room late at night?
Karlee Barnes: Yeah, I've stayed -- I've slept in his bedroom.
Mr. Mesereau: And what were you doing in his room at the time?
Karlee Barnes: Sleeping.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, besides sleeping. What --
Karlee Barnes: Oh, well --
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase the question. It's not a good question. Before you fell asleep in his room, what were you doing?
Karlee Barnes: We were all talking.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Karlee Barnes: And, you know, just having fun.
Mr. Mesereau: Uh-huh. What kind of fun?
Karlee Barnes: I don't know. The fun that kids have. Just making fun of each other and telling jokes. And, you know, doing silly dances, and, you know, just things like that.
Mr. Mesereau: And would Mr. Jackson do that with you?
Karlee Barnes: Yeah, he liked skipping and jumping, like all of us.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you done silly dances with Mr. Jackson?
Karlee Barnes: Yeah, we always like do, you know, crazy things.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you walked around Neverland with Mr. Jackson?
Karlee Barnes: Yeah, many times.
Mr. Mesereau: And what have you done when you did that? Excuse me. That's not a good question. When you walked around Neverland, what were you guys doing?
Karlee Barnes: Well, talking, telling jokes. Same sort of thing. You know, running as fast as we can, challenging each other to races. Stopping to look at the animals. And, you know, things like that.
Mr. Mesereau: And Mr. Jackson would do that with you?
Karlee Barnes: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Have you been to the theater at Neverland?

Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How about your brother?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever traveled with Mr. Jackson?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, I have.
Mr. Mesereau: And how many times have you done that?
Karlee Barnes: Well, I've been to, like -- well, in my first -- in seventh grade, I spent half of the year over in Europe with him. And in the eighth grade I spent half of the year over in South America. And I've been to Chicago. And we've been to Las Vegas. So I've been, you know, lucky, very fortunate. When he came to Australia for his “History” tour, he took us to South Australia and to Western Australia. So I've been on many, many trips with him.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever been into the -- in the swimming pool --
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: -- at Neverland?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And has Mr. Jackson been in there with you?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, he has.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever recall Mr. Jackson being pushed into the pool?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What happened?
Karlee Barnes: The boys -- like, there was myself and my brother and two of Michael's cousins. And we would just -- we'd been playing. We had had an egg hunt, because it was around Eastertime. And then the boys decided that they were going to be, you know, a bit more crazy, and they started throwing eggs at Michael and putting them in his hair, and then, you know, they pushed him into the pool just to taunt him even more.
Mr. Mesereau: Has Mr. Jackson ever hugged you?
Karlee Barnes: Yes. Many times.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever been suspicious when he hugged you?
Karlee Barnes: Never, ever.
Mr. Mesereau: Has Mr. Jackson ever kissed you?
Karlee Barnes: On the cheek, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever been suspicious of his behavior when he did that?
Karlee Barnes: No, never.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever hugged Mr. Jackson?
Karlee Barnes: Plenty of times.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever kissed Mr. Jackson?
Karlee Barnes: Of course. On the cheek.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever been suspicious of anything he did when you hugged or kissed him?
Karlee Barnes: No, never.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you seen Mr. Jackson hug your brother?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, I have.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you seen him kiss your brother?
Karlee Barnes: Yes. On the cheek, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you ever suspicious of the behavior when he did that?
Karlee Barnes: No, never, ever.

Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:
Mr. Auchincloss: Good afternoon, Miss Barnes.
Karlee Barnes: Hello.
Mr. Auchincloss: You are positively thrilled to be a friend of Michael Jackson's, aren't you?
Karlee Barnes: Absolutely.
Mr. Auchincloss: You seem almost giddy about it.
Karlee Barnes: I love him with all of my heart. I've known him since I was about seven or eight years old, so he's one of my closest fields.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you feel giddy when you're going to see him a little bit, excited?
Karlee Barnes: I feel no more excited than I would if I was seeing one of my other close friends that I haven't seen in a while.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, but he's different, isn't he?
Karlee Barnes: No, he's not. He's just a normal human being like anybody else. He's got the same organs, the same blood, the same emotions, the same feelings as anyone else.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, but not everybody has Neverland, true?
Karlee Barnes: Well, he's worked hard to get everything that he wants, so everything that he has he's worked really, really hard for.
Mr. Auchincloss: And he shares it with you?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you love going to Neverland?
Karlee Barnes: Of course I do.
Mr. Auchincloss: You get thrilled when you get to go there?
Karlee Barnes: Of course.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when you were a child and you got to go to Neverland, it's kind of like having everything you ever wanted as a kid, isn't it?
Karlee Barnes: It's like going to a theme park and a zoo all at once, yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: But it's better than that, isn't it?
Karlee Barnes: Well, I guess so, yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: Because it's all yours, it's all private, right? No other kids, no crowds?
Karlee Barnes: There are other kids, though, because, you know, it's even better when there are other people there to, you know, play games with, have fun with and share things with.
Mr. Auchincloss: Haven't you been there when it was just your family?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, I have.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you get to stay up late?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you get to have whatever you want to eat whenever you want it, right?
Karlee Barnes: Like when I'm on any other vacation or holiday, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you can play with Michael Jackson, the superstar, right?
Karlee Barnes: No, Michael Jackson, the human being.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, he is a superstar.
Karlee Barnes: Yeah, I recognize that, but he's also a normal human being like anybody else.
Mr. Auchincloss: But didn't you say that you were a huge fan of Michael Jackson's before you ever met him?
Karlee Barnes: Yes. Yes, I was. And I'm still a huge fan of his music today.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So you greatly admire him for that?
Karlee Barnes: I admire him for many things, yes, including his music.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Now, you testified a little bit about your experiences with Michael Jackson and your brother.
Karlee Barnes: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And the very first night that you went to Neverland, you spent all night in his bedroom, didn't you?
Karlee Barnes: Well, we didn't spend all night in his bedroom, no. We took a tour of the ranch. We went on the train that goes around the ranch. We saw, you know, as much we could of the theme park, the zoo. Because my brother and I were so excited to see a place we'd never been before, we spent the whole night trying to see everything all at once.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. But eventually you went back to Mr. Jackson's room, correct?
Karlee Barnes: We might have. I don't remember.
Mr. Auchincloss: Didn't you tell an investigator that; that you spent the entire first night at Neverland in Mr. Jackson's room?
Karlee Barnes: No, I didn't.
Mr. Auchincloss: You weren't playing video games in his room?
Karlee Barnes: I didn't say that, no.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you go into his room that night?
Karlee Barnes: I did go into his room that night when we first met him, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you stay up all night?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, I did stay up all night, as I said before, both of us.
Mr. Auchincloss: And --
Karlee Barnes: And I remember this because we slept the whole day the next day.
Mr. Auchincloss: It's nonresponsive. I'll object.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Now, Miss Barnes, how many nights have you spent at Neverland?
Karlee Barnes: I don't remember. It's been that many that I -- I simply can't recall.
Mr. Auchincloss: Hundreds, maybe?
Karlee Barnes: Well, I wouldn't say hundreds. But definitely more than 10, 20, 30 times, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: More than a 100?
Karlee Barnes: I don't remember, but maybe.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And of that 100 or so nights at Neverland, you've spent only two nights in Mr. Jackson's room?
Karlee Barnes: That I remember, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And of those 100 nights that you spent at Neverland, how many nights was Mr. Jackson there?
Karlee Barnes: Probably about 80, 90 percent.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And of that 100 nights, how many nights was your brother there?
Karlee Barnes: All the time.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Every time that you were there?
Karlee Barnes: Every time I was there, my brother was there, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And of those hundred or so nights, 80 percent of the time your brother slept -- when Mr. Jackson was there, your brother basically slept in Mr. Jackson's room virtually every one of those nights, didn't he?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, because he wanted to.
Mr. Auchincloss: That's a “yes” or “no” question.
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Can you tell me why you didn't spend the night in Mr. Jackson's room as much as your brother?
Karlee Barnes: Because I'm a girl, and I prefer to have a little bit of privacy.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. I see. Is it your opinion that -- well, let me back up. How old was your brother at that time?
Karlee Barnes: What, when we first started going to his house?
Mr. Auchincloss: Uh-huh.
Karlee Barnes: He was about -- well, I was about 12, so he was about ten.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So are you saying that it's okay for a 35-year-old man who's unrelated to sleep with a ten-year-old boy, but it's not okay for a 35-year-old man who's unrelated to a girl to sleep with her?
Karlee Barnes: I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that from my personal point of view, I was developing into an adult, and I was at the stage where I wanted my own privacy.
Mr. Auchincloss: Uh-huh.
Karlee Barnes: And there were times when I was happy to, you know, hang out with them and sleep in their room, and there were times when I wanted to have my own room.
Mr. Auchincloss: Only two nights that you felt like sleeping with them?
Karlee Barnes: That I remember, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you know that there were other boys that were at Neverland?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you see other boys when you were at Neverland?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you see them sleep in Mr. Jackson's room?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Jackson chose your brother to be a very special friend of his, didn't he?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, because the reason why --
Mr. Auchincloss: That's a “yes” or “no” question.
Karlee Barnes: Yes. Well, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you. Now, when you went on tour with Mr. Jackson, you spent how many nights on tour?
Karlee Barnes: Well, as I said, it was about half the year I was in Europe when I was in the seventh grade, and about half of the year I was in South America in the seventh -- in the eighth grade.
Mr. Auchincloss: How old was your brother at that time?
Karlee Barnes: I was what, 13, 14. So he would have been about 11 or 12.
Mr. Auchincloss: And virtually every night on that tour, Mr. Jackson slept with your brother Brett?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: How many nights would that have been, approximately?
Karlee Barnes: Let's see, let's divide 365 days into half.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Is that about it? About --
Karlee Barnes: Well, if I said I spent half the year overseas with him one year and half of the year overseas with him the other year, I think that would total about 365 days altogether.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So 365 nights he spent the night alone with your brother in his room?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did that ever -- did that ever seem odd to you?
Karlee Barnes: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Didn't seem odd to you that a 35-year-old man --
Karlee Barnes: Not at all.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- is sleeping with a ten-year-old boy?
Karlee Barnes: Not at all.
Mr. Auchincloss: During this entire period of time that you've known Mr. Jackson, has he given you gifts?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, he has.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he fly you over to the United States?
Karlee Barnes: Yes, he has.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you fly first class?
Karlee Barnes: I have flown first class, and I've also flown business class.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did your mother permit this?
Karlee Barnes: Yes. And so did my father.
Mr. Auchincloss: And do you know if your brother thinks it's a disgrace to be a victim of a child molestation?
Karlee Barnes: Of course he would. I do, too.
Mr. Auchincloss: So if he had to admit that, it would be disgraceful, wouldn't it?
Karlee Barnes: Well, no, it's a disgrace that it would happen to a child. Not a disgrace to admit that it happened, but a disgrace that it has happened, if it has happened.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you. No further questions.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor for the government asked you about your brother being a special friend of Michael Jackson. Are you a special friend of Michael Jackson?
Karlee Barnes: Yes. And my parents are as well.
Mr. Mesereau: Why?
Karlee Barnes: Well, because we treat him just as we would treat anybody else, as a normal human being. We don't take advantage of him, we trust him, we love him, and we give him a normal sense of life that so many other people never, ever do.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor for the government asked you about your brother sleeping with Michael Jackson, okay?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were traveling when your brother would be in Mr. Jackson's room, right?
Karlee Barnes: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever suspect anything improper was going on?
Karlee Barnes: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor for the government asked you if -- didn't it seem odd that Michael Jackson was in a room with your brother. Did you think it was odd?
Karlee Barnes: No, I didn't think it was odd.
Mr. Mesereau: Why?
Karlee Barnes: Because -- well, he's a family friend. He's like a brother to us. He's given us -- not just given us gifts and given us things, but he's -- you know, he's given us --
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; narrative.
The Court: Overruled. You may finish.
Karlee Barnes: He's given us friendship and, you know, experiences that we would never get to see, you know, and.... My brother really always wanted to be there. He wanted to spend every minute, and he still wants to spend all of his minute -- all his time with him.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; nonresponsive.
The Court: All right.
Karlee Barnes: And that's why it's not strange, because my brother wanted it.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; it's non- responsive.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor for the government asked you about victims of child molestation. Did you ever think your brother was a victim of child molestation?
Karlee Barnes: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever think you were a victim of child molestation --
Karlee Barnes: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: -- of Michael Jackson?
Karlee Barnes: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, have you learned about allegations in this courtroom that somehow your brother was improperly touched?
Karlee Barnes: I have heard that that has been said by other people.
Mr. Mesereau: What do you think of that?
Karlee Barnes: I think they're liars.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions.
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:
Mr. Auchincloss: Miss Barnes, has it ever occurred to you that virtually all families that have victims of child molestation where the molester is a friend and acquaintance, has it ever occurred to you that they are shocked and disbelieving when they learn that fact?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. No foundation; argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Goes to credibility.
The Court: The objection is sustained. Argumentative.
Mr. Auchincloss: Nothing further. There's no question.
The Court: That's true.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, okay.
The Court: But you could say, “No questions”. You may step down.
Karlee Barnes: Thank you.
The Court: (To the jury) I think it's time for you folks to go home. We've got a couple of things to do, and I think we'll just recess until Monday morning. Let me tell you another day we've just -- I've been asked if we could take the 20th of September, which is -- or “September”. (Laughter.)
The Court: I'm going to give you the 20th of September. The 20th of this month, May, one of the attorneys has asked -- one of the attorneys has a commitment which I'm going to allow him to keep. And I think it's good, too, that we get a break like that. So next Tuesday afternoon we're off, and the 20th of May. And we think we're on schedule, just so you're -- if you're wondering about that information. Everything looks like we're right on schedule. So see you Monday. Remember the admonitions.
Message: The following proceedings were held in open court outside the presence and hearing of the jury:
The Court: Mr. Sneddon, you had an issue you wanted to take up.
Mr. Sneddon: Yes. Actually, I have two issues, Your Honor.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: The first issue I'd like to address is a discovery issue, which has been an ongoing problem. And I wanted to alert the Court to the details and also make a record in that respect. We announced last week that we were going to rest, and then again the beginning of this week announced that we figured we'd be finished by Tuesday. We didn't. We finished on Wednesday. But when we began to ask for defense witnesses, we were given the name of six witnesses. Five of them were not even on the defense witness list, and the discovery was provided about five o'clock the day before we were to rest. Then we find out yesterday on the witness stand that one of the witnesses had signed a declaration that we hadn't been provided by the defense. Last Saturday, I faxed a letter to the defense, after having reviewed the defense witness list and compared that to our discovery, and there are at least 75 to 80 people listed on the defense list where we have no documentation or reason or reports or anything to indicate why those people are going to be called in this case. Since that time, I've further expanded my research on that issue. There are at least four employees from the ranch for which we have no reports on. Today there were three witnesses that they were going to call that we have no reports on, one of whom was not even on their witness list that was read to the jury. There are 21 celebrities that they mentioned in their witness list. Of those, 15 have no reports indicating what they're going to testify to. There are 12 Los Angeles Police Department officers, only six of which can we identify anything that shows their names in the reports. We have no idea what the others are going to testify to, and I might add that I don't think they know what they're going to be asked to testify to. In sum and substance, Your Honor, it is not my desire to prolong this case. I have every -- as much interest as this Court does in moving it. On the other hand, in being fair to us and the way that the Court required us to provide discovery to the defense, I think we've been placed in a very unfair posture at this point in the trial with regard -- for instance, just to use an example and then I'll just sit down. For example, two of the witnesses that were going to be called today, Detective Birchim and Jerome -- James --
Mr. Zonen: Jimmy Johnson.
Mr. Sneddon: It's not Jimmy Johnson. Van Norman. They were witnesses whose depositions were taken in a lawsuit for which we have not been able to gain access because there's Court orders sealing those records. And the defense knows that they're going to call these people as witnesses, yet they've never provided the transcripts to us, yet we provided all of the transcripts of everything we had during the 1993 investigation. That's the kind of disadvantage that we're being placed at, and I'm only asking the Court to hold the defense to the same standard that we're held to and were being held to during the presentation of our case. Now, I'm not unreasonable. I understand that there are going to be times when there are going to be things that are going to be turned over late. That happened to us. Somebody says something different or adds something to something at the last minute. But to have this kind of problem set forth when we're talking about literally hundreds of witnesses with no documentation, I think it's going to be very difficult for us to be prepared to continue and keep this trial moving on track. And I'm asking for the Court to enforce the provisions of the Penal Code that requires the defense to comply with discovery. Oh, I want to also add, some of the reports that we were provided at five o'clock on Tuesday night were reports that were dated in January. In other words, the defense had had them for four, five months. Oh, can I -- do you want me to tell you the second thing and I'll sit down, or do you want to do them separately?
The Court: Whatever you like.
Mr. Sneddon: Let me do it separately -- at the same time and get it done.
Mr. Sanger: At the same time; separate?
Mr. Sneddon: I indicated to the Court that it is our opinion, and we filed a brief on it this morning, that the defense has opened up the area of character evidence by introducing a lot of opinion evidence through all these witnesses, and we're asking the Court to hold a hearing as to what we are entitled to ask, in good faith, of have-you-heard questions and to have some of those people re-called as witness or for future witnesses that may stray into that area. Thank you.
The Court: I haven't seen that material yet.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
The Court: Usually it's brought over to me as soon as it's filed, so are you sure you filed it this morning?
Mr. Zonen: It was this morning.
Mr. Sneddon: I was under the impression it was filed this morning.
The Court: Okay. Usually I have it by now. As to the discovery issue?
Mr. Sanger: Yes. Before I address that, can I just -- on the matter of things getting to the Court, we also filed something this morning, and Your Honor, a little while ago, didn't have it.
The Court: Which was the -- yeah, I don't have that either.
Mr. Sanger: It was the response to --
The Court: I know what you're talking -- to the last item on --
Mr. Sanger: I remember sequentially what it was, but the substance is escaping me at the moment. Anyway, we did file it. It was on Mr. Viner's testimony.
The Court: Viner's testimony. Yes, I -- okay.
Mr. Sanger: Well, I suppose all I'm saying is, there may be a glitch somewhere in the conveyor belt from where it started and where it's coming.
The Court: I'll check.
Mr. Sanger: With regard to discovery, first of all, there's some factual inaccuracies in what Mr. Sneddon just said, one of which is he said that names were not on the witness list that we have included on our list of people that we're trying to give both the Court and counsel prior to calling them. And that is not correct. They are -- the ones that are added are at the end, starting on page 28 on the sixth amended witness list. So they were put on the witness list, but they are not alphabetical.
The Court: But you gave that list yesterday.
Mr. Sanger: No, it was -- this last one was a couple of days ago.
The Court: The day before?
Mr. Sanger: But we have -- well, there's two different lists. Let's just be clear, Your Honor.
The Court: I guess the question, though, is, does that really comply if you make a new list and put the name on it the day before you call a witness when you gave the real list several months ago? I mean, I find that to be a little --
Mr. Sanger: Let me address that before the Court forms an opinion on this - okay? - if I may.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sanger: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to misread what the Court was saying. What I -- what has happened is, we have witnesses on this -- on the big list that was provided originally in December. The prosecution filed one in December, and then we all filed amended ones in January, and both sides have tried to keep up, all right? The defense has had to react to certain things that have occurred. For instance, the prosecution has called some people that they indicated at first they weren't going to call, particularly on the 1108. Mr. Abdool was a late addition. He may have been on their master list, but when it came down to figuring who they were really going to call, they called a small percentage of the people they had on their master list.
The Court: I hope you do the same.
Mr. Sanger: And we will do the same unless Mr. Sneddon forces us to call every one just to show that we can do it. What we have done, seriously, is taken the master list, which had, oh, let's see, something like -- by the time we add all these other people, something like 500-and-some people on it. We've taken that master list -- now, the master list, our understanding of providing it was any name or any possible witness who could be called by either side or whose testimony would figure prominently in the case, or their presence, even if they didn't testify. So we were trying to provide the Court with something that the Court could read and ultimately have counsel read it to the jury so they could see if they knew any of these people. It did not mean that we were going to call everybody. And I think both sides know that, that that's the case. Now we're coming down to the people we're calling. We tried to give a list, not just for today, but we gave a list for a couple of three days' worth of witnesses. As I explained to Mr. Sneddon personally, and as they did, we have to shift things around as time goes on. We expected that, for instance, we were going to start earlier, and as a result of that, we had other witnesses who were going to be -- who were ready to be called, and now we've had to reschedule them because they're from out of town, and that's just the way it goes. So that's that. Now, of the people on the list, on our list that we gave to Your Honor and to the District Attorney, the short list, the -- the ones we're calling right now, there was one witness for which we had a declaration which we.... You have it. Okay. I take it you have Mr. Sneddon's as well.
The Court: Now I have each of those documents.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you. Of the people that Mr. Sneddon just referred to -- he said there were three people. Of those three people, there was one person, Francine Orozco, who we had a declaration from, and we believed that it had been turned over along with a whole series of declarations that had been turned over. They said they didn't get it. We went back. We can't show that we gave it to them. I gave a copy immediately to Mr. Zonen and agreed that we would not call Francine Orozco until they had a chance to review it. He said Monday would be fine, so I think we worked that out. We're trying to be reasonable on that. The other two, Russ Birchim is a sheriff's -- I believe he's a commander now, isn't he?
The Court: I think so.
Mr. Sanger: He's a commander, and the only thing we were going to ask him about is contained in his reports on this case, and we have not interviewed him independently. There was one other small issue we were going to ask about. I won't announce what it was. I've explained this to Mr. Zonen. It was an issue that he testified to in the Abdool trial. The Abdool court reporter's notes are, by and large, not available, and what few notes we got were such -- they were so garbled, we couldn't read it. In fact, the court reporter hired a computer expert to try to straighten it out and couldn't. We got no notes with regard to this person. So he testified. I told Mr. Zonen what he testified to, which was basically a one-sentence issue, and I said we weren't -- we weren't going to call him for that anyway. So the only issues we're calling him on would be issues for which he wrote a report in this case. The last witness they referred to, James Van Norman, we put on the list not to call him today, but to call him next week. We're just trying to give them a heads-up for a couple, three days, and we have not reinterviewed him. Now, I was just told today, and I wasn't aware of this, that the prosecution did not receive copies of the Abdool case. Because they had Mr. Ring on their witness list, my understanding was they had all the depositions and the files. All the public files have been ordered unsealed, with the exception of just a very few, thanks to Mr. Boutrous and his never-ending work over there in Judge Canter's court. I am now informed, as of today, that they did not have these depositions. I have not reviewed his deposition, and we have no new report. We expect to talk to him before bringing him up here again. I will get his deposition, to the extent we have it, from our old files. If we have it, we will give it to them. So that was really it. Now, as far as the rest of the people are concerned, we are -- to the extent we knew we were going to call them and we intended to call them and we interviewed them, we have provided reports. If we have any reports on anybody - in other words, anybody that's on the master list - that we intend to call, if we had a report, we turned it over, to the best of my knowledge. I don't know how Orozco slipped through as a declaration, but other than that, we have turned them over. We understand our obligations. I think we're complying with them. The People, as Mr. Sneddon acknowledged -- you know, there were -- a couple people actually got on the stand, as the Court may recall, and we didn't have a report from them at all. So it happens. The Court dealt with it and said, “Call them tomorrow”. I voluntarily said to do that with Miss Orozco. I suspect that we will cooperate in that regard. I don't think we're going to have a problem. We will have a further meeting today to make sure that all these Abdool depositions that pertain to witnesses we intend to call get turned over. So I think that really answers the question. We haven't been withholding anything. And I'd suggest -- rather than arguing back and forth, unless there's something I said that was factually inaccurate, I'd suggest we try to continue to work this out, because I have talked with Mr. Zonen and I thought we were doing fine.
The Court: Is there a way that you could -- here's the problem that I find from both sides, and that is that if there's no report, the party notifying the other side of the witness could make such a notation beside the name, so it's clear on the record to each other -- not for me, but to each other that there is no report, and it gives them a chance -- and if you say there is a report and they don't have it, they could get it to you immediately. There's a problem when you don't know if you're just not giving a report, forgot to give a report, or there's no report.
Mr. Sanger: More -- beyond that, I would go beyond that. There will be a report on everybody. I mean, even if the report is, “Their statement is their declaration”. We actually have one person at this point, the only statement that we could turn over was a statement that a lawyer -- paraphrase of what a lawyer told us. In other words, we haven't had a chance to interview that witness yet. We may or may not before the witness is called. If we do, we'll give a formal report. But we have provided that to the D.A. We'll let them know. There is the concept of rebuttal, and Mr. Mesereau is reminding me to just let the Court know. Obviously, a couple of these people, I think I said that at the very beginning --
The Court: I understood that.
Mr. Sanger: -- Orozco and Jimmy Van Norman are really rebuttal to what came up very recently in the case. It's not we're holding back. It's that we're responding the best we can to that. And we're starting with the '93 segment of the case, which I think is appropriate from our standpoint, but it also is the part where we have the real rebuttal burden because we didn't know whether it was coming in and what was coming in until late, so it's compounded that problem. But I think we're getting it done. So if there's any other problem, I would suggest we meet and confer. And -- hold on one second. I'm sorry. Yeah. (Discussion off the record at counsel table.)
Mr. Sanger: And I think the Court understands, for instance, there are experts like the financial expert who just came forward, and we got his PowerPoint I think the very morning he was put on, if I'm not mistaken. So, we -- we have to respond --
The Court: I understand there's always problems on both sides.
Mr. Sanger: We're doing our best is all I can tell you.
The Court: I expect you to comply, as I do both sides. Is there anything you want to add that?
Mr. Sneddon: Well, I'd like to get out of here early today, Judge, but I just want to say, are we to assume, then, from Mr. Sanger if we don't have a report from anybody, they made the decision not to call them? I mean, there's over 100 people on there, plus, that we --
Mr. Sanger: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, can we find out?
Mr. Sanger: There's 500 people on that original list.
Mr. Sneddon: With no indication why they're coming.
Mr. Sanger: Let's just make that clear. One more time, just like the prosecution gave us a giant list with a lot of people, we gave them a giant list with a lot of people. We're not going to call everybody on that list. So the prosecution can't assume anything from that. When we give them the list, which we typed out and gave the Court a copy and we gave the prosecution the same thing, when we do this, as we do this, we expect that there will be a report that's been disclosed on every single one of the people that we put on the list before we call them. And if we have it, we'll give it to them right now. If we're -- for instance, in the case of the one person who's not on the list yet, the one person who we've only talked to his lawyer, we can't give a further report until we get it. So that's the example. But as far as other people that are on the master list, nothing should be assumed. I mean, we're going to provide the discovery as soon as we can. And if we interviewed somebody and we intended at the time to call them, we would turn it over, and that's still our position, and that's what we will do. And I think once we get over the 1108, which is a little bit spontaneous because of the way it came up, it should go a little smoother.
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, the difference is very fundamental. We turned -- we had a list of people and we didn't call them all, but we gave discovery on everybody on that list before this trial started, so that if we did call them they could prepare. There were a couple of people -- there were a couple of people who we added to that list during the course of the trial. And I don't mind a couple of people being added. We're talking about hundreds of people here, without us having an ability to even know why they're going to be called or what they're going to say, and they're going to walk in here, and I guarantee you, they're going to dump it on us two or three days before they come in here. If we're lucky.
Mr. Sanger: We promise not to dump it on them.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, I don't want promises. I want compliance. We had compliance dates that you gave us. Why don't they?
Mr. Sanger: Well, I don't know if this is productive. The fact of the matter is, there were a tremendous number of witnesses for which we had no reports. And we were --
Mr. Sneddon: That's not true.
Mr. Sanger: And we filed something in writing demanding the reports and we were told they didn't have them. They had several experts in different categories and they gave us no reports. We couldn't even figure out who they were. Your Honor may recall we filed a motion because they had names down there that weren't even real names of people. They had -- I remember one person, they had two people's names put together, totally different people put together with a hyphen, and we spent forever trying to figure out who that was. So we're beyond that, and we're going to do our best and --
The Court: What I want you to do is to give them the reports on the witnesses that you have as soon as you possibly can.
Mr. Sanger: Yes, sir. That's what we --
The Court: That's what's required.
Mr. Sanger: That's what we intend to do. And with the exception of Orozco, for which I apologize - that was an old declaration - I think we've been doing the best we can. So we'll --
The Court: And I do remember that I gave you some relief. We continued -- you know, we had to put some witnesses off until the next week, or several days, anyway. So if that is happens, you're entitled to the same type of relief.
Mr. Sanger: Do you want to address the character issue, or not?
The Court: Not right now. Now I have them. I haven't read it, so I want time to study what we're dealing with. Are you going to file a response to that?
Mr. Sanger: That's what I was going to say. If the Court would like, or give us permission to do it, we would like to file a response.
The Court: I would, if you'll file that Monday.
Mr. Sanger: Yes, sir.
The Court: Then I think --
Mr. Sanger: Eight o'clock or 8:15 or something?
The Court: Yeah, that's fine. Now we have to have an in-camera hearing on the issue that Mr. Mesereau requested, so I'll need an attorney from each side, the court reporter and the clerk.
Mr. Sneddon: I'll go in.
The Court: And for those present in the courtroom, there won't be any further open court sessions today, so if you want to leave, you may.
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, can Mr. Jackson leave?
The Court: Yes, Mr. Jackson may leave, too.
Adjourn Message: The proceedings adjourned at 1:20 p.m.
