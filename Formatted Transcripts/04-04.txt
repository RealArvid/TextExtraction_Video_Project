Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION Continued BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:
Mr. Auchincloss: Good morning, Mr. Salas.
Jesus Salas: Good morning.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm not sure exactly where I left off, but I'd like to begin by going back to generalities about Neverland. As far as your relationship with Mr. Jackson concerning your employment as house manager, can you characterize the level of control that Mr. Jackson maintained over Neverland and over the main house?
Jesus Salas: I would say pretty high.
Mr. Auchincloss: And as far as in terms of how demanding he could be, could you characterize that as well?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: I can be more specific.
Mr. Auchincloss: How demanding he was about the level of his service that was provided to him by his employers.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who was it that determined what -- which guests -- well, let me back up. How was it determined, if you know, whether a guest would be coming to Neverland or not?
Jesus Salas: I did not know that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And would guests of Neverland be allowed to bring their own guests to Neverland; do you know?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Calls for speculation; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: If you know.
The Court: The objection is overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: I do not know that either.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. The guests of Neverland would be whose guests?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; calls for speculation.
The Court: Foundation is sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if people were allowed on Neverland without Mr. Jackson's permission?
Jesus Salas: I believe that if they weren't allowed by Mr. Jackson, I don't think they would come in.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And do you know who would determine how long a guest was allowed to stay at Neverland?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; calls for speculation.
Mr. Auchincloss: It's a foundational question.
The Court: You may answer that “yes” or “no”.
Jesus Salas: I believe they didn't have no time --
The Court: Just a moment. He's just asking if you have the knowledge. He's not asking you what the knowledge is. Do you know who determined how long a guest could stay? Yes or no.
Jesus Salas: No, I didn't.
Mr. Auchincloss: How were children treated at Neverland?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Can you -- when you were at Neverland, Mr. Salas, when you were house manager, did you observe at any time Mr. Jackson with child guests?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did Mr. Jackson ever inform you of the level of the service he expected of his child guests?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: He was -- he always expected the best, to be treated the best.
Mr. Auchincloss: If a child wanted something at Neverland, had a request, or let's say food, a movie, any special request of that nature, would that request be fulfilled by the employees?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; foundation; calls for speculation.
The Court: Overruled.
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if that's the way Mr. Jackson wanted it?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: How do you know that?
Jesus Salas: Because of what he told me, that -- whatever the guests needed, we needed to provide that for them.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you notice whether or not this level of service or treatment as far as the children went, did you notice if it affected those kids' behavior in any way?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever have a chance to observe the children -- well, let me ask you this: Were the children basically given whatever they wanted?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Salas, please characterize for me, if you would, in general, the level of service and -- well, I think you've said before that the children were allowed the best treatment, the best service, true?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Give me an example. What are you talking about when you say that?
Jesus Salas: Well, the best service I'm talking about, if they wanted to see a movie and have their meal at the theater or any of that kind of stuff, I mean, they -- I would make sure that they would get it that way. Or if they wanted to eat like anywhere else, if they wanted to eat. If guests called me, or the kids called me, they wanted to eat in the train depot, I would make sure that that's where they get their meal, or whatever they asked for.
Mr. Auchincloss: If they wanted candy, were they given candy?
Jesus Salas: Absolutely.
Mr. Auchincloss: If they wanted to play at the amusement park, could they do it?
Jesus Salas: Absolutely.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were there any rules about that?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: As far as when and how they would play?
Jesus Salas: Well, there was some rules, you know, for their safety, you know.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Jesus Salas: Yes. But other than that, there wasn't any other rules.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have golf carts at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were the children allowed to use them?
Jesus Salas: There was some kids that they were allowed to use them.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who decided who got to use the golf carts?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are you aware who allowed the children these privileges of using the golf carts?
Jesus Salas: I had some control on that. We had security or we'd have security there. Many times kids, they were told they weren't allowed to drive certain cars, but they were some kids that they were allowed to drive them.
Mr. Auchincloss: If Mr. Jackson said, “Let this kid drive a golf cart”, would that kid be allowed to drive the golf cart?
Jesus Salas: I would say yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Tell me about the theater at Neverland. Could you describe it for me?
Jesus Salas: Well, it's a full-sized theater with a candy bar, ice cream. It's got pretty much anything that a kid can enjoy.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are there any unusual features as far as where you can watch the movie?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection.
Jesus Salas: Yes, there's an upstairs --
The Court: Just a moment.
Mr. Mesereau: Vague and foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Auchincloss: Go ahead.
Jesus Salas: There's an upstairs room where people can sit up there and watch the movie if they want to.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are there any beds in the theater?
Jesus Salas: Yes, there's two rooms downstairs with two facilities for kids that they can sit in there or lay in bed and watch a movie, if that's what they want.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is the theater ever closed? I mean, does it have hours, I guess is my question? Is it --
Jesus Salas: Pretty much when Mr. Jackson is on the property, we always kept the place open.
Mr. Auchincloss: When he had some what?
Jesus Salas: When Mr. Jackson is on property.
Mr. Auchincloss: I see.
Jesus Salas: We pretty much keep the place open for -- you know, for guests or himself.
Mr. Auchincloss: All night long?
Jesus Salas: All night long.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there one person who made all the main decisions about what happened at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: Well, there is the ranch manager there.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes. And was there one person in charge of the ranch manager?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did that person make all the main decisions at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I believe so.
Mr. Auchincloss: And who was that?
Jesus Salas: That would be Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Now, you spoke a little bit last week about Mr. Jackson's room. Was there -- I believe you testified there was a combination to get in that room?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was that combination ever changed?
Jesus Salas: Not too often, but yes, it did.
Mr. Auchincloss: How often would that combination change?
Jesus Salas: I believe the time that I was there, I think it was about two times that we changed it.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Now, when you say you were there, are you referring to the time -- the full 20 years you were there, or just the year or so that you were house manager?
Jesus Salas: Just when I was the house manager.
Mr. Auchincloss: And was there a combination to get into the main house?
Jesus Salas: Yes, there was.
Mr. Auchincloss: And would that ever change?
Jesus Salas: That one got changed more often.
Mr. Auchincloss: How often, if you could tell us?
Jesus Salas: I would say that we changed that about every two months, somewhere -- somewhere along that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were -- do you know if certain people were given the combinations -- the combination to Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Jesus Salas: Not to my knowledge.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if certain people were given the combination to the Jackson house, the main entry into the home?
Jesus Salas: Yes. Pretty much all his guests have access to the house so they had to have the combination.
Mr. Auchincloss: And who would give them that combination?
Jesus Salas: Myself personal.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. All right. Could we have the “Input 4”, Your Honor?
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Mr. Salas, I show you People's Exhibit No. 20. We've shown this to you before. You've identified it as Frank Tyson. You mentioned that at some point during your employment, Mr. Tyson -- you mentioned something about a problem with Mr. Jackson that Mr. Tyson had. Do you recall that testimony?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: How do you know about that problem?
Jesus Salas: I believe about Mr. Jackson's frustrations.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. You were present when Mr. Jackson expressed some from frustrations?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what was -- can you tell us what he was frustrated about?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll withdraw and reask.
The Court: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. Jackson tell you what he was frustrated about? That's yes or no.
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What -- did Mr. Jackson tell you what was frustrating him?
Jesus Salas: He did not know about Frank bringing people at Neverland Valley without his permission.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Bringing guests without Mr. Jackson's permission?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who was it that informed Mr. Jackson of this issue?
Jesus Salas: I don't know.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And you have previously identified People's Exhibit 35 as the Arvizo family; is that right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: You recall the time when the Arvizo family visited Mr. Jackson in the year 2003?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was this frustration that Mr. Jackson expressed with Mr. Tyson before, or after, or during the time that the Arvizo family was present at Neverland in 2003?
Jesus Salas: That was after the family was there.
Mr. Auchincloss: After the family left?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. I show you People's Exhibit No. 17. You've previously identified this individual as Dieter. Tell me, when was the first time you met Mr. -- Dieter, do you know his last name? Maybe I'll ask you that question first.
Jesus Salas: No, I don't remember his last name.
Mr. Auchincloss: We'll just refer to him as “Dieter”. When was the first time you met Dieter?
Jesus Salas: I believe it was early or mid 2002.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And where did you meet him?
Jesus Salas: I met him at Neverland Valley.
Mr. Auchincloss: Can you tell me about the circumstances? How is it that you met him, under what circumstances?
Jesus Salas: Well, he came to the ranch as a guest, and stayed there for a while. That's how I met him.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So, we're in mid 2002. Dieter comes and visits. Do you know how long he visited for?
Jesus Salas: Not exactly sure, but I believe he stayed there for a couple of weeks the first time he came.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Mr. Jackson there at the time?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Mr. Jackson there before Dieter came on the property, if you recall?
Jesus Salas: I don't remember.
Mr. Auchincloss: When Dieter left the property, do you know if Mr. Jackson left with him?
Jesus Salas: I'm not exactly sure if they did. But there was a few times that they left together.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So Dieter visited the property again after that first time?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: How many times, if you can estimate?
Jesus Salas: Not exactly sure, but he came, I don't know, maybe about three or four times after that. Something like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. And you said that -- some of those times. Do you know how many times Mr. Jackson left with him, when Dieter left?
Jesus Salas: I don't.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know how many times Dieter arrived on the property with Mr. Jackson, if at all?
Jesus Salas: I would say about a couple times.
Mr. Auchincloss: Show you People's Exhibit 18, which you've identified as Ronald. Do you know Ronald's last name?
Jesus Salas: I believe his last name is Konister.
Mr. Auchincloss: Konister?
Jesus Salas: Something like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. We'll refer to him as “Ronald”. How -- when was the first time you met Ronald?
Jesus Salas: It was at the same time I met Dieter.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Dieter come on the property with Ronald in that period, the first visit he came?
Jesus Salas: They both came together.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did they leave together?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when -- did Ronald ever come back to the property after that?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he did.
Mr. Auchincloss: How many times?
Jesus Salas: He came back about -- I believe about another couple times.
Mr. Auchincloss: And during the times that he visited the ranch, did Ronald ever come to the ranch with Mr. Jackson?
Jesus Salas: I believe he came once, if I can recall.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he ever leave the ranch with Mr. Jackson?
Jesus Salas: I -- I'm going to say no on that one.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And while Mr. -- while Ronald was on the property, was -- I think you said the first time Ronald came with Dieter, and they were there the entire time together; is that right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: During those subsequent visits of Ronald, was Dieter on the property?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever see these two men together?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: How often?
Jesus Salas: Daily basis.
Mr. Auchincloss: Daily basis?
Jesus Salas: Uh-huh.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever see these two men with Mr. Jackson?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: How often?
Jesus Salas: Oh, I'm going to say at least they try to have a meeting once a day.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know what Ronald's -- well, let me back up. Do you know what Dieter's relationship was to Mr. Jackson?
Jesus Salas: No, I don't.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if it was -- dealt with friendship, business, or a combination?
Jesus Salas: I would say it was more business.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why do you say that?
Jesus Salas: Because of what they were discussing about business in Europe.
Mr. Auchincloss: You heard them talking about business?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What about Ronald, how would you characterize Ronald's relationship on the same continuum?
Jesus Salas: Same category.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mostly business?
Jesus Salas: Mostly business.
Mr. Auchincloss: During the time that the Arvizo family was on the property, was at Neverland in 2003, did you ever observe Ronald on the property at the same time?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: How about Dieter?
Jesus Salas: The same.
Mr. Auchincloss: And how long were they on the property when the Arvizos were there, if you know, or can estimate?
Jesus Salas: I'd say about two weeks.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is that two weeks total, one continuous time, or two weeks total different times?
Jesus Salas: It was one continuous time.
Mr. Auchincloss: What about Frank, was he on the property during the period of time in 2003 when the Arvizo family was on the property?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he was.
Mr. Auchincloss: And about how much -- same question, about how much time was he on the property when the Arvizos were there?
Jesus Salas: Well, he was living there. He was all the time there.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So whenever the Arvizos were on the ranch, Frank was there?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you ever heard of an individual by the name of Malnik? Malnik?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was he a visitor? Was that a man?
Jesus Salas: Yes, it's a man.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you meet him?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was he ever a visitor at the ranch?
Jesus Salas: At the time that I was there he only came once, I believe.
Mr. Auchincloss: For how long?
Jesus Salas: I don't know. A couple weeks.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was that time that Mr. Malnik visited the ranch, did that coincide with any time that the Arvizos were there?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm showing you People's Exhibit 3. You didn't know this individual's name last week. But you did recognize him. Was this individual on the ranch at any time during the period that the Arvizos were at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: I don't believe he was there around that time.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Do you remember if he was there -- you did testify that he had been at Neverland before?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was he there before or after the Arvizos were there, if you recall?
Jesus Salas: I don't recall. He was there before.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Do you know an individual by the name of Zia?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who is Zia?
Jesus Salas: My understanding, he is a lawyer.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you met him?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where did you meet him?
Jesus Salas: At the ranch.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know who he works for?
Jesus Salas: Not exactly. My understanding, he was working for Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Zia -- well, let me back up. How many times did Zia visit Neverland where you saw him there?
Jesus Salas: I saw him there a couple of times.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did -- any of the time that Zia was on Neverland, did that coincide with any of the time that the Arvizos were there in 2003?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever see Zia during that period of time when he was visiting the ranch in 2003 talking with Mr. Jackson?
Jesus Salas: I believe, yes, they did have a meeting one time.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Let's talk a little bit about the Arvizos, okay? In 2003, what members of the Arvizo family were visiting Neverland?
Jesus Salas: It was just the kids and the mother.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So the three children, Davellin, Star, Gavin, and the mother?
Jesus Salas: And the mother.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know her name?
Jesus Salas: Janet.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you participate in bringing them to Neverland in any fashion on that visit, first visit, in 2003 I'm talking about?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I picked them up at Santa Barbara Airport.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And was Mr. Jackson with them at that time?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you drove to Neverland Ranch?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Now, you testified that you would stay very late pursuant to your employment at Neverland.
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you'd arrive pretty early, around 7:00, I think you said?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you in a position to see who spent the night in Mr. Jackson's room?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I was aware of who was sleeping there.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And during the time that the Arvizo boys, or let's say the Arvizo children, were at Neverland Ranch, can you tell me where the two boys would sleep?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague as to time.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm talking about the period in 2003. The visit in 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: I repeat the objection. It's vague.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: In 2003, you said that you brought the Arvizo family to Neverland. How long did they stay on that -- on that particular visit?
Jesus Salas: Not exactly sure how long they stayed. But I would say they stayed a week or two, something like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did they -- they then left the ranch for a period of time?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: How long did they leave the ranch for, about, before they came back?
Jesus Salas: I would say about another two weeks.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Jesus Salas: Something like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: And then when they came back to the ranch, how long did they stay?
Jesus Salas: That time, I believe they stayed about another, I would say, two weeks, three weeks. Somewhere around there.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. When they left that time, did they return to the ranch?
Jesus Salas: Yes, they came once again.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And how long did they stay the third time?
Jesus Salas: About another week.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. When they left the third time, how long -- did they ever return to the ranch?
Jesus Salas: That was the last time I saw them.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Now, this period of these visits that you've just described, of visiting the ranch, leaving, visiting, leaving, visiting, and visiting one third time, over what period of time did all of these visits take, if you can estimate in terms of weeks, months? How many weeks or months did it take for all of these visits to take place?
Jesus Salas: I would say about five weeks, something like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Now, tell me how detailed your recollections are about exact dates and exact periods of time concerning this, the visits by the Arvizos.
Jesus Salas: I -- I don't remember the dates, okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Jesus Salas: It's just --
Mr. Auchincloss: Are you giving us your best estimates?
Jesus Salas: That is the best.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are you -- but are you exactly sure about the time periods and the amount of time?
Jesus Salas: I'm pretty sure about the time of them being there. But not exact --
Mr. Auchincloss: When you say “the time”, do you mean the dates, or the amount of time?
Jesus Salas: The amount of time.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So during this period of time that -- these three visits that you talked about that the Arvizos visited Neverland, was Mr. Jackson there during that period of time?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if he was there the entire time or if he had periods where he was gone?
Jesus Salas: I would say that he was there most of the time. Pretty much all the time.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Are you sure whether or not he -- do you have a specific recollection of whether he left or not and came back; do you know?
Jesus Salas: I don't.
Mr. Auchincloss: During the time -- these three visits -- during that period of time in which Mr. Jackson was on the property, on Neverland - okay? - can you tell me where the Arvizo boys slept?
Mr. Mesereau: Again, vague as to time. Vague as to what visit. Vague as to what portion of the visit.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: I can tighten that up.
Mr. Auchincloss: Let's do them one at a time, okay? We'll do the first one. During the first visit in 2003 of the Arvizo family, during the period of time that Mr. Jackson was on the property, can you tell me where the Arvizo boys slept?
Jesus Salas: There was times that they slept in the guesthouse. Okay. There were times that they sleep with -- with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And during the time that -- during this second visit when they left and came back, can you tell me, during that second visit, where did the Arvizo boys sleep?
Jesus Salas: That would be about the same. They sleep with Mr. Jackson. Most of the time I believe that they were trying to sleep with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: And same question for the third visit.
Jesus Salas: And that's going to be the same answer.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Now, you said that they had a guest room.
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did -- let me ask you, first of all, while you were manager, house manager, did you notice if any other children slept in Mr. Jackson's room, other than the Arvizos?
Jesus Salas: There was some other kids.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was it unusual for a kid who was sleeping in Mr. Jackson's room to also have a guest room?
Jesus Salas: No, not really.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you see Mr. Jackson interact with these children who spent the night in his room?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
Mr. Auchincloss: Foundational question.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: He would spend time, because he would play with them.
Mr. Auchincloss: And while -- and I'm just talking about the year that you were house manager. While you were house manager, how often would he play with these children?
Jesus Salas: I would say anytime that he had some spare time he would play with the kids.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Would it be -- you tell me. Would it be daily?
Jesus Salas: He would try to be with them daily.
Mr. Auchincloss: As far as the children visiting the ranch, did you notice whether or not Mr. Jackson formed -- appeared to form any special bonds with certain children?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Over the period of time, and I'm talking just about the time that you were manager of the ranch, you mentioned that you would see the children play with Mr. Jackson, true?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where would you see them play?
Jesus Salas: Well, they would go to the park. They would go for a walk. They would go bike riding. Or they have quads, and they would ride the quads everywhere.
Mr. Auchincloss: Quads, what -- what are quads?
Jesus Salas: The four-wheelers.
Mr. Auchincloss: Those are motorized vehicles?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you see them in the house?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you see them having meals together?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would you see this on a daily basis?
Jesus Salas: Pretty much.
Mr. Auchincloss: So over that period of time, did you notice whether or not he formed any special bonds with certain children?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague and foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: These children who spent the night in Mr. Jackson's room, did they share any common characteristics?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: Go ahead and ask me the question again.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. The question is, the children that spent the night in Mr. Jackson's room that you've talked about, did they share anything in common, any common characteristics?
Mr. Mesereau: Vague; foundation. Objection.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did they have anything in common? Sorry.
The Court: All right. Objection sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if these children, whether or not -- did you notice the age of these children?
Jesus Salas: They were around 10, 11. Around that age.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you notice what gender they were?
Jesus Salas: No, I don't.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you notice whether they were boys or girls?
Jesus Salas: Well, yes, they were mostly boys.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever see anyone else sleep in Mr. Jackson's room other than these children?
Jesus Salas: Pretty much it was just the boys. That's about it.
Mr. Auchincloss: You previously testified that there was alcohol on Neverland, true?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And I think you said you were somewhat responsible for stocking the alcohol at Neverland as house manager?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Mr. Jackson drink?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Are you aware of what his drinks of choice were, what he liked to drink, in terms of alcohol?
Jesus Salas: Well, he drink wine and vodka also.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Where was the wine stored on the property?
Jesus Salas: Most of the wine, it was in the wine cellar. We also have wine in the house.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where in the house?
Jesus Salas: In the refrigerators.
Mr. Auchincloss: In the kitchen area?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Auchincloss: And the vodka, where was that kept?
Jesus Salas: In the kitchen.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Was there any -- was it any secret at Neverland that Mr. Jackson drank alcoholic beverages?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; calls for speculation; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Salas, were you ever told by anybody that Mr. Jackson's drinking was to be concealed from anybody?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: On which basis, Your Honor?
The Court: Hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you see Mr. Jackson drinking at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: I never saw him drinking.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you ever seen him exhibiting the effects of drinking?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: On how many occasions?
Jesus Salas: Well, lately it was on a pretty much regular basis.
Mr. Auchincloss: A regular basis?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever see Mr. Jackson where he appeared to have been drinking a great deal, that he appeared to be drunk?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever see him appear to be drunk -- well, let me ask you this: Was there ever any effort that you saw to conceal this fact that Mr. Jackson had been drinking, that he was drunk, to conceal that fact from his children?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; leading; foundation.
The Court: Foundation; sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Salas, when you saw Mr. Jackson when he was drunk, did you ever see him in the presence -- in that condition, in the presence of his children?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: On more than one occasion?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Can you tell me how many or approximate?
Jesus Salas: Well, I couldn't tell you exactly how many times, but it was quite a few times.
Mr. Auchincloss: During that period of time -- and tell me -- let's get time specific here. What time frame are we talking about? Is this when you were house manager?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: During that period of time did you ever see Mr. Jackson make any effort to conceal his condition from his children?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; foundation; calls for speculation.
The Court: I'm going to allow an answer to that question, but again, it's a foundational question. So it can only be answered “yes” or “no”. I'll have the court reporter read it back to you. We're asking do you have this knowledge.
The Court Reporter: During that period of time did you ever see Mr. Jackson make any effort to conceal his condition from his children?
Jesus Salas: Can you ask me the question a different way?
Mr. Auchincloss: Sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: My question is, during the period of time when you saw Mr. Jackson when he was drunk in the presence of his children, did Mr. Jackson do anything to hide the fact that he had been drinking or that he was drunk when that occurred, when you saw that?
Mr. Mesereau: Same objection.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: Not to my knowledge.
Mr. Auchincloss: You said that wine is stored in the wine cellar. Is there any hard liquor that's ever kept in the wine cellar?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What kind of hard liquor?
Jesus Salas: There's some whiskey, I believe. Some tequila. Pretty much that's it.
Mr. Auchincloss: And was there whiskey and tequila in the wine cellar during the time that the Arvizo children were there in 2003?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever see kids go into the wine cellar, any kids, during your period of time as house manager?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you ever see the Arvizo kids go into the wine cellar?
Jesus Salas: I never saw them down in the wine cellar.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever see them come out of the wine cellar?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you ever have any reports, as house manager, that the Arvizo children were in the wine cellar?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: Not specifically the Arvizo kids.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Have you ever served wine or any alcoholic beverage to Mr. Jackson when he was in the presence of children?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: On more than one occasion?
Jesus Salas: I would say that was a couple times.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you remember any of the children that were with him when you served him alcoholic beverages, or wine, let's say?
Jesus Salas: I'm not exactly what kids were in there, but I know the Arvizos were there, the kids, and some other kids that were there as well.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Now, tell me, was there a time when you brought him some wine and four glasses?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Tell me -- you said there was a couple of times that you brought Mr. Jackson wine in the presence of children. Tell me about the first one you remember. When was it?
Jesus Salas: It was at nighttime.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you remember when it was in terms of the year that you served as house manager, approximately?
Jesus Salas: Well, it was -- I would say it was January somewhere. January, somewhere around there.
Mr. Auchincloss: Of 2002, 2003?
Jesus Salas: 2003.
Mr. Auchincloss: And about what time of night?
Jesus Salas: It was about -- I would say it was about nine o'clock.
Mr. Auchincloss: And where did you go, what room?
Jesus Salas: I went to Mr. Jackson's bedroom, upstairs.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did you bring to Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Jesus Salas: I brought some glasses, and some wine.
Mr. Auchincloss: What type of wine; do you remember?
Jesus Salas: I don't remember the type of wine.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you remember whether it was red or white?
Jesus Salas: I want to say that it was a white wine.
Mr. Auchincloss: What type of glasses did you bring?
Jesus Salas: Glass -- it was just glass wines.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm sorry?
Jesus Salas: Glass wines.
Mr. Auchincloss: Wine glass?
Jesus Salas: No, let me back up. It was just glasses, normal glasses.
Mr. Auchincloss: Normal glasses?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were they tall glasses or short glasses?
Jesus Salas: Short glasses.
Mr. Auchincloss: Can you describe them?
Jesus Salas: Short glasses.
Mr. Auchincloss: And who ordered this wine?
Jesus Salas: Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you talk to him personally?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did he tell you?
Jesus Salas: He called me and asked me to bring some glasses to his room and some wine.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he tell you how many glasses?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: How many?
Jesus Salas: Four of them.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. So you brought the -- and did you do as he ordered you to do?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when you delivered this wine, did you deliver it to his bedroom?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you deliver it to the lower portion of his bedroom or the upstairs portion?
Jesus Salas: Just to the lower portion.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Mr. Jackson or any of the children present when you delivered this wine?
Jesus Salas: Yes, there were.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who was present?
Jesus Salas: The kids that were there. Gavin, and I believe it was also Frank's brothers, the ones that were there. But let me tell you something else. He also ordered some sodas with that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So what do you mean, “some sodas”?
Jesus Salas: He also asked me to bring some sodas with that order.
Mr. Auchincloss: Tell me what you mean by “sodas”.
Jesus Salas: Yes, just the normal soda cans.
Mr. Auchincloss: Soda drinks?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Now, you have previously talked to the sheriffs about this incident, haven't you?
Jesus Salas: Right. Right.
Mr. Auchincloss: And described for them that you brought a bottle of wine and glasses?
Jesus Salas: Uh-huh.
Mr. Auchincloss: Let me back up. Let me back up. So you brought some wine and glasses, and some sodas?
Jesus Salas: Uh-huh.
Mr. Auchincloss: Let's move on to the second incident first, okay? Tell me about the second incident. When did that occur?
Jesus Salas: That was -- it was also -- it was also nighttime.
Mr. Auchincloss: Nighttime?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Auchincloss: About what time?
Jesus Salas: That time it was about around eleven o'clock. Somewhere around 11:00.
Mr. Auchincloss: And was this before or after the incident that you just described?
Jesus Salas: That was after.
Mr. Auchincloss: And who placed the order on this occasion?
Jesus Salas: Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did he order?
Jesus Salas: Some more wine.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did he also ask for glasses?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: How many glasses?
Jesus Salas: This time I believe it was just one glass. It was just for him.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And who was present when that -- when you delivered that wine?
Jesus Salas: I'm not exactly sure who was there, but I believe this time it was himself at night.
Mr. Auchincloss: But I'm talking about -- you said there were two times that children were present when you served him. I'm talking about the second time that children were present.
Jesus Salas: Yeah, that time I'm not exactly who was there, how many of the kids were there.
Mr. Auchincloss: You're not sure?
Jesus Salas: No, I'm not sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Now, let's go back to this time -- this first incident where you said that you served wine and soda. You have been interviewed about this by the sheriff's department, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you were interviewed back in, I believe it was, 2003; is that right?
Jesus Salas: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when you talked to the sheriff's department about this, you never mentioned anything about any soda?
Jesus Salas: No, I didn't.
Mr. Auchincloss: And why is that?
Jesus Salas: I don't know. It just -- it just flip out right now to my mind.
Mr. Auchincloss: You just remembered it just this second?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you said that you came back and the bottle of wine was empty?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there any other liquor you brought?
Jesus Salas: No, that was the second time --
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm talking about the first time.
Jesus Salas: No, that was it.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when you came back, was the bottle empty?
Jesus Salas: Yes, it was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. The wine cellar. You said you didn't ever have any complaints of -- hear of any complaints regarding the Arvizos. Did you ever have any other complaints of any other children in the wine cellar?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And do you know which children they were?
Jesus Salas: When I was given those complaints, it was about the kids from Los Olivos.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. If I could have the Elmo again, Your Honor, please.
Mr. Auchincloss: Showing you People's Exhibit 45. Is that one of the kids you're talking about?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: 46?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: That's one of the kids?
Jesus Salas: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And 47.
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Are there any other kids that you're referring to, or is that everybody that we're talking about?
Jesus Salas: No, I did get some other complaints about some other kids which wasn't these kids.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Now, these three kids that -- I think you've identified them as being from Los Olivos previously, correct?
Jesus Salas: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: We'll call them “the Los Olivos boys”, okay?
Jesus Salas: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Now, the Los Olivos boys, you said you had a complaint, complaints regarding them in the wine cellar. What was the nature of the complaint?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: It's offered to explain conduct.
The Court: Whose conduct?
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Salas's. And I can tell you at sidebar where I'm going, if you like.
The Court: The objection is sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you personally ever see the Los Olivos boys in the wine cellar?
Jesus Salas: Not in the wine cellar, but I saw them come out.
Mr. Auchincloss: You saw them coming out of the wine cellar. And when you saw them coming out of the wine cellar, what time of day are we talking about?
Jesus Salas: Early in the morning, around eight o'clock in the morning.
Mr. Auchincloss: And during that previous -- let's say the ten hours -- well, let's see, let me back up. Do you know if Mr. Jackson was in the wine cellar with them?
Jesus Salas: That early morning, or late night, early morning, Mr. Jackson was with the kids.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when you saw these kids come out of the wine cellar, did you notice whether or not they exhibited any signs of being intoxicated?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Tell me what you saw.
Jesus Salas: When I saw the boys coming out of the arcade, which is where the wine cellar is, the kids weren't acting normal. So I approached one of them, and I said, “Are you okay?” That's when I noticed that the kids were drunk.
Mr. Auchincloss: How drunk were they, if you could characterize it?
Jesus Salas: I would say that they were -- what would you call it? I mean, you can tell that they were drunk. I mean, I could see that they had been drinking.
Mr. Auchincloss: What were they doing that made you believe they'd been drinking?
Jesus Salas: The way they were acting. I mean, they weren't just normal. Something was wrong with the kids.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you notice any other times when these three boys had been drinking, and it was apparent to you that they had been drinking?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; relevance; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: Your question was what date?
Mr. Auchincloss: No, my question -- you've told us about one incident where you noticed the three Los Olivos boys had been drinking. I want to know if you ever observed a second time that these same boys had been drinking.
Jesus Salas: Yes, there was a second time.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when was that?
Jesus Salas: I want to say it was -- it was after that one. Not exactly sure, you know, how many weeks after that. But I would say it was two, three weeks after that one.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when was the first time, approximately?
Jesus Salas: I want to say it was in October when I saw those kids the first time.
Mr. Auchincloss: 2002? 2003? You tell me.
Jesus Salas: It was 2002, I believe.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And where did you see these boys the second time when they appeared to have been drinking?
Jesus Salas: At the house.
Mr. Auchincloss: Inside the house?
Jesus Salas: Yes. Well, they were everywhere, but, yes, they were in the house.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Mr. Jackson on the property at that time?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Had these boys been spending any time with Mr. Jackson that day?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Had you observed whether or not Mr. Jackson had spent any time with these boys earlier that day?
Jesus Salas: I don't believe that day he spent time with them. They were alone.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you see the boys all -- during the entire time they were on the property?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: You were with them the entire time?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: So do you know whether or not they spent time with Mr. Jackson for certain?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; foundation.
The Court: Argumentative; sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So what portion of that day did you spend actually observing the boys? Let me back up. Let me back up. How long were these boys on the property that particular day?
Jesus Salas: They were there till twelve o'clock, one o'clock.
Mr. Auchincloss: At night?
Jesus Salas: Uh-huh.
Mr. Auchincloss: Or one o'clock in the morning, I guess?
Jesus Salas: One o'clock in the morning, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when did they arrive?
Jesus Salas: They arrived around noontime.
Mr. Auchincloss: And how much of that time -- so that's about 12 hours, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Auchincloss: How many of those hours were they in a place that you could see them, where you were actually seeing them?
Jesus Salas: Well, they were back and forth, and they were everywhere, so I really didn't have a control of watching them or any of that stuff.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Jesus Salas: But they were back and forth in the house, back at the park, different places.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know where they got their alcohol?
Jesus Salas: No, I don't.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you responsible for cleaning the wine cellar?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you observe any other incidents where Mr. Jackson was in the wine cellar with children? I mean, did that happen on other occasions? And I'm confining this just to the time you were house manager.
Jesus Salas: No, I don't.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know? You don't recall any other times?
Jesus Salas: Not that I can remember.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Now, during the time that you were house manager, did you ever observe any adult magazines in Mr. Jackson's private quarters?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did these magazines feature nudity?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And where were these -- which room were these magazines in?
Jesus Salas: They were on the first floor on the left side in one of the bathrooms.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were those magazines there in that bathroom during the time that the Arvizos were at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Madam Clerk, may I double-check with you? I have three items I'm marking. I want to double-check and make sure these numbers haven't been used. 777, 778, and 779.
The Clerk: No, they haven't.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Thank you. May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Salas, I show you People's Exhibit 777. Can you identify that for me, please?
Jesus Salas: Yes. These are some statues that were in Mr. Jackson's office.
Mr. Auchincloss: I show you People's Exhibit 778. Would you please identify that for me?
Jesus Salas: Yes, they were also in his office.
Mr. Auchincloss: And People's Exhibit 779?
Jesus Salas: Yes. That is correct. They were in his office.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Thank you. Can you tell me where these statues were located?
Jesus Salas: They were located in Mr. Jackson's office. They were placed on different stands.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were they on display?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Over what period of time are we talking about?
Jesus Salas: Well, they have been there a long time.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were they there the entire time you were house manager?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were they there during the time that the Arvizos were present on the property?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were they there -- did Mr. Jackson's children ever visit that office?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Your Honor, I'd like to offer into evidence People's Exhibit 777, 778 and 779 at this time.
Mr. Mesereau: No objection.
The Court: It's admitted. All three.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. If I may publish these, Your Honor.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Showing you People's Exhibit 777, is that an accurate depiction of one of the dolls that you saw in Mr. Jackson's office?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Or statues. Whatever they are. 778, there are two photographs there. Do those photographs accurately depict the dolls that were present during the period of time that you were house manager in Mr. Jackson's office?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And 779; same questions. Were those -- are those accurate depictions of what you observed in Mr. Jackson's office during the time that you were house manager?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Going back to the period of time when the Arvizos were on the property, was there -- and I want to talk about the first visit, the first visit in 2003, after you picked up the Arvizos from the airport. You previously testified that they were at Neverland for a period of approximately two weeks. Mr. Salas, during that period of time did you observe the Arvizo family to be restricted in any way?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: In what way were they restricted?
Jesus Salas: I believe they weren't allowed to leave Neverland Valley Ranch.
Mr. Auchincloss: And why do you say that?
Jesus Salas: Because I had a talk to the mother and she's the one that told me.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection, that's hearsay. Move to strike.
Mr. Auchincloss: Goes to state of mind. Also offered to explain this witness's conduct later.
The Court: I will admit it for the limited purpose of explaining the conduct of Jesus. It's not to be used for the truth of the matter asserted by Janet.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: So at some point, did you personally help the Arvizo family to get out of Neverland?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: How did you do that?
Jesus Salas: I took them down to L.A.
Mr. Auchincloss: You drove them personally?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you take -- use -- I take it you used one of Mr. Jackson's cars?
Jesus Salas: That is correct. I got a phone call from her, and she wanted to talk to me about something.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: It's offered for the same purpose.
The Court: It's nonresponsive. Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: So tell me what precipitated your conduct of helping the Arvizos by taking them off the property. What happened? What was it that made you do that?
Jesus Salas: Like I said, she called me at my office and wanted to talk to me. So I came over, and I thought it was something that I needed to take care of, you know, in the room. And she asked me to --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection, hearsay, Your Honor.
The Court: I'll admit it for the limited purpose again to explain what he's doing, not for the truth of the matter that she asserted.
Jesus Salas: So she asked me -- she told me if I can drive them down to L.A., that she wanted to leave the property. So I ask her, you know, “What's the reason? Why do you want to leave the property?” She was very --
Mr. Mesereau: Same objection.
The Court: Sustained after he started on another subject.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Can you tell me what her emotional state was at the time?
Jesus Salas: She was very upset.
Mr. Auchincloss: How was she demonstrating that she was upset?
Jesus Salas: Crying.
Mr. Auchincloss: What time of -- what time of the day or evening are we talking about here when this happened?
Jesus Salas: We're talking about nighttime.
Mr. Auchincloss: Nighttime?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did she express any -- did she express any fear while you were talking to her?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you were talking to her, did she appear to be fearful of something?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Tell me about any other emotional -- expressions of emotion that she had, if you noticed any.
Jesus Salas: Well, she looks very preoccupied. She was just -- she wasn't comfortable there. She just wanted to leave the property.
The Court: All right. Let's take our break.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Go ahead, Counsel.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: Before I continue where I left off with the Arvizos, Mr. Salas, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about -- one involving the wine cellar. At some time during your occupation as the house manager, was there a safe that was put in to keep some of the keys to various places, including the wine cellar?
Jesus Salas: Yes, there was.
Mr. Auchincloss: And where was that safe put in?
Jesus Salas: It was in the -- inside the house in what we call the maids' room.
Mr. Auchincloss: When was that safe put in?
Jesus Salas: It was during the time that we noticed the kids were having access to alcohol.
Mr. Auchincloss: The Los Olivos boys?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And can you help me out with the time frame in terms of what we're -- 2002 or 2003?
Jesus Salas: 2003.
Mr. Auchincloss: 2003?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: You said that it was October of 2002 when the problem occurred with the Los Olivos boys.
Jesus Salas: Yes, but we didn't took action until after that. It took us a while to put the key away.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you previously told detectives that it was in the -- it was around December of 2002 that the safe was put in?
Jesus Salas: I must have said that. I mean, I could be wrong.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you have a clear recollection of exactly when the safe went in?
Jesus Salas: I don't know.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you recall that the safe was there when the Arvizos were there?
Jesus Salas: Yes, it was in, the safe.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. And the wine cellar key, was it kept in that safe?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. So when you took the Arvizos from Neverland, what car did you use?
Jesus Salas: I used the Rolls Royce.
Mr. Auchincloss: And who was it that decided to use that particular car? Whose decision was that?
Jesus Salas: It was my decision.
Mr. Auchincloss: Had you previously done some driving for Mr. Jackson? I know you previously testified you did the limo drive to Neverland. But other than that, had you previously done some driving for Mr. Jackson?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you previously use that car on occasion?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you tell anybody that you were taking the Jacksons -- or did you tell anybody that you were taking the Arvizos off property?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who did you tell?
Jesus Salas: I told Mr. Jackson's bodyguard, Chris Carter.
Mr. Auchincloss: And why did you tell Chris?
Jesus Salas: Because it was not my decision to make to take the family off the property without telling somebody.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Was Dieter on the property at the time?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Ronald on the property at the time?
Jesus Salas: No, he wasn't.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Frank on the property at the time?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he was.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there a reason you didn't tell Dieter or Frank that you were taking them off the property?
Jesus Salas: It was late, and the reason I didn't told them, it was because I didn't know who to tell, so I told Chris about the situation.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Jesus Salas: And so --
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Miss Arvizo express to you, during that period of time, that she was fearful of anything?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Miss Arvizo express concern to you over any particular individuals at Neverland?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Jesus Salas: Yes, she did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who was she concerned about?
Jesus Salas: It was Dieter and Ronald.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was she concerned about Frank at all?
Jesus Salas: She didn't really say too much about Frank.
Mr. Auchincloss: So you drive her off the property. Where did you take her and her children?
Jesus Salas: Down south, L.A.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you take her to a residence?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was it a house or an apartment?
Jesus Salas: It was a house.
Mr. Auchincloss: And was it the place -- did she direct you to the location where she wanted to go?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you get in any trouble for taking the Arvizos off the property?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Tell me about that.
Jesus Salas: Well, the next day, I was told that they weren't supposed to leave the property.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: I can ask a couple of other questions that will tighten it up, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. I'll strike the answer.
Mr. Auchincloss: And this answer will be offered in furtherance.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who told you you were in trouble?
Jesus Salas: The first person that told me, it was Frank.
Mr. Auchincloss: Frank Tyson?
Jesus Salas: Uh-huh.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what did Frank tell you?
Jesus Salas: He told me not -- that they weren't supposed to leave the property. They were supposed to be notified first.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who was supposed to be notified first?
Jesus Salas: Him.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he tell you how to handle yourself in the future?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll rephrase.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he make any remarks to you concerning the future?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he did.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did he say?
Jesus Salas: Not to make -- I mean, if it was a second time, not to do that anymore.
Mr. Auchincloss: Not to let the Arvizos off the property if they come back?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Move to strike.
The Court: Stricken.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did anybody else tell you that you did the wrong thing?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who was that?
Jesus Salas: Dieter.
Mr. Auchincloss: What did Dieter tell you?
Jesus Salas: Same thing.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Same purpose.
The Court: Overruled. It's admitted for the limited purpose under the conspiracy instruction that I talked to you about earlier. Go ahead.
Mr. Auchincloss: Tell us what Dieter told you.
Jesus Salas: He told me the same thing; that next time I should tell them about the situation first.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did the Arvizos -- well, let me back up. When Miss Arvizo was talking to you about her desire to leave the ranch, did you speak English with her?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever speak with her in a different language?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Are you fluent in Spanish?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I am.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if she is?
Jesus Salas: No, I don't.
Mr. Auchincloss: Around -- well, let's talk about when they returned to the property. You said a short time after the first -- they first left Neverland, the Arvizos returned.
Jesus Salas: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were you there when that happened?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when they returned to the property, did Mrs. Arvizo ever ask you to transport her off the property on that occasion, on the second visit?
Jesus Salas: Yes, she --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Also offered to explain conduct.
The Court: The objection is overruled. And I'll admit it for the limited purpose of explaining his behavior. Go ahead.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was your answer?
Jesus Salas: Yes. Yes, I was.
Mr. Auchincloss: And when did she make that request of you, in relationship to the time that she arrived?
Jesus Salas: I would say it was -- it was about a week when she asked me again.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you take her off the property that time?
Jesus Salas: No, I didn't.
Mr. Auchincloss: Why not?
Jesus Salas: Because I was told not to do that anymore.
Mr. Auchincloss: Now, at some point the Arvizos left Neverland --
Jesus Salas: Yes, they did.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- for the final time. Have you ever seen them since that time?
Jesus Salas: That was the last time I saw them.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you recall when you were first interviewed about the general facts that you've just described for us by law enforcement?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And was there anything special about that particular day when you first spoke to law enforcement?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: When you said about special, what do you mean?
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there anything unusual that happened on that date --
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- that you're aware of?
Jesus Salas: Yes, it was.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was it?
Jesus Salas: That was when the police came over to Mr. Jackson's house.
Mr. Auchincloss: The day of the search warrant?
Jesus Salas: The day of the search, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you remember what month that was?
Jesus Salas: It was November.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So you told the police about this, helping the Arvizos, on the same day as the search warrant was issued, or executed, I should say; is that accurate?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you, Mr. Salas. I have no further questions.
The Court: Okay. Cross-examine?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please, Your Honor.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Good morning.
Jesus Salas: Good morning.
Mr. Mesereau: Is it Mr. Salas or Salazar?
Jesus Salas: Salas.
Mr. Mesereau: Salas, okay. My name is Tom Mesereau and I speak for Michael Jackson, okay? We haven't spoken before, right?
Jesus Salas: I believe we have. Didn't you call me one time or something like that?
Mr. Mesereau: I didn't. That was an investigator.
Jesus Salas: It wasn't you.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You spoke to one of our investigators named Jesus Castillo, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you spoke to him around January 9th, 2005, right?
Jesus Salas: Must have been, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. And do you know -- where did that interview take place; do you know?
Jesus Salas: Yes. Was it the Holiday Inn, Santa Maria?
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And approximately how long do you remember speaking with our investigator, Jesus Castillo?
Jesus Salas: It took, I would say, about half an hour.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And do you remember you told Mr. Castillo that when you told the police that you remembered Gavin and Star sleeping in Mr. Jackson's room, you meant the lower portion of the two-level suite, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Mr. Castillo that Mr. Jackson's room has an upstairs portion and a downstairs, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told him that you never saw Gavin or Star sleeping in Mr. Jackson's bed located upstairs, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll object; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: That is correct. I never saw them sleeping in the bed. I saw them out of bed, not sleeping.
Mr. Mesereau: Right. The only place you ever saw Gavin or Star sleeping was in the downstairs portion of Mr. Jackson's room, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you remember many guests of Mr. Jackson sleeping in his room, sometimes upstairs and sometimes downstairs, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, if you're talking about the boys, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Yeah. He had guests come and sleep from time to time --
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: -- in that suite, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Sometimes you'd see them upstairs, sometimes you'd see them downstairs, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, one time you suspected that Gavin might have been drinking at a dinner table, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: But you never saw Gavin drinking, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And his family used to have dinner at the dinner table, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: His mother used to have dinner at the dinner table, correct?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you questions about whether or not children have a lot of freedom at Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And your answer was basically they do, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And so do their parents have freedom at Neverland, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you about something along the lines of first-class service. Do you remember that?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said that Mr. Jackson liked to have his guests get high-quality service, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: But when you said that, you were also including adult guests, correct?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you were there and you saw Janet Arvizo there, she was getting first-class service, true?
Jesus Salas: Yes, she was.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember a period of time when Janet Arvizo was there with her former husband, David Arvizo? Do you remember that?
Jesus Salas: One time, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And they both were entitled to first-class service, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And when Janet came with just her children, she had all the privileges that guests get at Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: She was able to enter the main residence, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: She was able to order food when she wanted, correct?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: She could sit at the dinner table at the main house and have dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: She also was allowed to enter the kitchen and sit at that bar area and order breakfast when she chose, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: She also ordered room service when she wanted, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know which quarters she stayed in?
Jesus Salas: If I remember, it was on Unit 4.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's one of the most beautiful rooms on that property, isn't it?
Jesus Salas: Yes, it is.
Mr. Mesereau: It's a room where Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando request to stay, or used to request to stay from time to time, correct?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; relevancy.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Janet was entitled to the same service that guests like Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando would get, correct?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; relevancy.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: Right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you told the jury that the theater would be open day and night, adult guests also were allowed to go into the theater day or night, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you told the prosecutor that there was some rooms in the theater with beds in them, adults could use those rooms, true?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor talked about candy and sodas and food being available at all hours of date. They were also available for adult guests, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And isn't it true that Mr. Jackson wanted his adult guests to have special, classy service, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you saw kids at Neverland visiting when Mr. Jackson wasn't there, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And typically, if kids visited Neverland when Mr. Jackson wasn't there, there were rules that were supposed to be followed for safety, as you said, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And typically, it was their parents or whatever adults were with them that appeared to be in charge of them, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you saw busloads of children from various locations visit Neverland from time to time, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And to your knowledge, Mr. Jackson wasn't in charge of all of those busloads of children, was he?
Jesus Salas: No, he wasn't.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, most of the time when lots of kids would visit Neverland, some other adult appeared to be in charge of those kids, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And adults and children would visit Neverland and be given tours of Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Who typically would give those tours?
Jesus Salas: We assigned different people, employees of Neverland Valley.
Mr. Mesereau: And tell the jury how a tour would be conducted when children and adults would visit Neverland.
Jesus Salas: They were --
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Relevancy; beyond the scope.
The Court: Overruled. Go ahead.
Jesus Salas: They would arrive at Neverland Valley Ranch, park on the outside parking lot, walk to the train station. And from there, they were picked up either by train or walk, whatever they preferred to do, okay, take them back to the theater. Enjoy, you know, the petting zoo. They were allowed to visit where they wanted to. I mean, we had a schedule for them and took them everywhere, the property, to show them the place and enjoy the place. And they ended up at the theater and at the park.
Mr. Mesereau: And you would schedule lots of tours from time to time, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Sometimes you'd have a couple of hundred children visiting with adults, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct. Sometimes more than that.
Mr. Mesereau: What's the largest number of kids you remember visiting at one time to Neverland?
Jesus Salas: I would say about 300, 300 kids.
Mr. Mesereau: And did they come with adults who were in charge of them?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did you arrange tours for these children as well?
Jesus Salas: Yes. We assigned the personnel to give them a tour, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And sometimes, if Michael Jackson was on the premises, he would come out and say hello, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: But he never was in charge of what these kids did, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; vague as to “kids”.
The Court: Overruled. The answer's in. Next question.
Mr. Mesereau: Who would prepare the schedule to indicate whether children were coming to Neverland on a particular day?
Jesus Salas: I believe that came from L.A. office.
Mr. Mesereau: And would it be posted somewhere?
Jesus Salas: Yes. All Neverland personnel got a schedule of the kids coming to Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: And would you get a schedule typically the day before or that morning?
Jesus Salas: Normally we got it, like, two days before, a day before, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And as part of your work, you had to look at the future schedule every day, didn't you?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Because almost every day something unusual or special would be going on at Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And how long did you work at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: The total was 20 years.
Mr. Mesereau: During that 20-year period, would it be accurate to say that many, many thousands of children came through, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: They came from Los Angeles, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: They came from Santa Barbara, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: They came from foreign countries, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Based upon your experience over 20 years, Neverland was a real attraction for children around the world, wasn't it?
Jesus Salas: Yes, it was.
Mr. Mesereau: And you considered a major part of your responsibility to be making sure that Neverland was kept up properly so that when children from all over the world came, they'd have a good time, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Over 20 years, it may have been hundreds of thousands of children you saw visit, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you about the time Janet Arvizo asked you to drive her to Los Angeles, okay?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Jesus Castillo, our investigator, that at no time did anyone forcibly keep her at Neverland Ranch, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And at no time was she ever locked in her room, right?
Jesus Salas: Not that I was aware of.
Mr. Mesereau: And at no time was she kept at Neverland Ranch against her will, right?
Jesus Salas: That is exactly what I said, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: She called you upset and asked you to take her home and you did so, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You took her, yourself, in December; is that correct? Do you remember what month you took her yourself in the Rolls Royce?
Jesus Salas: It was December or January, somewhere around there. Pretty bad on dates.
Mr. Mesereau: And then she came back, what, in less than a week?
Jesus Salas: I would say in about a couple weeks, thereabout.
Mr. Mesereau: She came back, and then, a few weeks later, wanted to leave again, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you arranged transportation for her to leave again, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I had to call a limo.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was, as far as you know, the last time you ever saw the Arvizos, correct?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: When you drove Ms. Arvizo and her children in the Rolls Royce, she never made any complaints about the way she'd been treated at Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: She never said she'd been abused at Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: She never said her children had been taken advantage of at Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: But she didn't seem to like Dieter or Ronald, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And she told you she was concerned about media attention on her family, right?
Jesus Salas: She mentioned about that, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Her concerns to you were media attention and the fact that she didn't like Dieter, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: She never complained about anything else, did she?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, she told you she respected and liked Michael Jackson, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes, she did.
Mr. Mesereau: She never complained to you about Michael Jackson at all, did she?
Jesus Salas: Never.
Mr. Mesereau: When you drove her in the Rolls Royce, she was in the front seat with you, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Her children were in the back seat, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you and she spoke during that three-hour trip, right?
Jesus Salas: She didn't spoke too much, but, yes, she did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you speak to her very much when she used to stay at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And in -- on that trip, excuse me, Janet Arvizo never complained that she was being taken out of the country against her will, did she?
Jesus Salas: No, she never said anything.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember when she returned, you think, within the next couple of weeks?
Jesus Salas: It was in the next couple of weeks, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember seeing her suddenly show up with her children again?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know what time of day that was?
Jesus Salas: I believe it was afternoon.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you talk to her when you saw her return?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: You never got the impression she was there against her will at that point, did you?
Jesus Salas: No, I didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: The last time Janet and the kids left Neverland, do you know who drove them home?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I called a limousine service.
Mr. Mesereau: So you took her in a Rolls Royce one time, and the last time it was a limousine service that you arranged, true?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember any other times that Janet and the children left Neverland?
Jesus Salas: That was the last time I saw them.
Mr. Mesereau: So you're only personally aware of two times where they left Neverland; is that right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That you had anything to do with?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, the prosecutor asked you about a safe that was brought onto the property to lock keys. Do you remember that?
Jesus Salas: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: And if you remember, whose idea was it to put a safe where the keys could be locked?
Jesus Salas: It was the ranch manager idea and my idea.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you discuss it with Michael Jackson?
Jesus Salas: No, we never did.
Mr. Mesereau: You just ordered a safe?
Jesus Salas: We just ordered a safe.
Mr. Mesereau: And you put the keys in the safe?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And before that, where were the keys kept?
Jesus Salas: They were kept in the same room, behind the -- behind the door to the entry to the room, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that the entrance to the wine cellar?
Jesus Salas: No, no, no. That's the entrance to the maids' room.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. But they were hung out in open view, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember Frank Tyson's sister, Marie Nicole?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember her staying at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember her walking around the property and playing with Michael Jackson?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your impression that the family was close to Michael Jackson?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see Frank Tyson's parents visit from time to time?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you remember their names?
Jesus Salas: I don't. Sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see Frank Tyson's brothers visit from time to time?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You talked about a combination to Mr. Jackson's room. Remember that?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you always have that combination?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know if anyone else had it, to your knowledge?
Jesus Salas: Ranch manager.
Mr. Mesereau: What about staff who cleaned the room? Did they typically have it?
Jesus Salas: Yes. Yes. We have -- we had another guy there that also had it, know the combination of the room.
Mr. Mesereau: And that combination was changed periodically, right?
Jesus Salas: My time there, we changed it about a couple times.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember it being changed because too many people seemed to have it?
Jesus Salas: We noticed there was so many kids going into the room, so we figured we change the combination, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember Michael Jackson complaining that Frank was going into his bedroom when Michael was out of town?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your understanding that Frank could get into that room on occasion?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know whether or not Frank seemed like he could get into Michael's bedroom from time to time?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever observe Frank in Michael Jackson's bedroom?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see Marie Nicole in Michael Jackson's bedroom?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And again, when I say “bedroom”, we're talking about two levels, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: It's a rather large area, isn't it?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And on the lower level, people can sit down and enjoy themselves, can't they?
Jesus Salas: That is correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What do you recall there being on the lower level of Michael Jackson's bedroom when you were working there?
Jesus Salas: I just recall that it was a peaceful area that people can sit and enjoy themselves there. Fireplace or -- it was pretty peaceful place to be.
Mr. Mesereau: And he would entertain people in the lower portion of his bedroom, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: People would get served food there, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: People would get served drinks there, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you say there's a fireplace?
Jesus Salas: There's a fireplace there.
Mr. Mesereau: People would sit around the fireplace and chat, correct?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And sometimes they did it when Mr. Jackson was there, and sometimes they did it when he wasn't there, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Foundation; assumes facts.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer. Do you want the question read back?
Mr. Mesereau: Do you want -- I'm sorry.
Jesus Salas: Answer it?
The Court: Yes. Do you want the question read back?
Jesus Salas: No, I understood the question. Pretty much when Mr. Jackson wasn't there, nobody was allowed to go into his room.
Mr. Mesereau: There were times when he let people in, weren't there?
Jesus Salas: Yes, there was.
Mr. Mesereau: And they would have some fun when Mr. Jackson wasn't even there, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, approximately what year did you start working at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: Since the beginning, do you mean?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jesus Salas: I would say in '83, 1983.
Mr. Mesereau: '83?
Jesus Salas: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: So, there was a point in time where your daughter used to visit Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And what is her name?
Jesus Salas: Sandra.
Mr. Mesereau: Sandra used to visit when she was approximately five years old, right?
Jesus Salas: Five, six, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: She used to play with Michael Jackson, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes, that is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: He used to give her gifts, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, normally do people who work at Neverland bring their children there very often?
Jesus Salas: We have -- they have what is called “Family Day”, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And please tell the jury what “Family Day” is.
Jesus Salas: Family Day is a day where it's open for the employees to bring all your family and have access to all the facilities there, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And how often does that happen?
Jesus Salas: Once a year at least.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's a big event at Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And Michael Jackson closes Neverland off for other visits and lets all of the help and their family take over pretty much, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And it starts in the morning, doesn't it?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Goes late into the evening, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you mentioned a petting zoo before. Please tell the jury what the petting zoo is.
Jesus Salas: The petting zoo is a place where they have just little animals for kids, where they can go and play with the animals. We have -- I mean, they have a variety of animals where kids can, pretty safe, go and touch the animals.
Mr. Mesereau: And what kind of animals do you have in the petting zoo?
Jesus Salas: Well, they have llamas. They have deers. They are rabbits. They have pigs. Birds. What else do they have? They have lots of animals.
Mr. Mesereau: And the petting zoo is primarily designed for kids, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And then you have a larger zoo, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And please tell the jury what's in the larger zoo.
Jesus Salas: Well, that's where you can find the big animals. Like you can find elephants, lions, chimpanzees. You can find llamas and different other animals. Wolfs. Stuff like that.
Mr. Mesereau: You got giraffes, right?
Jesus Salas: Giraffes.
Mr. Mesereau: There's a camel?
Jesus Salas: Right, exactly.
Mr. Mesereau: And typically, at least once a day, the trainers walk two elephants through the property, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And they walk the elephants through the property, and very often guests, if they follow the rules, can feed them, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And Mr. Jackson will pay for bags of doughnuts and goodies to give to the elephants, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that a once-a-day affair?
Jesus Salas: Yes, pretty much once a day.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. It's usually a big thing for kids and their parents, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, as part of your duties at Neverland, you often would pay for toys for kids, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you would be reimbursed, typically, if you spent your own money on toys, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You would get a reimbursement check of -- for as much as $11,000 from time to time, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what kind of rules did you follow as far as buying toys for kids is concerned?
Jesus Salas: Really wasn't any rules. We just went and bought some toys.
Mr. Mesereau: But the prosecutor asked you questions about how influential Mr. Jackson was in running affairs. Didn't he give you a lot of flexibility in just going out, buying hundreds of toys, and then just charging him for it?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And where would you go buy those toys?
Jesus Salas: Toys-R-Us.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Would you drive there yourself?
Jesus Salas: Pretty much Mr. Jackson came along or with the kids or some adults, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And Mr. Jackson would from time to time let you drive parents and their children to Toys-R-Us, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And he would tell you to buy them whatever they'd like, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You'd spend thousands of dollars on these kids, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was one of your responsibilities as ranch manager, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: To try and take care of the children as best you could, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, what are the safety regulations in effect at the zoo, to your knowledge?
Jesus Salas: Well, there's certain regulations for the zoo, especially with the big animals. Again, for the safety of the guests or kids, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you have all these amusement rides as well, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Please tell the jury what amusements rides you have for the kids and the parents.
Jesus Salas: Well, there's different rides. The Ferris wheel. They have the merry-go-round. They have a big slide. They have a -- oh, got -- they have the Sea Dragon. They have various rides also for kids, for small kids, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you have these busloads of kids and adults show up and they want to use the rides, what safety precautions do you have?
Jesus Salas: Well, we have a -- we just got to make sure that the kids don't get hurt. We have regulations for that. We have personnel there guiding the kids and taking care of the kids so nobody gets hurt.
Mr. Mesereau: And the personnel specialize in the amusement park portion of Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And are they in charge of maintaining the rides, making sure the machinery's okay?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And were they under your supervision?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Who was supervising the people who run the amusement park?
Jesus Salas: There's -- Neverland has different groups of people, you know, like departments, what we call it, and it was the person in charge of the amusement park.
Mr. Mesereau: Just like there's a group in charge of the petting zoo and the bigger zoo, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when these children and these adults visit Neverland, these different groups are all available to make sure kids are safe, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, when you have hundreds of children running around Neverland, they can sometimes get into all kinds of mischievous situations, right?
Jesus Salas: Absolutely, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You've seen kids caught in the house in various rooms, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And they've been politely asked to leave, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You've seen kids trying to get in doors they're not supposed to get through, correct?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You've seen kids trying to get into the arcade whenever they can, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And kids are sometimes caught with things in their hands, little things they found in the main house and they have -- you have to take them away from them, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And it's never been your understanding that Mr. Jackson is personally supervising all of this, right?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, he's amazingly generous in letting people come into his home and go through it, and see it, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he is.
Mr. Mesereau: And this is a large home that has a lot of beautiful antiques, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: A lot of family pictures, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: He has things he's collected from all over the world, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And he often lets whoever visits come through the house so they can see all of this, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when he has guests stay over in the guest quarters, I believe you said that they pretty much can walk into that main house when they want, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: He has staff available all the time to prepare a meal for them if they want one, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And in that kitchen area, you have unlocked -- an unlocked refrigerator area, correct?
Jesus Salas: That's correct. It's open.
Mr. Mesereau: And they can go in there all the time and get sodas, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Juice, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Milk?
Jesus Salas: Whatever their choice is.
Mr. Mesereau: And you'll find wine in there, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And he lets his adult guests go in there and get wine when they choose, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And glasses are nearby if they want a glass, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: It's a very large refrigerator area, isn't it?
Jesus Salas: It is.
Mr. Mesereau: How many glass doors do you think are on that large refrigerated area?
Jesus Salas: Oh, God. About six, eight, something like that.
Mr. Mesereau: Six or eight transparent doors they can go into to get all kinds of beer, wine, soda, milk, orange juice, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And there's a menu that's posted on a blackboard most days, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what do you typically find on that menu?
Jesus Salas: You find the menu for the food or whatever the people wants to use.
Mr. Mesereau: There's usually some special dishes that the staff are preparing for that day, right?
Jesus Salas: Exactly, yes. Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And there also is a standard menu that Michael Jackson printed up that he gives that people have to order from, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you got sandwiches and soup and stuff like that, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And on that bar area where people can come anytime of day, you can sit there and just ask whoever is there to prepare eggs or an omelet, whatever you want, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And there are homemade buns and doughnuts that are put on there every day, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: Anytime of day, 24 hours a day, you can go into that main house and get what you want, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Even when Mr. Jackson is upstairs with his children, very often people will come downstairs to either see the house or get something to eat, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you about candy and ice cream and stuff like that. That's available to everybody, isn't it?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: It's not just available to children. It's available for adults as well, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you walk into that theater, you've got a whole candy/ice cream area in the front, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And typically, Mr. Jackson will have one of his people there just to serve whatever people want, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Ice cream sandwiches, ice cream cones, right?
Jesus Salas: Whatever they prefer, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: There's a big popcorn area, correct?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you will see sometimes visitors looking at movies anytime of day, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And there's a huge collection of movies they can sometimes choose from, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And other times there are just a couple that you can choose for the day, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. There are other areas of Neverland people want to see, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: There are areas where they can see Mr. Jackson's costumes that he's worn on music tours, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: There are areas where they can see his glove? Kids love to see the gloves he's worn, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, some of the memorabilia from his musical tours around the world are actually in an area not far from the wine cellar; correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You also have sleeping bags stored down in the area near where the wine cellar is, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you work there before Mr. Jackson purchased the property?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: That wine cellar area was already there when Mr. Jackson purchased the property, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes, it was.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, there is a procedures manual at Neverland that, at least on paper, identifies what people are supposed to do or not do, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And security is a concern there, is it not?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Because if you really look at the perimeter of Neverland, you can get in those fences, can't you?
Jesus Salas: Absolutely, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, it's -- it's easy for anyone to go in or out of those three-rail fences anytime, right?
Jesus Salas: Absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: And you've caught people on the property who tried to get over to Neverland and find Mr. Jackson, correct?
Jesus Salas: Many times.
Mr. Mesereau: And there are roads around the property where cars drive at high speeds, correct?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And there is also a concern that children will somehow wander on the road, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me get back to Janet Arvizo. Didn't she complain one time that she felt Frank and Vinnie were separating her from Michael Jackson?
Jesus Salas: I don't recall her telling me that, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Did she complain that Dieter and Ronald were separating her from Michael Jackson?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: She appeared not to like Dieter or Ronald at all, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When Janet and the children would arrive on the property, were they given assistance in transporting their luggage to their rooms?
Jesus Salas: Absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: Who would help Janet transport her luggage to her rooms?
Jesus Salas: Many times it was security, Neverland Valley security, or myself.
Mr. Mesereau: And would Janet pretty much tell you what to carry from her car or however she got there?
Jesus Salas: No, not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Who would assign the rooms to the Arvizos when they visited and stayed at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And what would determine, for you, what room to put them in?
Jesus Salas: It would depend. Many times we had some other guests on the property. And if we have one available, that was the only one that was going to be for them. And many times I ask them, “Okay, which room do you guys want to stay in?” So that's how I decided.
Mr. Mesereau: Did anyone ever complain about the room that they were placed in?
Jesus Salas: No, not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Did the kids ever complain?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: The rooms they were placed in, as far as you're concerned, were all beautiful rooms, weren't they?
Jesus Salas: Yes, they are.
Mr. Mesereau: They were cleaned every day, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And they had constant room service if they wanted it, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Jackson wanted them treated just as well as any other guests, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times, Mr. Salas, has the prosecution contacted you to talk to you about the case?
Jesus Salas: A couple times.
Mr. Mesereau: And how many times did you meet with representatives of the sheriff's department?
Jesus Salas: A couple times.
Mr. Mesereau: They never asked you if you ever brought nonalcoholic beverages for the Arvizo children, did they? They never asked you that question, did they?
Jesus Salas: No, they didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, I think you said that Michael Jackson appeared frustrated at what Frank was doing on the property from time to time, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct. Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; misstates the evidence.
Mr. Mesereau: I don't think it does, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled. The answer was, “Yes”. Next question.
Mr. Mesereau: Michael Jackson was frustrated that Frank was bringing guests to Neverland without him knowing about it, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And how old was Frank at the time, do you think?
Jesus Salas: I'm not sure how old was he. I will say he was about, what, 35.
Mr. Mesereau: Early twenties?
Jesus Salas: Somewhere around there, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, how was Frank able to bring guests to the property without Michael Jackson knowing about it?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: It was his own decision.
Mr. Mesereau: But what would Frank do, if you know, to bring guests onto the property without Michael Jackson knowing about it?
Jesus Salas: What he would do there?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jesus Salas: Just have fun at Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, no, excuse me. I didn't state it properly. It's my mistake. If Frank wanted to bring guests onto the property without Michael Jackson knowing about it, what would he do?
Jesus Salas: He would just call security and tell -- let security know that he had some guests coming in, or tell me.
Mr. Mesereau: Would he typically tell them that Michael wants them visiting?
Jesus Salas: No, he never said that.
Mr. Mesereau: He just said he wanted them to visit, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And he would bring a number of female guests from time to time, correct?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Overruled. The answer is, “Correct”.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, he tried to bring a lot of girls onto the property, didn't he?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: He used to brag to them that he was a friend to Michael Jackson, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Hearsay; relevance.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you mentioned someone named Malnik visited the property one time, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you speak to him?
Jesus Salas: Not in a conversation, no, I didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: You just saw him?
Jesus Salas: Just saw him, say hi. And that was it.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor mentioned someone named Zia, right?
Jesus Salas: That's correct. That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see Zia on the property?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you talk to him?
Jesus Salas: Just for a short time. Not --
Mr. Mesereau: And Zia was, to your knowledge, Mr. Jackson's attorney, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see him there often?
Jesus Salas: No, I only saw him there a couple times.
Mr. Mesereau: And what did you see him doing?
Jesus Salas: Just had a meeting with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You would see all kinds of people visit from time to time to meet with Mr. Jackson, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; vague.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll rephrase.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor has limited his questions to you to Dieter, Ronald, Frank. Mr. Jackson didn't spend all of his time meeting with these people, did he?
Jesus Salas: Not all the time, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Jackson from time to time would have numerous visitors to Neverland to see him, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; vague as to time.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You would often see a full schedule of people visiting Neverland to see Mr. Jackson, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall Mr. Jackson doing work in his studio at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what do you recall seeing him doing?
Jesus Salas: Doing some recording. Dancing. Practicing. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you watch him practice dance?
Jesus Salas: No, I didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: And how did you know he was practicing dance? Would he tell you?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And would he tell you not to let anyone in, that he's doing his creative work?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: Because of his work, yes, he did not want to be bothered, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you also see him teaching kids how to dance from time to time?
Jesus Salas: I never saw that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How about in his recording studio, would he bring kids and adults into his recording studio to see it?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: And didn't he used to show them how he does his work in his recording studio?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And sometimes he wanted to just be left alone in there, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when he wanted to be left alone, he'd spend hours and hours in there, right?
Jesus Salas: That's correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you would see Mr. Jackson awake on his property at all different hours, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Sometimes he gets up at 3:00 in the morning, doesn't he?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And he will take walks alone on his property, right?
Jesus Salas: That's right.
Mr. Mesereau: That's how he does a lot of his composing, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You'd also see Mr. Jackson from time to time driving alone on his property, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Would you know in advance if Mr. Jackson was going to leave the property to go somewhere?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And who would you -- who would tell you that Mr. Jackson was leaving the property?
Jesus Salas: Sometimes I found out about -- by his bodyguard.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And what are some of the other ways that you would find out Mr. Jackson might be either leaving the property or going out of town?
Jesus Salas: By Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you speak to Mr. Jackson every day when he was there?
Jesus Salas: Pretty much, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When he wasn't there, who would you speak to?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Ambiguous; relevance.
The Court: Overruled.
Jesus Salas: When he wasn't there, well, nobody is -- the ranch manager.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me ask you this: When Mr. Jackson's out of town, which you saw him do quite often during your 20 years there, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: You saw him go on music tours, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you saw him travel to various cities in America, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And he would travel to various cities around the world, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When he's not there, does the place pretty much run the way it runs when he's there?
Jesus Salas: It runs the same way.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's because there are various procedures in effect to make sure it runs properly, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When Mr. Jackson's there, he's not walking around the property just running everything, is he?
Jesus Salas: No, no.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, very often when he's there, you hardly see him, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Because Mr. Jackson is doing his creative work for hours and hours on end, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: So how does the place sort of run when he's not there? I mean, if you can explain it.
Jesus Salas: Because of the people in charge of running the place, so we'll -- the place always running the same, so -- whether he's there or not.
Mr. Mesereau: And even if he's there, you have to report to other individuals to get information, don't you?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So when the prosecutor asked you about your reporting directly to Michael Jackson, you didn't mean you're talking to him all day about what's going on?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And if you report to him on a given day, it might be just one time, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. In response to the prosecutor's questions, you mentioned some things about Frank saying he'll take care of things, correct?
Jesus Salas: Correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: But Frank also used to brag about how close he was to Michael Jackson, didn't he?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't get the impression he was always telling the truth, did you?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; calls for a conclusion.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You said, in response to the prosecutor's questions, that on occasion you would see Frank and Michael Jackson together, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: But you also often saw Frank not around Mr. Jackson, correct?
Jesus Salas: Oh, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you often saw Mr. Jackson without Frank, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you didn't really know what work Frank was doing, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: But from time to time, he would try and brag that he was in the music business, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: I want to ask you a little more about security at Neverland, okay? It's about 2800 acres of property, right?
Jesus Salas: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: Very spread out over hills, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And it's surrounded by these fences that you said anybody could come in, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You have a front gate that you have to stop at if you're driving in, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you have to push a button and identify who you are, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And people at that security gate typically have a list of who's supposed to be allowed in, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And I think what you said is that Frank would often call the people at that gate and say, “Let so and so in”, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you did indicate there had been efforts by people to drive and get onto the property and find Mr. Jackson, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And you have some security guards who patrol the property a bit, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And they don't have weapons, right?
Jesus Salas: Not to my knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: Because Michael Jackson doesn't want weapons on his property, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Foundation; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know whether or not Mr. Jackson has a policy that he doesn't want weapons on his property?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: And he's typically very concerned about his children's safety, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You said that Frank was staying in the video library, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And was there a bed in there?
Jesus Salas: It's a couch that turns into a bed, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that where he would stay when he visited?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: There were long periods of time Frank wasn't even there, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection as to -- vague as to time.
Mr. Mesereau: Let's go to 2003. I'll rephrase it, Your Honor.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Mesereau: Let's take the year 2003. There were periods of time you wouldn't even see Frank on the property, right?
Jesus Salas: There was some times, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And there are times you would also see him, correct?
Jesus Salas: Correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: There were times you would see Dieter on the property, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And there were times you wouldn't see him at all, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: There were times you'd see Ron on the property, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And there were times you wouldn't see him at all?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And during this period of time, you had your constant visitors on a daily basis to the property, correct?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You had many other people who had scheduled meetings with Michael Jackson, right?
Jesus Salas: Right. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you also had your periodic tours of children and adults to Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You indicated that you think that Mr. Jackson was at Neverland when the Arvizos visited in 2003, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: You're not sure that he was there every day, though, are you?
Jesus Salas: That is right, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: If there were days he wasn't there when the Arvizos were there in 2003, you're just not sure, correct? That's a bad question. Let me -- I don't think I could answer that one. In 2003 when the Arvizos were at Neverland, sometimes Michael Jackson was there and sometimes he wasn't, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct. There was days that he was not there, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: There were times he was out of town, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: There were times he was gone from the premises during the day, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: There were times he was in his studio, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: There were times he was doing his dance routines, correct?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: There were times he was taking children around Neverland on a tour, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And there would be constant meetings of one form or another involving Michael Jackson with other people, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. The prosecutor asked you about Michael Jackson playing with kids. Michael Jackson plays with kids all the time at Neverland, doesn't he?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he does.
Mr. Mesereau: He often acts like a kid himself, doesn't he?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And he takes pride particularly in bringing inner city kids to Neverland to have fun, doesn't he?
Jesus Salas: Correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: We're talking about kids from poverty, kids from broken homes, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: He sometimes personally arranges those visits himself, doesn't he?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know whether or not Michael Jackson sometimes personally arranges visits by kids to Neverland?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And typically when these busloads of kids get to Neverland, they all want to see Michael Jackson, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And sometimes you schedule all these kids and these adults to be at a certain location to wait for Michael to come out and see them, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll object as cumulative.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: Isn't that true?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And he would call you and arrange to have toys available for all these kids when they would visit, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you would typically have all the kids assemble on the property, and staff would start distributing toys to them, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And very often in the middle of the toy distribution, Michael comes out to see the kids, right?
Jesus Salas: On some occasion, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you'll see them running to Michael. They want to see him; they want to touch him, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: The adults will do the same, correct?
Jesus Salas: Correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you what these children do at Neverland, and you talked about bike riding.
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you mean by bike riding?
Jesus Salas: He's got so many toys, they can just take off on the quad-runners, scooters. That's what I meant.
Mr. Mesereau: And you never got the impression Michael Jackson was supervising the bike riding, did you?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: People on the property who worked for Mr. Jackson take care of that, don't they?
Jesus Salas: Especially security, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And also you expect the parents or the adults in charge to have some responsibility, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You talked about quads, okay. And what did you mean by that?
Jesus Salas: They have those four-wheelers that they can go off, off the road. That's --
Mr. Mesereau: And they typically ride on the roads at Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And who supervises that, typically?
Jesus Salas: Oh, themself. Themselves or security.
Mr. Mesereau: You have never thought Michael Jackson was walking around supervising who got into those vehicles, did you?
Jesus Salas: No, no.
Mr. Mesereau: He doesn't seem to supervise any of that, does he?
Jesus Salas: No, he doesn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. He assumes staff on the premises will, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Objection. No foundation, as to what Mr. Jackson assumes. Calls for speculation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the prosecutor that sometimes Michael Jackson would play with kids on a daily basis, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you would see him playing with kids all over the premises, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see Michael Jackson take these kids to the petting zoo?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see him take them to the bigger zoo?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see him take them to the arcade?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see him take them to the theater?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How about ride with them on the train?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. This went on all the time, didn't it?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you questions about Mr. Jackson appearing intoxicated, okay?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you never saw him drinking, right?
Jesus Salas: No, I didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: And were you aware that there were times when he had a prescription drug problem?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I -- yes, I was.
Mr. Mesereau: And he had gotten a lot of injections from various physicians?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know Michael Jackson had -- excuse me, let me rephrase. Did you know whether or not Mr. Jackson at various times had a prescription drug problem?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you know he was treated for that?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When you saw him appearing intoxicated, you don't know what the cause was, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew he had suffered severe burns on his body, didn't you?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Foundation; relevance.
The Court: Foundation; sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know whether or not, during one entertainment event, Mr. Jackson suffered severe burns all over his body?
Mr. Auchincloss: Ob -- I'll --
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know he was being treated for that?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; vague as to time.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know whether or not Mr. Jackson was being treated by physicians with medication because he'd been badly burned?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; vague as to time.
Mr. Mesereau: At any time?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That was common knowledge at Neverland, was it not?
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll object and move to strike the last answer. Still vague as to time.
The Court: Stricken.
Mr. Mesereau: During the year 2002, were you aware -- excuse me. During the year 2002, do you know whether or not Michael Jackson was being treated by various physicians for health problems?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Vague as to “health problems”.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll object as to foundation.
The Court: The answer -- the question calls for a “yes” or “no” answer. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And during the year 2002, were you aware that Mr. Jackson --
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection to the form of the question. “Were you aware” assumes facts.
The Court: You have to let him finish the question.
Mr. Mesereau: During the year 2002, were you aware -- excuse me. During the year 2002, did you know whether or not Mr. Jackson was taking medications for a broken leg?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: During the year 2002, did you know whether or not Mr. Jackson was taking medications for a foot problem?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And during the year 2002, did you know whether or not Mr. Jackson had recurring problems because he had been badly burned?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: During the year 2002, did you know whether or not Mr. Jackson had back problems?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm going to object as to foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: During the year 2003, did you know whether or not Mr. Jackson was taking prescription drugs for a leg problem?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know whether or not Mr. Jackson took prescription drugs in the year 2003 while you were working there?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Overruled.
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall seeing Mr. Jackson's children in his bedroom?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: They would be in there a lot during the time you worked there, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You would see his children at the lower level, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You would see them in his bedroom upstairs, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you typically spend much time with Mr. Jackson's children?
Jesus Salas: I would say I didn't spend too much time with them because -- but saw them, I mean, every day there, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Every day?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you would mainly see them in the main house?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Would you see them on the property also?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: But you saw them in his room quite often, didn't you?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know anything about an alarm system that one has to use to get into Mr. Jackson's bedroom?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; vague as to “one has to use” an alarm system.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And have you set off that alarm from time to time?
Jesus Salas: No, not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you heard the alarm go off?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know much about that alarm system?
Jesus Salas: I know about it, but I -- you know, not -- didn't get involved in that too much.
Mr. Mesereau: It's not something that you would typically handle?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Have you seen Mr. Jackson entertain adults at his home in the evening?
Jesus Salas: Oh, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: He does that quite often, doesn't he?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when he does that, you often see adults drinking alcohol, don't you?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: You see staff serving them alcohol, right?
Jesus Salas: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And they're free to go into the kitchen area and grab alcohol if they want to, typically, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You've also seen them served alcohol in his bedroom, correct?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You've seen adults sitting in the lower level of his bedroom drinking, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And typically there would be an order placed by someone, and staff will bring alcohol into his bedroom for that purpose, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, the prosecutor asked you about complaints involving kids in the wine cellar, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: During the 20 years you worked at Neverland, that area you call the wine cellar was always a wine cellar, was it not?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And this is the area that you said, close by, has an area which has Mr. Jackson's memorabilia from tours around the world, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And in that area nearby is where you can see his costumes, his gloves, and things of that sort, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And typically kids and adults want to go there and see all these costumes from his very successful music career, right?
Jesus Salas: That is right, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And once in a while, somebody will bring people down to that cellar area so they can see all that memorabilia, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Misstates the evidence that the memorabilia is in the cellar area.
Mr. Mesereau: That's what he testified to, Your Honor.
The Court: No, it's not. Rephrase your question.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Let's take the area that we've identified as the wine cellar, okay? You got to go down the stairs to get there, right?
Jesus Salas: Right, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When you get down those stairs, where do you see the wine cellar when you reach the foot of the stairs?
Jesus Salas: It's on the wall. Placed on the wall.
Mr. Mesereau: There are other areas around the wine cellar which have other purposes in the house, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And doesn't one of those areas have costumes, gloves, and memorabilia from Mr. Jackson's tours?
Jesus Salas: Not specifically in that area.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, it's not far away, though, right?
Jesus Salas: It's outside there.
Mr. Mesereau: But you can certainly -- from time to time, he has stored stuff there, hasn't he?
Jesus Salas: Yes. I would say that, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And sometimes people have gone down to look at that stuff, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And there's some other areas at Neverland where that stuff is stored as well, right?
Jesus Salas: The main part, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Because there's a ton of stuff.
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: From a long, successful career.
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, during the 20 years you've been at Neverland, there have been very few complaints about children being in the wine cellar, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You're talking about maybe a couple over a 20-year period, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, during my time there, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Jackson's policy is not to let kids in the wine cellar, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor talked about young boys from Los Olivos, and you identified their pictures, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And you've seen them there with their parents from time to time, haven't you?
Jesus Salas: No, not with their parents.
Mr. Mesereau: The parents have visited?
Jesus Salas: Yes, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: But they also have come from time to time on their own, correct?
Jesus Salas: Themself, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And they've come from time to time when Mr. Jackson wasn't even there, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And people on the property know them, correct?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And generally nobody objects to their visiting Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: They sometimes come alone and they sometimes come with their parents, right?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: They're really neighbors, aren't they?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And once in a while they've gotten into some trouble there, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: They've been known as mischievous kids, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: They've been caught in various places around Neverland, haven't they?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: They've been caught in rooms, true?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: They were caught playing hide-and-seek in the house, weren't they?
Jesus Salas: Right, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, if you catch kids playing hide-and-seek in the house or getting into trouble, typically what do you do?
Jesus Salas: Well, you try to explain to them that -- you know, if you caught them doing something they're not supposed to be doing, you just let them know that, you know, that's not what they should be -- you know, that there's some certain things that, you know, they're allowed to do, there's things that they're not allowed to do, so we let them know.
Mr. Mesereau: But like -- let's take these kids from Los Olivos that are neighbors who are allowed on the property, and sometimes their parents aren't there. Who kind of watches them when they come alone?
Jesus Salas: Pretty much nobody. They're on their own.
Mr. Mesereau: Do people on the property keep an eye on them, or what happens?
Jesus Salas: Well, you know, I would say yes, security, just for safety reasons, yes. Or the staff personnel if they're at the amusement park, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: If they go into the main house, which they do from time to time, who would be in the main house typically, who might see them?
Jesus Salas: I would say that will be the maids, the cooks, yes. Or myself.
Mr. Mesereau: And if they start going upstairs into the bedrooms, who are they likely to run into?
Jesus Salas: Well, they'll run into the doors. They can't go in.
Mr. Mesereau: Besides the doors, who might they see? Will they see the people who are cleaning?
Jesus Salas: Yes, they might run into maids or somebody else from the house staff. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And how many kids are we talking about?
Jesus Salas: We're talking about the --
Mr. Mesereau: Three?
Jesus Salas: Three kids, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And how long have they been coming onto the property, to your knowledge? Excuse me, let me rephrase that. When you were working there, for how long a period of time do you remember their coming freely on and off the property?
Jesus Salas: They would come in frequently.
Mr. Mesereau: Regularly?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it be in the evening, morning, weekends? What would it be?
Jesus Salas: It would be weekends or days, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And how would they get on? Would they go through the main gate?
Jesus Salas: Yes, they did.
Mr. Mesereau: And do people in the main gate know them?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And do they typically just let them walk onto the property?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Would somebody drive them anywhere?
Jesus Salas: Well, sometimes they drove to the place, so -- yes, they drove their own car.
Mr. Mesereau: And how old were these young boys?
Jesus Salas: Young kids; 15, 16.
Mr. Mesereau: 15, 16?
Jesus Salas: Yes, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And they're the ones that got in trouble from time to time?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Would anyone call their parents up typically and say, “Your teenaged kids are in trouble”?
Jesus Salas: Not my knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Were they ever asked to leave the property, to your knowledge?
Jesus Salas: Not to my knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: Actually, Mr. Jackson didn't want them to get in trouble with their parents, did he?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Calls for speculation; no foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me ask you a few more questions about the Arvizos at Neverland. You saw the Arvizo children roaming freely around Neverland when they stayed there, correct?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: They'd use the amusement rides when they chose, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: They'd go into the theater when they wanted to, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: They jumped on the train when they wanted to, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And they would visit the zoo when they chose, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see the mother supervising the children at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see her keeping an eye on the children at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When you saw them at the zoo, do you recall the mother ever being with them?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When you saw the Arvizo children at the amusement park on the rides, did you ever see the mother with them?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; cumulative.
The Court: Overruled.
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When you saw the Arvizo children on the train, did you ever see their mother with them?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When you saw the Arvizo children in the theater, did you see the mother with them?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: But you saw the mother eating in the main house, didn't you?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you saw her walking around the property, right?
Jesus Salas: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: Would you describe the Arvizo children as mischievous?
Jesus Salas: At some point.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, they got in trouble at the amusement park, didn't they?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Tell the jury what happened.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; 403.
The Court: The objection is overruled. But we're going to take our break, so we'll start with that question when we come back.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Counsel? Go ahead.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Just a couple more questions. You mentioned that the Arvizo family returned to Neverland a number of times in 2003, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know how they got to Neverland?
Jesus Salas: I believe they did on the limo.
Mr. Mesereau: A limo?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your impression that the Arvizos had access to a limousine service when they wanted to?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; foundation.
Mr. Mesereau: I think there is a foundation, Your Honor.
The Court: I'll sustain the objection.
Mr. Mesereau: You indicated that on at least one occasion you called a limousine service so the Arvizos could leave Neverland, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said on the other occasion you took Michael's Rolls Royce and drove them yourself, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was in the middle of the night when Janet wanted to leave, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And I believe you said on other occasions when the Arvizos left Neverland, it was your understanding they always had a limousine, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know who would arrange for the limousines to transport the Arvizos?
Jesus Salas: I called them personally.
Mr. Mesereau: You would do it personally?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think you personally called a limousine service to transport the Arvizos?
Jesus Salas: I think it was around three times. Somewhere around there.
Mr. Mesereau: Is there a particular limousine service that you would normally call?
Jesus Salas: It's out of Santa Barbara. And it's called -- what is it called? Limo Link, I believe.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you wouldn't discuss with Michael Jackson the fact that you wanted to call a limousine service, right?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You had enough authority to do that if you thought it was the appropriate thing to do, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And was it your understanding that from time to time guests of Mr. Jackson would need a limousine?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you would get a call from someone asking for you to arrange for a limousine, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Actually, Mr. Jackson was pretty generous with arranging for limousines to take his guests off the property, wasn't he?
Jesus Salas: Correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall Janet Arvizo from time to time leaving the premises to go into town?
Jesus Salas: I believe there was only one time.
Mr. Mesereau: And did she talk to you about that?
Jesus Salas: Yes, she did.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your understanding she was getting a body wax that day?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And was it arranged for a limousine to take her to the body wax place?
Jesus Salas: No, it wasn't.
Mr. Mesereau: How did she get to the body wax place?
Jesus Salas: I sent one of the maids with her.
Mr. Mesereau: So you arranged for a maid to drive her to the body wax?
Jesus Salas: That, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That was a salon, right?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And was that in Los Olivos, if you know?
Jesus Salas: Los Olivos or Solvang, somewhere in there.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. She was away for quite a while that day, correct?
Jesus Salas: Correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall it being three or four hours?
Jesus Salas: Somewhere around there, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, did Janet tell you she wanted to get a body wax at a salon that day?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Why did you arrange for one of the maids to drive Janet Arvizo off the premises to get a body wax?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Foundation; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know why one of the maids drove Janet Arvizo off the premises to get a body wax?
Mr. Auchincloss: Same objection.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you in charge of the maid who drove Janet Arvizo off the premises to get a body wax?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I was.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ask the maid to do that?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: Why did you ask the maid to do that?
Jesus Salas: Well, I figured it was a --
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Hearsay; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know which car the maid used?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Just a couple more questions. Do you recall -- do you recall Mr. Jackson traveling to Florida during 2003?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall Mr. Jackson traveling to Las Vegas during 2003?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall him traveling anywhere else, if you can recall?
Jesus Salas: Pretty much, that I can remember was just Florida and Vegas.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Finally, the prosecutor asked you questions about some beds in the theater. Remember that?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Aren't those hospital beds for handicapped kids?
Jesus Salas: Yes, they are.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Salas, those hospital beds in the theater, does Mr. Jackson use those beds personally?
Jesus Salas: Occasionally, yes, to watch a movie.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do other kids who were not handicapped use those beds?
Jesus Salas: Yes, they do.
Mr. Auchincloss: As far as the limousines go, you testified on direct examination that you were told not to let the Arvizos off the property unless you got approval; is that correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you said that you arranged for three limousines -- three times that you arranged for limousines to transport the Arvizos off the property?
Jesus Salas: That I can remember, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Was this all -- those three times, were they all in 2003 during that period of time you've testified about?
Jesus Salas: I believe it was one time in 2002.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So the other two times that you ordered a limousine service to transport the Arvizos, did you get permission from somebody at the ranch to let them off the property?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who did you get permission from?
Jesus Salas: I got permission from -- it was Frank, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. You talked a little bit about a time at the dinner table when you suspected that Gavin had been drinking. Do you remember --
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: -- testifying about that? Was Michael Jackson present at the dinner table that night?
Jesus Salas: No, he was not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Frank present at the dinner table that night?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he was.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you ultimately determine whether Gavin had been drinking that night?
Jesus Salas: Didn't really specify that, but I -- just by the way he was acting, I knew that he was drinking.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there another time when you saw Gavin when he appeared to be drinking?
Jesus Salas: That was the only time.
Mr. Auchincloss: And that only time that you saw him drinking, that he appeared to be intoxicated, what was he doing that made you think that?
Jesus Salas: The way he was acting, just not normal. Just his reactions.
Mr. Auchincloss: Had you had occasion to see Gavin a number of times before that or after that when he was acting normal, in your opinion?
Jesus Salas: Ask the question again.
Mr. Auchincloss: I guess my question is, did you have a good frame of reference for judging whether Gavin was acting normal or not?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: That was the only time I saw that I noticed that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So my question was, did you spend enough time around Gavin to feel as if you could make a call as to whether or not he was acting drunk or not? Do you understand that question?
Jesus Salas: Yes, I do. I would say yes, I --
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And how was he acting that made you think he was -- how was he acting differently on that evening that made you think he was drunk?
Jesus Salas: Pretty simple. Just when somebody's drunk, I mean, you can tell by the way they look, their reaction, of the way they look, the way they talk. Just verbal, the way he was talking.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was it obvious to you he'd been drinking?
Jesus Salas: I would say yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you said Frank was at the table. Who else was at the table that night?
Jesus Salas: I believe it was Vinnie and some of Frank's guests, I believe it was. A couple girls, something like that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Gavin's mother around?
Jesus Salas: No, she was not.
Mr. Auchincloss: Now, as far as where the kids slept -- and maybe I'll back up, because I don't think I asked this question. What time of day was it that you saw Gavin where you thought he'd been drinking?
Jesus Salas: I would say it was about around nine o'clock, nighttime.
Mr. Auchincloss: Nighttime?
Jesus Salas: Uh-huh.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Mr. Jackson on the property at that time?
Jesus Salas: Yes, he was.
Mr. Auchincloss: When children slept in Mr. Jackson's bedroom, do you know, personally know, where they slept in the bedroom, as far as where they slept, upstairs or downstairs? Did you see it?
Jesus Salas: I didn't see exactly who slept on Mr. Jackson's bed, but I know there was kids there and -- yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: So you never spent the night in Mr. Jackson's bedroom, I take it?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: So you don't know where the kids slept after you left the room?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: But you were in the room at times when kids were there?
Jesus Salas: Right. Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And in terms of these kids, were they all boys that slept in Mr. Jackson's room?
Jesus Salas: Pretty much, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Now, Mr. Mesereau asked you about the first-class treatment that everyone received at Neverland. And you basically said that the adults got first-class treatment, too?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So did the kids get the same first-class treatment that the adults did?
Jesus Salas: Absolutely.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were they basically treated just like the adults?
Jesus Salas: Just like the adults.
Mr. Auchincloss: And these kids, when they were at Neverland during the 20 years you were there, did these kids ever have supervision?
Jesus Salas: Do you mean by --
Mr. Auchincloss: By Neverland. Any organized supervision of these children while they were at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: We really didn't have supervision. They had security that would keep an eye on the guests, or even the Neverland staff working at certain places, they had to make sure that the kids were safe. Not supervising them, but just for safety.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So if an employee was around and saw something dangerous, they might intervene; is that fair to say?
Jesus Salas: Of course, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: But the employees, they weren't running around supervising these kids where they were?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: They were allowed to run around wherever they wanted, do whatever they wanted?
Jesus Salas: Absolutely.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Some of this is offered as impeachment.
The Court: Well, that was leading, so....
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: Now, as far as the busloads of children go, were these children treated differently than the children who were guests at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were the busloads of children allowed to spend the night in Michael Jackson's room?
Jesus Salas: None of those kids spent the night in his room.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Were they given the access code to the house?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Were they allowed to -- were these children, did they bring their own supervision with them, adult supervision?
Jesus Salas: Yes, they did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was it organized? Were they organized as to where they would go and how they would spend their time at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: Absolutely, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Mr. Jackson even there when those busloads of kids would arrive or be there?
Jesus Salas: Many times he was there. Many times he wasn't there.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. When he was there, would he always come out or sometimes come out?
Jesus Salas: Sometimes come out.
Mr. Auchincloss: So there were times busloads of kids would arrive and Mr. Jackson wouldn't even come out to say hi?
Jesus Salas: Yes. There was times that he --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; misstates the evidence.
The Court: Overruled. The answer is, “Yes”. Next question.
Mr. Auchincloss: As far as Janet, when she was -- when she left Neverland the first time with her family, in the interview with the sheriff's department, didn't you say that, “The whole family, they were not allowed to go nowhere”?
Jesus Salas: Yes. That's what I said, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And that, “They had them there always, and they were with supervision”?
Jesus Salas: According to what she told me, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Didn't you say Frank Tyson was one of the individuals involved in the handling of the Arvizo family?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you say that Salas -- did you say that ranch employees were required to go through Frank Tyson with questions or problems regarding the Arvizo family?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you also say that Tyson -- that you believed Tyson would then, in turn, go through Mr. Jackson?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Mr. Auchincloss: This is impeachment.
Mr. Mesereau: No foundation.
The Court: The objection is overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you say that Tyson would then, in turn, go through Mr. Jackson?
Jesus Salas: Correct, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you say that the Arvizo family was not being allowed to leave the Neverland Ranch even though the mother wished to leave with her children?
Jesus Salas: That's correct, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: In the grand jury, when you testified, you were asked this question: You were asked whether or not you believed Janet Arvizo and her family was being kept against their will. You said, “Yes”; is that true?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; leading.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered as impeachment.
The Court: Overruled. He said, “Yes”.
Mr. Auchincloss: And is that a true statement?
The Court: He said, “Yes”.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: You said -- I believe when Mr. Mesereau was up here, you said that Mrs. Arvizo was never forcibly kept at Neverland; is that true?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: So no one ever used physical force on her?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: You said that when you took her home, that she told you that she was -- you told Mr. Mesereau that she was upset with the people at Neverland Ranch?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; misstates the evidence.
Mr. Auchincloss: Upset with Ronald -- I believe it was Dieter.
The Court: Do you want to rephrase the question?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: You told Mr. Mesereau that when you were taking Janet and the children home that first time, that she was upset with Dieter; is that correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Didn't you also previously state that she said she was upset with Frank as well, or no? You tell me.
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Now, you also told Mr. Mesereau that the -- at that time, when she left Neverland Ranch the first time, she was not angry at Michael Jackson?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. After she left Neverland that first time, did you ever talk to her about whether she was still angry at Michael Jackson?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have much contact with her after that first time?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you have any idea whether she is angry at Michael Jackson today?
Jesus Salas: I have no idea.
Mr. Auchincloss: You mentioned that you allowed your daughter Sandra to visit Mr. Jackson at Neverland.
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: When was that?
Jesus Salas: '91, '92, somewhere around there maybe. Maybe later than that. I'm not quite sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: So early '90s?
Jesus Salas: I would say so, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was it one occasion?
Jesus Salas: I believe it was about three times.
Mr. Auchincloss: Three times that she personally spent time with Mr. Jackson?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were all three of those occasions in '90, '91, in that early -- early 1990s?
Jesus Salas: It was during the same time, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you ever allow your daughter to sleep with Mr. Jackson?
Jesus Salas: She never slept over there.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Would you ever allow your daughter to sleep with Mr. Jackson?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Calls for speculation; leading; foundation.
The Court: It's argumentative; sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Knowing what you know today, based upon all your time at Neverland, do you believe this place is a healthy place, would be a healthy place for your daughter to visit?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Opinion; foundation; relevance.
Mr. Auchincloss: This was offered as an opinion as to --
The Court: The objection is sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Is it true to say that the kids do get hurt at Neverland?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Relevance; beyond the scope; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do kids ever get hurt at Neverland?
Mr. Mesereau: Same objection.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Counsel asked the question.
Mr. Mesereau: I never asked that question.
Mr. Auchincloss: Talked about safety.
The Court: All right. Quit talking to each other.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss: You said that some people invade Neverland or come in from the outside, correct?
Jesus Salas: Correct, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: How far is Neverland away from the nearest town?
Jesus Salas: Six miles.
Mr. Auchincloss: How do these people get out there?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: If you know.
The Court: The foundation is sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Do you know how these people get out there?
Jesus Salas: Yes, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss: How do they get out there?
Jesus Salas: Driving.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So these people who visit -- who try to get into Neverland have a car?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Where is the car?
Jesus Salas: They park on the outside of the property.
Mr. Auchincloss: You also said that Janet complained about being separated from Michael, that Dieter was separating her from Michael. Yes?
Jesus Salas: Yes. That was her expression, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Didn't she say that she was -- didn't she complain that Dieter was separating her from Michael Jackson and her children?
Jesus Salas: Not exactly what she said. She said that she was being separated from Michael.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. But didn't she reference her children when she was talking about that?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: You say “not exactly”. What do you mean?
Jesus Salas: She never mentioned the kids.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did she ever complain about being separated from her kids?
Jesus Salas: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: When Janet was at Neverland --
The Court: Wait. There was an objection.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll withdraw the objection.
The Court: Go ahead, Counsel. (Laughter.)
Mr. Auchincloss: When Janet was at Neverland, did she -- well, let me strike that. Do you know where Janet would spend most of her time while she was at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: She spent most of her time in the guesthouse.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know where she would take her meals?
Jesus Salas: Many times she -- most of the time she took it in the room. There was times that she went in the kitchen.
Mr. Auchincloss: When Mr. Mesereau asked you if things kind of run themselves or keep running at Neverland when Michael is not there, who is it that makes the determination in general about how Neverland is run as a ranch? Who is it that makes the ultimate call?
Jesus Salas: Okay, for the place would be run, I mean, we have a staff. We have a ranch manager.
Mr. Auchincloss: Uh-huh.
Jesus Salas: And that's how we do it. I mean, that's how they used to do it. Just do it together.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who tells the ranch manager how he wants that place run?
Jesus Salas: On the major decisions, I guess it comes from L.A. also.
Mr. Auchincloss: Does Michael have anything to do with how he wants that place run?
Jesus Salas: I'm not sure if he has something to do with that, but he will tell you what he likes.
Mr. Auchincloss: When Mr. Jackson is on the property, do the employees act differently?
Jesus Salas: No. They shouldn't.
Mr. Auchincloss: There's no difference between when he's on the property or off the property?
Jesus Salas: No, because the place needs to run the same way whether he's there or not.
Mr. Auchincloss: But isn't Neverland Ranch run exactly the way Michael Jackson wants it?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading and asked and answered.
Mr. Auchincloss: Offered as impeachment.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who is the person who ultimately makes the determination as to what happens at Neverland?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. It's been asked and answered a couple of times.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Let me back off, then, and go to -- okay, so sometimes someone in Los Angeles makes the decision, right?
Jesus Salas: Uh-huh.
Mr. Auchincloss: Who tells the person in Los Angeles what they want?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you ever seen guns on Neverland Ranch?
Jesus Salas: Not now, okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Not now?
Jesus Salas: Before, at the beginning, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: There were guns?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Tell me about it.
Jesus Salas: That was at the beginning when Mr. Jackson bought the place. Security was carrying guns.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there a period of time when guns were not kept -- not -- the security was not armed?
Jesus Salas: Yes, it came to the point that I guess Mr. Jackson didn't want any guns at the place, and nobody was carrying any weapons anymore.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did that ever change again?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there a time when a few people carried guns at Neverland?
Jesus Salas: Not that I was aware of.
Mr. Auchincloss: You said that when the Arvizo children were there, that Mr. Jackson was in constant meetings. You also said that he was constantly playing with the children.
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: So he was doing both of those things at the same time or --
Jesus Salas: Not at the same time. You know, when he was in meetings, he was in meetings. When he had some time free, he was playing with kids or he was by himself.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Who was he having these constant meetings with? Who was there when he was having these constant meetings?
Jesus Salas: Hard to remember. Many people.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. How about -- was Frank Tyson one of them?
Jesus Salas: Not really.
Mr. Auchincloss: But he did have meetings with Frank?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: You also said that Mr. Jackson was -- you answered some questions about him taking prescriptions, prescription medication.
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know the difference between somebody who is drunk and somebody who is taking some medication?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Auchincloss: Go ahead.
Jesus Salas: No, I guess I don't have a way of describing that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, were there times when you were serving Mr. Jackson alcohol when he appeared to be drunk?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And do you know how often Mr. Jackson would have alcohol?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague as to time.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll be specific.
Mr. Auchincloss: During this period in early 2003.
Jesus Salas: He was having a regular basis.
Mr. Auchincloss: Daily?
Jesus Salas: I said regular basis.
Mr. Auchincloss: Could you smell alcohol on him when you saw him during these periods he appeared to be drunk?
Jesus Salas: No, I never got so close to him to be able to smell.
Mr. Auchincloss: You said that Mr. Jackson's policy was not to let kids in the wine cellar. Was this a --
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was that a written policy?
Jesus Salas: That was a policy, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was that -- was it okay for kids to be in the wine cellar if he was there?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: I believe when he was there, I guess it was okay for the kids, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And did you testify that there were times when he was in the wine cellar with children?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; misstates the evidence.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll rephrase it.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were there times when he was in the wine cellar with children?
Jesus Salas: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: You have spoken to myself and various members of law enforcement in preparation for this case.
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Has anyone ever told you to tell anything but the truth?
Jesus Salas: That is correct, nobody did.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm sorry?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Thank you. No further questions.
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Just briefly. During the 20 years you worked at Neverland for Mr. Jackson, it was always his policy that children are not to be in the wine cellar, true?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jesus Salas: That is correct, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And Mr. Jackson sometimes would give people tours of his own home, correct?
Jesus Salas: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; beyond the scope.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: And obviously, as the owner of the home, he can take people anywhere he wants in his home, right?
Jesus Salas: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, when you were driving Janet to Los Angeles, she never asked you to call the police, did she?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When you arranged for the limousine to take the Arvizos to Los Angeles, they never asked you to call the police, did they?
Jesus Salas: No.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, she never asked you to call the police at any time, did she?
Jesus Salas: No, she didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions.
Mr. Auchincloss: Nothing further.
The Court: All right. Thank you. You may step down.
Mr. Zonen: Your Honor, we'll call Jason Francia to the stand, please.
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, before we start, is there an instruction?
The Court: Yes.
Bailiff Narron: Step up to the chair. Remain standing and face the clerk.
Jason Francia: The clerk.
The Court: Raise your right hand, please.
Message: JASON FRANCIA Having been sworn, testified as follows:
Jason Francia: I do.
The Clerk: Please be seated. State and spell your name for the record.
Jason Francia: Jason Francia. And spell my last name? F-r-a-n-c-i-a.
The Court: Mr. Francia, I'm going to ask you to sit back with the bailiff just for a moment.
Jason Francia: Okay.
The Court: (To the witness) If you'll just have a seat while I instruct, please. (To the jury) Ah, I can see you again. (Laughter.)
The Court: Before -- I'm going to give you a special instruction now. One of the things I want to mention before I give you these special instructions, though, is that I know this daylight savings time is tough on us. I was noticing a few drooping eyelids along here. If you start, you know, feeling sleepy or something, hold up your hand, and maybe we'll stand up and stretch or something. It's really hard during these time changes, and I know that, so I just want you to know we can help you on that, too. Okay. I'm now going to instruct you on two different types of evidence which you may hear. One relates to a prior uncharged sexual offenses. And two relates to a prior conduct -- to prior conduct leading to possible uncharged sexual offenses. First, the instruction for the prior sexual offenses: If you find that the defendant committed a prior sexual offense, you may, but are not required to infer that the defendant had a disposition to commit sexual offenses. If you find that the defendant had this disposition, you may, but are not required to infer that he was likely to commit and did commit the crime or crimes of which he is accused. However, if you find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant committed a prior sexual offense, that is not sufficient, by itself, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the charged crime. If you determine an inference properly can be drawn from this evidence, this inference is simply one item for you to consider, along with all other evidence, in determining whether the defendant has been proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the charged crime. Unless you are otherwise instructed, you must not consider this evidence for any other purpose. Within the meaning of the preceding instruction, the prosecution has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant committed sexual offenses other than for which he is on trial. You must not consider this evidence for any purpose unless you find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant committed sexual offenses. If you find other crimes were committed by a preponderance of the evidence, you are nevertheless cautioned and reminded that before a defendant can be found guilty of any crime charged in this trial, the evidence of the whole must persuade you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of that crime. This is the second part of the evidence: You will hear evidence that is being introduced for the purpose of showing conduct of the defendant leading to possible sexual offenses other than that for which he is on trial. This evidence, if believed, may not be considered by you to prove that Mr. Jackson is a person of bad character or that he has a disposition to commit crimes. It may be considered by you only for the limited purpose to determine if it tends to show a characteristic method, plan or scheme in the commission of criminal acts similar to the method, plan or scheme used in the commission of the offense in this case, which would further tend to show the existence of the intent, which is a necessary element of the crime or a motive for the commission of the crime charged. For the limited purpose for which you may consider such evidence, you must weigh it in the same manner as you do all other evidence in this case. You are not permitted to consider such evidence for any other purpose. “Preponderance of the evidence” means evidence that has more convincing force than that opposed to it. If the evidence is so evenly balanced that you are unable to find that the defendant -- that the evidence on either side of an issue preponderates, your finding on that issue must be against the party who had the burden of proving it. You should consider all of the evidence bearing upon every issue regardless of who produced it. So, we are -- we have two possible types of evidence that you may hear, starting now. One relates to prior uncharged sexual offenses. That evidence, if the burden of proof - preponderance of the evidence is met - may be used to show a propensity to commit a similar crime. The second type of evidence that you may hear is evidence that -- of conduct leading up to possible sexual offenses. And that may not be used to show a propensity to commit a crime. It can only be used to show the things that I mentioned to you. I won't go through them again. Complicated, yes. I'll discuss it more with you later. It's just an advantage to have it given to you in advance of hearing the evidence.
Mr. Zonen: Was the witness sworn?
The Court: He was sworn. You may proceed.
Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: Mr. Francia, good afternoon. Sir, we've had to tell everybody so far that you need to stay fairly close to the microphone because it's hard to be heard in the far reaches of the courtroom otherwise. Tell me, how old are you at this time?
Jason Francia: 24.
Mr. Zonen: Where do you work? What kind of work do you do?
Jason Francia: I sell auto parts right now. And I run a mentoring program for kind of like the probation department. Probation department refers kids to me, to my organization, and we mentor them through them not being truants and not committing crimes again.
Mr. Zonen: Let's start with the auto parts, and then we can go to the other ones.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: What do you do in the auto parts store?
Jason Francia: I literally sell parts. If somebody comes to me with a car that's broken, and then they ask for advice, and I just sell them a starter or an alternator, or so on, so forth.
Mr. Zonen: You've been doing that for about how long?
Jason Francia: I did this prior, so six -- probably a little less than a year.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Let's go to the mentoring program. Who do you work for in the mentoring program?
Jason Francia: Pete Taylor. It's through a church that I belong to, but yet it's still its kind of own identity. It's Foursquare Youth Programs. That's the official title.
Mr. Zonen: And the nature of the work, by “mentoring”, what do you mean?
Jason Francia: I'm the lead mentor. And the ultimate goal is, let me see, the probation department kind of says these kids need to be mentored. They needed to go through three programs. Sometimes community service or community service, mentoring, or some sort of jobs program or something else. And I'm one of their steps to get off of probation. So what we try to do is match them up with a mentor, and that's my job, to try to match them up with mentors. And I take them out the first and third Saturdays of every month and we try -- just hang out with them and show them that there's something more to life than crime, or than ditching, or than partying, or than drugs, or than anything else. There's more to life. We show them there's Frisbee golf. I've showed the guys how to change the oil and change a tire. My wife is helping. And she shows them how to cook, make purses with the girls and --
Mr. Zonen: You've been doing this for how long?
Jason Francia: I've been doing this, this exact job, for about six months. This type of work for probably since I was 18.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. When you were 18, did you start some kind of an internship program dealing with this?
Jason Francia: Yeah, I have started an internship with Santa Maria Foursquare Church. Was -- and was pretty much training to be -- to work with junior high, to high school, to college-aged people. And I just -- I -- I wanted to be trained in that, because I have a passion for that, so I started that. I did that for about two and a half years with Santa Maria Foursquare Church.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever work as a youth pastor?
Jason Francia: Yeah. I did that in 2003 to 2004, from my understanding. I can't really remember right now. I'm kind of nervous, just to let you guys know.
Mr. Zonen: That's okay. What is a youth pastor?
Jason Francia: Well, I was a youth pastor. That was, I guess, my official title. But I worked with 13-year-olds to 25- or 26-year-olds. And pretty much -- it's kind of like its own little church within a church. And you work with junior high and high schoolers. And then what I try to do is address the collegers in a different format. And then I've had the college students help me with the junior highers and high schoolers. So just talk about ethics, God, morals, and doing good.
Mr. Zonen: You've been doing htis consistently since age 18?
Jason Francia: Yeah, pretty much.
Mr. Zonen: Tell us which church this is again, please.
Jason Francia: The one I was a youth pastor, I did that through Oceano Foursquare. It was really known as Kings Way a long time ago. But pretty much Oceano Foursquare.
Mr. Zonen: Mr. Francia, you've been living in the Santa Maria area for how long?
Jason Francia: In the Santa Maria area -- let me see. We moved up here in '88. Then I moved away when I graduated high school for like four months. And I'm still living here now.
Mr. Zonen: All right. You say “we” moved up here in '88. Who moved in '88?
Jason Francia: My mom and I. It was just me and my mom.
Mr. Zonen: Based on what you tell us is your age, can I assume you were born in 1980?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. What type of work did your mother do when you moved up here?
Jason Francia: She was working for Michael Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Is Michael Jackson in this courtroom today?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And could you --
Jason Francia: He's right there.
Mr. Zonen: By telling us what he's --
Jason Francia: He's the light-complected gentleman.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you. Could the record so reflect, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What type of work did your mother do for Michael Jackson?
Jason Francia: She was a personal maid. At first she was just a maid. And from my understanding, my mom's just a hard worker and she moved up.
Mr. Zonen: Was she his maid prior to moving up here to Santa Maria?
Jason Francia: I don't know if she was his full-on, like, personal maid and -- but she was, yeah. Yeah, she was his maid.
Mr. Zonen: From what period of time in Los Angeles was she working for Michael Jackson?
Jason Francia: I think '86. But my mom tells me '85. I have no -- it's around '86, '85. I don't know.
Mr. Zonen: When did you first meet Mr. Jackson?
Jason Francia: I was probably six. I think. Six or seven. And the reason I say that is just it was a long time ago.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever have occasion to go to his residence in Los Angeles?
Jason Francia: Yeah, the one in Encino, yeah. I went there probably a lot, like 10, 11, 12 times. I don't know. Often my mom -- it was just me and my mom, so a single mom and just me. She needed to babysit me pretty much, so we had nobody else; no dad, no brothers and sisters.
Mr. Zonen: Your father wasn't in the picture?
Jason Francia: Correct.
Mr. Zonen: And there was no other kids; is that correct?
Jason Francia: That is correct.
Mr. Zonen: During the time that you were living in Los Angeles before moving up to Santa Maria, from the time your mother began working for Mr. Jackson, tell us approximately how often you went to his residence.
Jason Francia: I'm sorry, can you repeat that?
Mr. Zonen: Tell us approximately how often you went to his residence.
Jason Francia: Throughout my whole life of my --
Mr. Zonen: While living in Los Angeles.
Jason Francia: Oh.
Mr. Zonen: Before moving to Santa Maria.
Jason Francia: I went to Encino. He owned a lot of stuff. But I -- there's an Encino, which is like the big mansion, and then there's the, like, apartment hideaway thing. I think I went to Encino, which is the big mansion, I don't know, about six, seven times.
Mr. Zonen: Did other members of the Jackson family reside at that location as well?
Jason Francia: Yeah. Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Can you tell us who lived there?
Jason Francia: Mom and dad, I know that. I think they lived above the garages. I think. That's where I met them.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Jason Francia: I think Janet lived there as well. By -- I don't know. Other than that, that's all I remember.
Mr. Zonen: We're talking about almost 20 years ago; is that correct?
Jason Francia: Correct. Yeah. That -- yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Did you go to a different location where Michael Jackson lived in the Los Angeles area as well?
Jason Francia: Yeah. In the Los Angeles area, yeah, like Hollywood.
Mr. Zonen: And can you describe that place for us?
Jason Francia: Yeah. It was -- it didn't have much furniture. It was probably the tenth floor, because you could look over pretty much a lot of Hollywood and Beverly Hills. I think it was Beverly Hills. Didn't have a lot of furniture. Had a train set. Had a couple toys, telescope. Kitchen. But just not a lot of furniture. It was like a condo pretty much.
Mr. Zonen: And the reason that you would go to that location?
Jason Francia: My mom had to clean everything. My mom was just a clean lady.
Mr. Zonen: Was she the only person cleaning his residence, as far as you knew?
Jason Francia: No, there was other maids. But from my understanding, just my mom did a kickin' job. She just did a really good job at cleaning, a really good job at working just as a whole. She was just a good worker.
Mr. Zonen: And there was nowhere to leave you when she went off to clean?
Jason Francia: Yeah. Sometimes she may -- she would leave me with my aunt, but my aunt had to go to work as well. Everybody in my family was workers.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Jason Francia: And even -- even -- shoot, even I helped my aunt at times.
Mr. Zonen: Now, on the occasions when you would go to the -- what was it called? The hideout or hideaway?
Jason Francia: Yeah, my mom called it “the hideout”.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know why?
Jason Francia: Probably because nobody knew about it. I don't think it was registered.
Mr. Mesereau: Calls for speculation.
Mr. Zonen: Withdraw the question.
Mr. Zonen: Did Mr. Jackson ever mention the name of that place to you in any of his conversations to you?
Jason Francia: I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Was that something you enjoyed doing, going to either of those two places?
Jason Francia: The mansion I did, just because of the arcade. I was young. It was fun. There was toys.
Mr. Zonen: Tell us about the arcade at the mansion.
Jason Francia: Shoot. It had an old karate game. It just had a lot of video games in there, and it was fun for kids. It was -- I think he even had a laser tag set. I don't remember. But he had a lot of stuff, a lot of toys.
Mr. Zonen: There was a lot that you could do while you were there?
Jason Francia: At the mansion, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: And you enjoyed doing that?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Jason Francia: I'm sorry?
The Court: Overruled. Go ahead. Next question.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: At the other place, the place in Los Angeles, the hideaway, was that something you enjoyed doing?
Jason Francia: Yes and no. There wasn't that many toys. My mom wouldn't let me go out anywhere else, and there wasn't that many toys. It was a condo, so it's not like I could play with the elevator all day long. There was not that many toys. There was just a train set. A train set gets boring. It just goes around in circles. And there wasn't that many toys.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever spend the night at either of those two locations?
Jason Francia: Encino -- the mansion I didn't, which is in Encino. And the hideaway we did, I believe, with my mom.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Do you know approximately how many occasions?
Jason Francia: I don't recall. I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: Were there beds or furniture there?
Jason Francia: I don't believe so. I think there was an L-shaped couch like one of those that you put in a corner. There was a chair. I know that, because -- stuff. There wasn't that much furniture.
Mr. Zonen: How old were you when you moved to Santa Maria?
Jason Francia: '88 or '89. Eight years old. Yeah. Because I stopped playing baseball. Played baseball for a little.
Mr. Zonen: When you moved to the Santa Maria area, what job did your mother have?
Jason Francia: She was -- I believe her title, from what she told me, was Michael Jackson's personal maid, and she had, like, all the keys. She was the best maid he had, I guess.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever go to Neverland?
Jason Francia: Yeah. Yeah, I did.
Mr. Zonen: Tell us approximately how old you were during that period of time.
Jason Francia: I think when it first opened, it was just -- I went there. They probably had a party there. How old was I? Probably around nine. Eight.
Mr. Zonen: Approximately how many times do you think you went to Neverland?
Jason Francia: Five, four. Five or four.
Mr. Zonen: Always with your mother?
Jason Francia: Yeah. There was no other way to get up there, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever spend the night at Neverland?
Jason Francia: Yes. With -- yeah, I remember distinctly, because I think I was hearing bats or something, on the ranch, or something, and I couldn't sleep, so -- but I was sleeping with my mom, like in the same room, in the same area with my mom, and, yeah. I couldn't sleep.
Mr. Zonen: Were you ever in Michael Jackson's bedroom?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: On how many occasions?
Jason Francia: Two, I think. Two. I'm pretty sure. Once -- one I know for sure, because we were all laying in the bed watching T.V.
Mr. Zonen: And who is “we were all”?
Jason Francia: Michael and a bunch of other kids.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Do you know how many?
Jason Francia: I don't. Seven. Six. But I don't -- I don't.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know any of the names?
Jason Francia: I'm really bad at names. Even to this day. I called you “Mark” earlier.
Mr. Zonen: That's not me.
Jason Francia: Yeah, I know.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know how old you were when your mother stopped her employment at Neverland?
Jason Francia: I'm thinking 11, because I was -- I remember hearing about -- I was playing in the pool, and she told me, “I quit”.
Mr. Zonen: You were playing in the pool where?
Jason Francia: At a friend's house, and when I was 11, I was friends with him.
Mr. Zonen: I'd like to go back to, if I could, please, the period of time in Los Angeles prior to moving up to Santa Maria. Was there ever an occasion that you were with Michael Jackson where something happened that made you feel uncomfortable?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did that happen more than once?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Do you have a recollection of these events?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Let's begin with the first one. What happened?
Jason Francia: Okay. Well, the first time that I felt uncomfortable with him was in the hideout, which is the place in Encino -- not in Encino, I'm sorry. In Hollywood. And -- shoot. I was seven and -- I don't know, at seven years old, I don't think -- okay. I may have not felt uncomfortable, but then now I think about it, that shouldn't have been done. But I didn't feel uncomfortable.
Mr. Zonen: What happened?
Jason Francia: I was sitting on his lap, and I was young, and I was small. I'm still thin. I was even thinner then. Sitting on his lap, watching T.V., which that's normal enough in itself. And then we -- I was kind of facing the T.V., and he was facing the T.V. as well, so my back was to his chest. And it was -- there was just one chair, and there wasn't much furniture in that hideout place. And I was just sitting there watching T.V., and so was he. I think we were watching cartoons. And he just started tickling me, which, cool, shoot, I was a tickle guy. I tickled him back, but still kind of from the back, kind of reaching around. And then we went to the floor, I think, but I can't completely remember right now. But we somehow got on the floor, tickling still, because I'm doing what -- these little kid things, you know, when you shimmy back and forth. And then I'm tickling and he's tickling, and I'm tickling and he's tickling, and it eventually moved down to -- to -- to my little private region when you're a little kid. I don't know if you want me to call it specifically something, but around my crotch area. And I didn't -- you know, you're seven. I didn't think it was wrong. Well, I did. Because he's tickling, but I'm laughing, and I'm tickling him back, trying to get him to stop, but then I'm tickling too much. I'm laughing too much. And eventually it stopped. I don't know how.
Mr. Zonen: Did he actually make contact with your genital area?
Jason Francia: Not skin to skin, but, yeah. Yeah, he was on my clothes, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know for approximately how long?
Jason Francia: Distinctly I can't remember. It was a while, though.
Mr. Zonen: By a little while, can you give us a sense of it?
Jason Francia: More than three minutes, less than 20. Less than ten minutes, I think.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Jason Francia: But a while. It was -- it was tickling. It didn't end soon. It didn't end fast.
Mr. Zonen: But the amount of time that his hand was actually in the region of your genitalia?
Jason Francia: I cannot remember.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. And you commented that this was not skin to skin touching; in other words, his hand directly on either your penis or testicles. Is that --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Zonen: That it was not directly on your genitalia; is that correct?
Jason Francia: Correct. It wasn't -- he didn't touch me. He was touching on top of the skin, but -- but not -- on top of my shorts, but still --
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember what you were wearing at the time?
Jason Francia: Probably shorts. I don't remember specifically. I think those orange shorts that my mom made me, because, again, we were poor, but my mom made me clothes. And I was always wearing shorts, always wearing shorts.
Mr. Zonen: And she had orange shorts that she had made for you?
Jason Francia: Yeah, there was orange shorts that she made for me. And then she -- yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Were they shorts you wore a lot?
Jason Francia: Probably, yeah. Because -- yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Did -- as you think back now, today, of course we're talking about quite some number of years ago, do you remember how you felt at the time this happened, if that was at all strange for you?
Jason Francia: You know, I don't. It was -- I don't remember. At seven, it probably -- well, I probably did think it was weird, but not super weird. Just because you're tickling, and it's -- but I guess that would be weird. My fault.
Mr. Zonen: Was there another instance?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Was that also at the hideout?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Tell us what happened, please.
Jason Francia: I was watching cartoons again, and probably in the same room, because I think there was only one room in that whole place. And we somehow -- I was somehow -- there was a sleeping bag involved. I don't know -- I think I was on top of it. And I was watching T.V., laying down on the ground, and Michael was pretty much behind me, like spooning me. I don't know how we got there. I was like eight, eight and a half. It was a little while after. And again with the tickling. But this time it wasn't as long, and I was -- well, I'm sorry. It was longer, but I wasn't laughing as much, I guess.
Mr. Zonen: You were in a sleeping bag, or on a sleeping bag?
Jason Francia: On, I think.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Jason Francia: On, not in.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Do you remember -- you said this was in the hideout?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Were there a number of rooms in the hideout?
Jason Francia: I think there was only one, I think. Yeah. I think there was only one, if I could -- hold on. Let me -- there was a rest room. There was a kitchen. There was a big main room. And there was a room off to the left, if you're looking out the window. Yeah, I think there was only one.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Where was your mother during this time?
Jason Francia: Probably cleaning. She was always cleaning.
Mr. Zonen: But --
Jason Francia: To this day she cleans.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know in what room at that point?
Jason Francia: No, I don't. I don't know.
Mr. Zonen: Was she in the room with you at the time?
Jason Francia: No, she wasn't, or else she probably would have kicked my butt or something.
Mr. Zonen: In the private -- in the prior event that you described, was your mother in the room at that time?
Jason Francia: No, she wasn't in the room.
Mr. Zonen: But if you were at the hideout, then she was there; is that a correct statement?
Jason Francia: Correct. Or sometimes she may have run down to get something to eat. Remembering now, there was a couple times that Michael actually asked her to get chips, or get something, or get something from downstairs, or maybe even from the lobby. That's what I'm thinking.
Mr. Zonen: What was downstairs? Was that a --
Jason Francia: I think there was probably like a restaurant or something downstairs, but I don't really -- I have no clue.
Mr. Zonen: But the apartment that you're describing is a single floor? There's no upstairs or downstairs to it?
Jason Francia: Oh, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: And this is a large building in Los Angeles?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: All right. When do you think was the last time that you had been to that building?
Jason Francia: When was the last time I was there?
Mr. Zonen: Yeah.
Jason Francia: I'm thinking nine, eight.
Mr. Zonen: Age eight or age nine?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Even after you moved up to Santa Maria?
Jason Francia: I believe so. Just because my mom had no one to leave me up in Santa Maria with. We -- new town.
Mr. Zonen: Let me go back to the second event. In the second event we're talking about, you were in a sleeping bag?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was there a bed in that room?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Zonen: Was that Mr. Jackson's bedroom; do you know?
Jason Francia: I don't know.
Mr. Zonen: Was there a television in that room?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was there more than one T.V. in that apartment, to your knowledge?
Jason Francia: I don't think so.
Mr. Zonen: Were you watching television at that time?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember if it was late at night or midday? Do you have any way of knowing?
Jason Francia: It may have been midday, but I don't know.
Mr. Zonen: Can you describe the building for us in general, in terms of how it was laid out?
Jason Francia: Almost like a typical apartment or a condo. You walk in the front door, there's a big living room. There's -- there's a telescope in there. There's a bunch of toys. There's a couch. And then there's the kitchen.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. The room that has the couch, is that the room where the sleeping bag was?
Jason Francia: No, the room that has the couch didn't have any furniture but the chair, I think. I'm pretty sure.
Mr. Zonen: And now the sleeping bag itself, on the floor?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was it a normal-sized sleeping bag?
Jason Francia: I believe so. I would think so.
Mr. Zonen: You used the expression “spooning”. What does that mean?
Jason Francia: Something that you do with your wife. Something that you do with a girlfriend. Spooning. Like --
Mr. Zonen: Describe the position for us, if you would.
Jason Francia: Wow. When somebody is holding you and you're laying on your side and they're holding you from behind.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Jason Francia: Thanks.
Mr. Zonen: Was that the position that you were in with Mr. Jackson?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Were you in front or behind?
Jason Francia: I was in front.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember where his arms were?
Jason Francia: I couldn't specifically tell you.
Mr. Zonen: Was the tickling done again?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Was this something that you and Mr. Jackson did frequently, tickling?
Jason Francia: Whenever something happened.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. On this occasion, when he was tickling you, what happened?
Jason Francia: We were tickling -- oh, he was tickling me at first, and I was just watching T.V. Probably cartoons again. And he was just tickling me from behind, and in my genital area. And I was laughing, and I was trying to tickle him back. And -- go ahead.
Mr. Zonen: His hands made contact with your genitalia?
Jason Francia: From the top of the clothes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember what you were wearing on that occasion?
Jason Francia: Probably shorts again.
Mr. Zonen: Simply because you do?
Jason Francia: Simply because it's hot in L.A., yeah, and I always wore shorts. I think every picture I have -- well, not “every”, but there was a lot of pictures of me wearing shorts when I was younger.
Mr. Zonen: Are you mindful of his hand reaching your crotch at the time; you were thinking about that at the time?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Jason Francia: I don't even know what he asked me.
The Court: Just a moment.
Jason Francia: I don't understand, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you.
Mr. Zonen: Was it -- were you aware of it happening while it was happening?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And how long was his hand there?
Jason Francia: Two cartoons' worth. A cartoon and a half worth.
Mr. Zonen: And you were watching cartoons on television at the time?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: How long is a cartoon? It's been a while since I've seen one.
Jason Francia: It's been a while for me, too. Does anybody here watch cartoons?
Mr. Zonen: Tell us the best of your recollection. We can't let them be witnesses at the moment.
Jason Francia: A “Woody Woodpecker” I guess would last four, five minutes.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Jason Francia: Five, six minutes.
Mr. Zonen: So the contact in the area of your genitalia was at least four or five minutes?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Did it feel strange to you at the time?
Jason Francia: Yes and no. “No” because -- “no” because it's all fun, and it's supposed to be innocent, and you're a little kid, and you're having fun, and -- you're a little kid.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Jason Francia: And “yes” it's not right.
Mr. Zonen: Did Mr. Jackson ever give you money?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: On how many occasions did he give you money?
Jason Francia: Pretty much at every tickle thing there was money.
Mr. Zonen: Explain that, what you mean by that, “at every tickle thing there was money”. Explain what you mean, please.
Jason Francia: Every time I was being tickled, there was always some sort of money exchanged. Not exchanged. There was money given. It was just that.
Mr. Zonen: Before, after, during?
Jason Francia: After. And it was kind of a, “Don't tell your mom, about the money”.
Mr. Zonen: Well, what would he give you?
Jason Francia: A hundred-dollar bill.
Mr. Zonen: A hundred-dollar bill?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Did he do this on more than one occasion?
Jason Francia: Yeah, because I had a lot of money. Well, I didn't have a lot of money. My mom took the money, because she would find out that I got hundred-dollar bills, and then she'd get mad at me for taking some stranger's -- well, not stranger's, but somebody's money.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember if, in fact, you got the money on both of those two occasions?
Jason Francia: Yeah. Yeah, I did.
Mr. Zonen: Were there ever any other occasions, whether in Los Angeles or any other occasion or any other location where something happened that made you feel uncomfortable?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: And where was that?
Jason Francia: At the ranch.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember how old you were?
Jason Francia: Ten and a half, ten. I was older.
Mr. Zonen: And you have a recollection of this event?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: There's water there also, if you need anything.
Jason Francia: Oh, I was wondering. I thought it was coffee. I was hoping it wasn't.
Mr. Zonen: No, it's water. And feel free to take some if you need some.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: You think you were about ten or ten and a half?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: It was prior to the time that your mother quit her job there?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever go back to Neverland after your mother quit her job there?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember where this event took place, where at Neverland?
Jason Francia: What, the event?
Mr. Zonen: That made you feel uncomfortable.
Jason Francia: Yeah. It was in the arcade room. There was a loft area.
Mr. Zonen: Describe what the arcade is.
Jason Francia: A place where there's a bunch of video games, and there was a pool table, and I think there was a fireplace. I think that was up in the loft. I think. That was a long time ago. But, yeah, it's Street Fighter, the original one, in there, and pool tables, and a couple of other video games.
Mr. Zonen: On what part of the arcade were you at the time this happened?
Jason Francia: I was in the loft.
Mr. Zonen: Upstairs?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Was anybody else up there with you?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Zonen: Was Mr. Jackson there?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: By “other people”, I mean other people than you and Mr. Jackson.
Jason Francia: It was just him and I.
Mr. Zonen: Do you recall approximately what time of day or evening it was?
Jason Francia: No. Nighttime.
Mr. Zonen: Was your mother working that day?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Were there ever occasions when you were at Neverland and your mother wasn't working?
Jason Francia: Yeah, when we'd have parties and stuff, but I think she'd still work, because she'd always walk around cleaning even though she wasn't dressed for it.
Mr. Zonen: Were there ever occasions when you were at Neverland and your mother was not there?
Jason Francia: No, she was always there.
Mr. Zonen: On this occasion, was your mother in the arcade?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Zonen: Was she working that day?
Jason Francia: Probably.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember where her assignment would have taken her? Did she go to specific locations?
Jason Francia: In the ranch?
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Jason Francia: At the ranch area. She was cleaning everything.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Jason Francia: She wasn't in the arcade.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. And what happened when you were in the arcade.
Jason Francia: In the loft?
Mr. Zonen: Yes, please.
Jason Francia: I think I was playing Sega Genesis.
Mr. Zonen: Tell us what that is, please.
Jason Francia: It's -- it's a video game. I was just a video-game-playing kid.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Jason Francia: There was a video game. There was a T.V. up there, I believe. It was a really big T.V., and I was playing, and then he started tickling me, and I think there was -- there was a couch up there, because we somehow managed to end up on the couch. It took a lot of counseling to get over, just to let you know.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Move to strike; nonresponsive.
Jason Francia: I'm sorry.
Mr. Zonen: Let's see if we can restrict our answers just to the questions, if we can. I'll ask you some questions about that later. You were on the couch. Do you know if both of you were sitting on the couch?
Jason Francia: Hold on. We were laying down on the couch.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. How were you laying down? How were you positioned relative to Mr. Jackson?
Jason Francia: Probably about -- no, it was in the spooning position again.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Was he behind you or in front of you?
Jason Francia: Behind me.
Mr. Zonen: And then what happened?
Jason Francia: We were tickling -- well, he was tickling and I was laughing. And -- and -- and we -- it was -- he was -- he was tickling me in the.... So much happening right now. Can we take a break or something?
Mr. Zonen: Can we take just a moment, Your Honor?
The Court: Okay. Sure.
Mr. Zonen: Just a break for a moment or two?
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Jason Francia: All right.
Mr. Zonen: You were on the couch, and you said in the spooning position?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Tell us what happened, please, the best you can.
Jason Francia: He was tickling me. And then I was wearing shorts again, I'm pretty sure, and, yeah, because he had to have reached under. We were tickling; I was laughing. He reached on my leg, and I'm still laughing, and he's tickling. And then he reached up and -- and to my privates, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Did he actually touch your --
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Touch you?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Did he touch your penis or your testicles?
Jason Francia: I think option two, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Your testicles?
Jason Francia: Yeah, that one.
Mr. Zonen: For what period of time?
Jason Francia: I don't remember. Three minutes, two minutes.
Mr. Zonen: Was it tickling?
Jason Francia: Probably, because I think I was still laughing. But, you know, it may have been the other hand.
Mr. Zonen: Were you mindful of it at the time? Were you aware at the time he was doing it?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What were you thinking at the time? You're now ten and a half years old. What were you thinking?
Jason Francia: “I should probably go”.
Mr. Zonen: How did it end; do you know?
Jason Francia: Either my mom -- I don't -- I don't remember how it ended.
Mr. Zonen: Do you have a sense of it?
Jason Francia: Huh-uh.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember getting up?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you think about it afterward?
Jason Francia: Yeah. No, well, not instantly right afterwards. You're ten. You don't want to think about that stuff.
Mr. Zonen: Was Mr. Jackson still giving you money at that time?
Jason Francia: That time I didn't get any money.
Mr. Zonen: Did you tell anybody about that right afterward?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you tell your mother, ever?
Jason Francia: No. I don't even think to this day she knows.
Mr. Zonen: All right. At some point in time this became known to somebody; is that right?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Who did you tell? Who was the first person you told about it?
Jason Francia: Probably God. But --
Mr. Zonen: Let's go to number two, then. Who was the second person?
Mr. Mesereau: Move to strike that comment, Your Honor. Nonresponsive.
The Court: Well, it's responsive. Overruled. Go ahead.
Mr. Zonen: Who else did you --
Jason Francia: Who did I tell? I forgot their names, but there was two detectives. Yeah, I told those two guys.
Mr. Zonen: Before or after your mother had quit her position at Neverland?
Jason Francia: She had already quit.
Mr. Zonen: All right. At some point in time police came to you and said they wanted to talk to you; is that right?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Jason Francia: This is going to be hard for me to get through. Sorry.
The Court: Okay. The objection is overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Zonen: Go ahead.
Jason Francia: Yeah, they wanted to come and talk to me. I was 13. I was in eighth grade, I think. Yeah. I -- yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Around 1993?
Jason Francia: Yeah. It was '93, I think, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know in advance that they wanted to speak with you?
Jason Francia: No. Not until the big day that this crappiness started.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. At some point in time, they showed up?
Jason Francia: Yeah. They showed up probably around 4:00, because I had judo practice at, like, 6:00.
Mr. Zonen: So it was about -- I'm sorry, you had judo practice afterward?
Jason Francia: Yeah, I had to go to judo practice right after, and I don't think I went because I was crying.
Mr. Zonen: So you think it was about four o'clock in the afternoon?
Jason Francia: I think they came around four o'clock.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember how many people came?
Jason Francia: I think two. But I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: Was your mother present during the course of that interview?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know if that interview was tape-recorded?
Jason Francia: Yeah, it was tape-recorded because I listened to the tapes.
Mr. Zonen: You listened to it recently?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know if a transcription had ever been prepared of that interview?
Jason Francia: A trans -- yeah, it has been.
Mr. Zonen: And did you, in fact, review that transcription as well?
Jason Francia: Yeah. While I was reading it, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: The people who were present during the course of that interview, you and how many detectives?
Jason Francia: Two. Two detectives. Me and two other guys.
Mr. Zonen: They were both men?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Had you ever -- did you know them prior to that time?
Jason Francia: No. No.
Mr. Zonen: Have you seen either one of them since?
Jason Francia: Yeah, I just bumped into one outside. We were talking a while. I was waiting for -- to be called up here.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Just today, right before you testified you saw one of them?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Did you recognize him?
Jason Francia: No, I didn't. He said, “You probably don't remember me”. And I said, “No”. And he told me who he was. And then I was like, “Hey, that was you”.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know where they were from, the agency?
Jason Francia: The police?
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Zonen: At the time that you were having that conversation?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Zonen: I don't mean now, but at the time you had the conversation with them.
Jason Francia: No, I just knew they were police officers.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know they were tape-recording it at the time?
Jason Francia: Yeah, because he showed me and -- he showed me the tape-recording. And the tape-recorder was sitting right in front.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know what it was all about at the time you sat down at the table with them?
Jason Francia: I knew it was about Michael Jackson just because it was on T.V. all the time, and -- yeah.
Mr. Zonen: So there was already something going on in the news; is that correct?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Did your mother know that you were entering an interview with them?
Jason Francia: Yes. She had to have let me go.
Mr. Zonen: All right.
Jason Francia: My mom knew where I was at all times.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember where you were for this interview?
Jason Francia: Yeah. At the juvenile hall, or the sheriff's department.
Mr. Zonen: So it was over in the -- in where, in Santa Maria?
Jason Francia: Yeah, in Santa Maria. Well, in Orcutt, but -- yeah, in the sheriff's department.
Mr. Zonen: Do you recall how long that conversation was?
Jason Francia: I don't recall. An hour, hour and a half.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And that's consistent with your having reviewed that tape-recording as well?
Jason Francia: Right. Right.
Mr. Zonen: And your mother did know that you were going to be there; is that right?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was she at the building at the time you were there?
Jason Francia: I don't think so. I think she was in our little studio apartment still.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. In the course of that interview, did you discuss with them what had happened to you?
Jason Francia: Let me drink some water.
Mr. Zonen: Go ahead.
Jason Francia: Pump?
Mr. Zonen: It's confusing. There's a button on the top.
Jason Francia: I'm not a coffee drinker, sorry. It's a coffee thing, I think. I'm sorry. What was the question again?
Mr. Zonen: Did you discuss with the detectives what had happened to you with Mr. Jackson?
Jason Francia: Yes. Eventually. But at first I didn't want to. I was fighting it with everything that I could.
Mr. Zonen: Why?
Jason Francia: Because it's embarrassing. It's embarrassing now, and I'm 24 years old.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Was it harder then, at age 13?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Relevance; move to strike; leading.
The Court: Sustained; stricken.
Mr. Zonen: Ultimately --
Jason Francia: It was difficult for me.
Mr. Zonen: -- did you disclose to them the information that you gave us today?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: At some point in time, did you have an interview or were you represented by a private lawyer?
Jason Francia: At some point, yeah, in time I was.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember the name of that lawyer?
Jason Francia: Yeah, Terry -- Terry Cannon. And Kris Kallman.
Mr. Zonen: There were two lawyers who represented you?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know if -- was this after this interview?
Jason Francia: Yes, it was after this interview. It was like two months after this interview, I think.
Mr. Zonen: Were you ever called for a deposition?
Jason Francia: I was never called for a deposition.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever know a young man by the name of Jordan Chandler, or Jordie Chandler?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
Jason Francia: Did I --
Mr. Mesereau: Relevance; foundation; move to strike.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jason Francia: Did I ever meet him?
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Jason Francia: I probably did, but I -- I don't remember names. I'm really bad with names. And I'm not --
Mr. Zonen: Do you know if you were being prepared at any time to give a deposition in a case involving Mr. Chandler?
Jason Francia: No. What -- prepared by -- I don't know what you mean by “prepared”.
Mr. Zonen: Did your attorneys ever talk to you about the possibility of your going in and giving a deposition?
Jason Francia: No. I don't think so. I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: At some point in time, was there a settlement of some kind of a case involving you and Mr. Jackson? We're not going to get into the specifics of the amounts, but was there a settlement?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know if a lawsuit was ever actually filed?
Jason Francia: No. I don't think so, no. Because there was a settlement, so there was no lawsuit.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you have anything to do with it? In other words, did you say anything one way or the other about asking to have money?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Zonen: But were you consulted in any way about what was going to happen on that?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Was -- did you go into counseling at this time?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: And --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
Jason Francia: Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Zonen: I think it's relevant.
Mr. Mesereau: And leading.
The Court: I'll allow the question. The question and answer was, “Yes”.
Mr. Zonen: For what period of time did you stay in counseling?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Relevance; 352.
Mr. Zonen: I believe it's appropriate under People vs. Bledsoe and Shirley.
The Court: Go ahead. I'll allow the question.
Mr. Zonen: For what period of time did you stay in counseling?
Jason Francia: Shoot, like a week after the sheriffs interviewing me, or police, or whoever they were. And --
Mr. Zonen: That's when it started?
Jason Francia: Till I was 18, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Till you were 18?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Mr. Francia, recently have you been under surveillance?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Relevance; 352.
Jason Francia: We might be going there. I don't know.
The Court: I'm not sure what the relevance is. Do you want to approach?
Mr. Zonen: Yes, I think so. (Discussion held off the record at sidebar.)
The Court: Looks like it's time for our afternoon break.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: For the record, the objection was sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Mr. Francia, you stated earlier, you gave the statement, “When all this”, and I think you used the word “crappiness began”. What were you referring to?
Jason Francia: I guess coming out with it. Just because I had hidden it, and it was stowed away in a far off place. And that's what I meant. It was time for it to come out.
Mr. Zonen: Were you aware of your mother going on television at some time back in 1993 or '94?
Jason Francia: I knew about it when she was finally on T.V., yeah. I -- she told me --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Were you consulted about that prior to --
The Court: They can't hear. Who didn't hear back there? Counsel here?
Mr. Zonen: Is it on or off? I can't tell. Is it on? It's on.
Mr. Zonen: Were you consulted by anybody prior to your mother going on television?
Jason Francia: Was I?
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Did it cause you problems when that happened?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: And in what way?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
Jason Francia: It made --
The Court: Sustained.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: I have no further questions.
Jason Francia: Can I get a jacket? It's cold over here. I think I heard them say it's cold, too. Thanks.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Good afternoon.
Jason Francia: Hi.
Mr. Mesereau: My name is Tom Mesereau, and I speak for Michael Jackson.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: If anything I ask you is not clear, please don't answer. Just say, “I don't understand it”, okay? And I'll try to rephrase it. If you ever want to take a break, just say so, and if Judge Melville lets you, you can. But I don't want you to answer anything I ask you unless it's very clear to you what I'm asking you and you feel like you can answer it, okay?
Jason Francia: Sounds good.
Mr. Mesereau: So you know who I am, I'm on his side, okay?
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: We've never met before, right?
Jason Francia: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And we've never spoken before, right?
Jason Francia: I don't think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, the prosecutor mentioned the fact that your mother, at one point many years ago, went on the television show Hard Copy, right?
Jason Francia: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point you learned about that, right?
Jason Francia: At some point I learned about what?
Mr. Mesereau: Your mom going on the television show Hard Copy?
Jason Francia: At some point I learned about it, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And at some point you learned that she took $20,000 to go on the T.V. show Hard Copy, correct?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know anything about that?
Jason Francia: I do not.
Mr. Mesereau: You've never heard that to date?
Jason Francia: I have heard of it today.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you first learn that your mother have gone on the T.V. show Hard Copy and accepted $20,000?
Jason Francia: Right now. Well, it may actually -- two days ago, I think.
Mr. Mesereau: You never knew it until two days ago?
Jason Francia: That is correct. The reason....
Mr. Mesereau: Now, at some point, your mother met with someone from The National Enquirer, right?
Jason Francia: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know anything about that?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you first learn that your mom had gone on the T.V. show Hard Copy to talk about Mr. Jackson?
Jason Francia: When did I first learn --
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: -- that my mom went on T.V?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: On Hard Copy?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: I think it was when I saw it on T.V.
Mr. Mesereau: And that would have been when?
Jason Francia: I have no clue.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you have any idea what year?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Does more than ten years ago sound right to you?
Jason Francia: If you told me five years ago, I'd say okay. This whole past -- all these incidents, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, your mother at some point retained lawyers to represent you and she, correct?
Jason Francia: I don't know if she got them. I don't think she did.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you were a -- really a little boy, right, when lawyers were suddenly with you?
Jason Francia: I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: Weren't you very little, very young, when lawyers started appearing?
Jason Francia: I was young when all of this stuff happened, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How old do you think you were when you first met a lawyer involving Mr. Jackson?
Jason Francia: Were those two detectives lawyers?
Mr. Mesereau: No. No, they're with the sheriff's --
Jason Francia: They're just detectives?
Mr. Mesereau: And you met them recently, haven't you?
Jason Francia: No, I just met one of them right outside.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. One of the two detectives that first talked to you?
Jason Francia: Yeah. We were talking about life.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, when you first met them, you knew they were with law enforcement, right?
Jason Francia: When I first met them?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: I don't really know who they -- no, I don't -- I didn't think -- yes. I don't know. I didn't understand the question I guess.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Just tell me if you don't understand a question.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You learned at some point your mother went on Hard Copy, correct?
Jason Francia: I learned at some point that my mom went on Hard Copy.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: And you saw it on T.V., right?
Jason Francia: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point you learned that your mother accepted $20,000 to be on Hard Copy, correct?
Jason Francia: You already asked that.
Mr. Zonen: And I so object as asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you first, if you remember, talk to a lawyer about anything Mr. Jackson allegedly did?
Jason Francia: What he -- when did I tell somebody or tell the lawyer? Repeat that.
Mr. Mesereau: Yeah, when did you first meet a lawyer to talk about your claim regarding Mr. Jackson's behavior?
Jason Francia: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately when it was?
Jason Francia: I think the only -- I don't think I ever told Terry or Kris if he molested me or not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, Terry is who?
Jason Francia: Terry?
Mr. Mesereau: Terry is the lawyer?
Jason Francia: Terry is a lawyer.
Mr. Mesereau: That's Terry Cannon, correct?
Jason Francia: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And Kris is who?
Jason Francia: Kris -- I forgot his last name. He's a lawyer.
Mr. Mesereau: You mentioned him in response to the prosecutor's questions. Didn't you say Kris was a lawyer?
Jason Francia: I don't remember the prosecutor's questions.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you have a lawyer named Kris?
Jason Francia: Right now? No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever had a lawyer named Kris?
Jason Francia: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know Kris's last name?
Jason Francia: That's what I just said. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, did I hear you just say you never told either lawyer that you had been molested?
Jason Francia: I don't -- I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: Did I hear you just say that you never told either lawyer you'd been molested?
Jason Francia: I said I didn't know. That's what I said.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the lawyers you didn't know?
Jason Francia: No, I told you I didn't know.
Mr. Mesereau: You told me you didn't know whether or not you had told any lawyer you'd been molested, right?
Jason Francia: Not any lawyer.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I'm not understanding you.
Jason Francia: I'm not understanding you either.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase the question.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever tell Attorney Terry Cannon you'd been molested?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you ever tell Attorney Kris you'd been molested?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Approximately when did you do that?
Jason Francia: I don't remember. I was young.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately what year it would have been?
Jason Francia: I'd go with '94 or '93 or '95.
Mr. Mesereau: And how old were you in '93?
Jason Francia: I was 13. Well, yeah. My birthday's May 30th, so --
Mr. Mesereau: How old were you when you claim Mr. Jackson first tickled you improperly?
Jason Francia: Seven and a half the first time.
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to object as vague when we're referring to the claim or the tickling.
Mr. Mesereau: I think I was -- I'll rephrase it if the Court wants me to. I think I was clear.
The Court: The objection's overruled. The answer was given.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you telling the jury that at some point -- excuse me. Let me start again. As of today, you're telling this jury you've never told your mother what you claim Mr. Jackson did to you, right?
Jason Francia: I believe in counseling. I never told her specifics on -- that I was molested, but I did in counseling tell her that I was molested.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Jason Francia: But it was in -- shoot. It was a crying time for --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I'm not asking you about the details. Just answer my questions.
Jason Francia: It was just hard for me to remember because I was crying.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Jason Francia: So -- I was young, and I was 14 or 15.
Mr. Mesereau: So when you told the jury earlier that you never told your mother about this, that wasn't true, right?
Jason Francia: I'm sorry, I probably spoke quickly.
Mr. Mesereau: So when you told that to the jury, that was not really correct, right?
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to object as vague. What is “not”, or “that”?
The Court: The objection's overruled. I'll have the court reporter read the question back to you.
Jason Francia: Okay.
The Court Reporter: So when you told that to the jury, that was not really correct, right?
Jason Francia: And when I told “that” being --
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase it. When you told the jury, in response to the prosecutor's questions, that you had never told your mother you were molested, that wasn't true, right?
Jason Francia: I was mistaken.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. In fact, you had told your mother that you were molested, right?
Jason Francia: Yeah, I must have misunderstood his question with the -- with the details of it. I never told my mom that I was molested three times by Michael Jackson. My mom, I don't even think to this day, knows that I was molested three times and the specifics of it. If she does, then she does, and that sucks.
Mr. Mesereau: Your mother went on the T.V. show Hard Copy in the early '90s, right?
Jason Francia: Okay. I --
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know if that's true?
Jason Francia: She was on Hard Copy.
Mr. Mesereau: She was on Hard Copy in 1993, was she not?
Jason Francia: If you told me '94, I'd agree. I don't know. I don't know the exact year. I do not.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you telling the jury that before your mother went on Hard Copy, you never discussed what you claim Mr. Jackson did to you with your mother?
Jason Francia: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that I never told my mom that he molested me before Hard Copy.
Mr. Mesereau: And before sheriffs came to talk to you for the first time, had you told anyone that you had been molested by Michael Jackson?
Jason Francia: I don't think so, no.
Mr. Mesereau: They just kind of came one day and surprised you? (Laughter.)
Jason Francia: Yeah.
The Court: Just a moment, Counsel. (To the audience) I'm not going to put up with that.
Jason Francia: Thanks.
The Court: If there's any laughing again, I'll remove people from the courtroom. Go ahead, Counsel.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: You have -- you all right?
Jason Francia: Yeah. I was just a little tense. Sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: You have reviewed the tape and transcript of your first interview with the sheriffs, correct?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did you review that interview?
Jason Francia: Like when did I listen to the tapes again? Is that what you're asking?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: Sunday.
Mr. Mesereau: And how did you get the tape?
Jason Francia: Chris - I don't know his last name - gave them to me.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that the lawyer?
Jason Francia: No. He's not a lawyer, I don't think.
Mr. Mesereau: Is he a sheriff?
Jason Francia: It's a tall man.
Mr. Mesereau: Is he a sheriff?
Jason Francia: I don't know. I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you run into him?
Jason Francia: I met him when I met all these gentlemen.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutors?
Jason Francia: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So Chris was with the prosecutors when you met them last, right?
Jason Francia: I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: Chris was with the prosecutors when you spoke to the prosecutors, correct?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And Chris gave you a tape of your interview from 1993, correct?
Jason Francia: I believe that's the year, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And if you remember, who was at that interview in 1993?
Jason Francia: I don't remember. Two men. Detectives, I believe.
Mr. Mesereau: And where did it take place?
Jason Francia: I already answered that to him.
Mr. Mesereau: Would you please answer it again for me? Where did it take place?
Jason Francia: At the sheriff's station, or the probation -- I think it was the sheriff's.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that in Santa Maria?
Jason Francia: In Orcutt.
Mr. Mesereau: In Orcutt, okay. You were given a copy of the tape to listen to, right?
Jason Francia: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were given a transcript of the tape to read, right?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And you did that, right?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And a Detective Russell Birchim from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department was present for that interview, right?
Jason Francia: I don't remember his name.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you a copy of the transcript?
Mr. Zonen: I'll object as to which interview. Talking about the 1993 one, or the recent one where he reviewed the transcript?
Mr. Mesereau: I'm talking about the 1993 one.
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: Let's get back to the 1993 interview.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You have recently reviewed a transcript of that interview, right?
Jason Francia: In the '93 interview?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: The tape and the transcript?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: Have I reviewed them both?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: Didn't I answer you that already?
Mr. Mesereau: Would you please clarify it? Because there's been some confusion.
Jason Francia: Yes, I have.
Mr. Mesereau: You have listened to the tape and you've read the transcript, right?
Jason Francia: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: But as you sit here today, you're not sure who was at the interview with you in 1993, right?
Jason Francia: I was 13 years old.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you a copy of the transcript with the names of the people who were with you?
Jason Francia: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that transcript? Mr. Francia, have you had a chance to look at the transcript I just showed you?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did it refresh your recollection about who was there for that interview?
Jason Francia: Yeah. I just read it. It said Vince and Russell.
Mr. Mesereau: Vince Neglia and Russell Birchim, right?
Jason Francia: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Now, did someone tell you to review that transcript before you testified?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Who told you to review that transcript before you testified?
Jason Francia: I'm under some pressure. Mark -- it's not Mark. It's Russ. I'm so bad with names.
Mr. Mesereau: Is it Prosecutor Zonen, who just asked you questions?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Did he tell you you'd be asked questions about that?
Jason Francia: About --
Mr. Mesereau: What you said in that interview in 1993?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did he tell you to study it carefully and make sure you knew what you said and didn't say, right?
Jason Francia: Actually, he didn't say, “Study it carefully”.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he tell you to read it?
Jason Francia: He told me to review it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Now, you were how old when you were interviewed in 1993?
Jason Francia: I think on that, it says the date. I could tell you the -- I could tell you how old I was.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. The date was November 4th, 1993.
Jason Francia: I was 13.
Mr. Mesereau: 13. Okay. Is that the first time you were ever interviewed by any police officer regarding Michael Jackson?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you told the police that you and Mr. Jackson were talking to one another in that hideout area, right?
Jason Francia: I -- I was kind of banging my -- I told the police that I was --
Mr. Mesereau: Talking to Mr. Jackson at a place you described as the hideout.
Jason Francia: Yes, I have talked to Jackson at the place, at the hideout.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was a place where Mr. Jackson used to go when he didn't want the public or the press or anyone knowing he was there, true?
Jason Francia: I'm assuming that.
Mr. Zonen: Objection as speculative.
The Court: Just --
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. Jackson ever tell you --
The Court: I haven't ruled on it.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, I thought you had, Your Honor. Sorry.
The Court: I'll allow the question, and the answer was, “I assume that”. Go ahead, Counsel.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. Jackson tell you that this was a place that he didn't want the public or the press following him to?
Jason Francia: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. In that interview, you told the police that you were sitting on Mr. Jackson's lap, right?
Jason Francia: I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: In that interview, you told the police you were sitting on Mr. Jackson's lap, correct?
Jason Francia: In the '93 11 -- is that this one that you're reviewing right now?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: The one you showed me? Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. And you told them that at one point, he started tickling you and you started tickling him, right?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And then you told the police, “I have this blackout. I can't remember anything else”, right?
Jason Francia: Yeah. I -- I tried to black everything out.
Mr. Mesereau: I understand. But I just want to go forward and ask you some questions about it.
Jason Francia: Oh, okay.
Mr. Mesereau: But on that particular date, you told the police that you had blacked everything out after you and Mr. Jackson started tickling, right, tickling each other, correct?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the police you knew that Michael Jackson had a reputation of being nice to kids, right?
Jason Francia: I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: You told the police that Mr. Jackson had a reputation for being very nice to kids, right?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you tell the police about Mr. Jackson's reputation?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; irrelevant.
Jason Francia: I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: And hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You were in that apartment because your mother brought you there, right?
Jason Francia: My mom did bring me there to the hideout.
Mr. Mesereau: She brought you there and she was working in the apartment, correct?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And how many rooms do you remember there being in that apartment?
Jason Francia: I remember one, but I could be mistaken.
Mr. Mesereau: The first time you claim you were improperly tickled, was that on a chair?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was when your mom was cleaning the apartment, correct?
Jason Francia: She wasn't in the room.
Mr. Mesereau: She wasn't in the room then?
Jason Francia: She was not in the room with me.
Mr. Mesereau: You sure of that?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you told the police you had a blackout and didn't remember anything after -- after you and Mr. Jackson were tickling each other, right?
Jason Francia: I blocked it out. I didn't blank it out. I just didn't never want to repeat that stuff again.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember, in one of your police interviews, the police telling you, “This is what happened, right?” And you said, “Well, I'll have to work on that”? Do you remember using words like that?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Have you looked at the transcripts of both your police interviews?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Just looked at the one in '93?
Jason Francia: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Now, you told the police you didn't want to sit on the floor, right?
Jason Francia: I don't know what you're talking about right now.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever tell the police you wouldn't want to sit on Mr. Jackson's floor?
Jason Francia: Are you talking about the hideout?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: I -- yeah, I remember -- I don't remember saying that. I remember hearing that on the tape.
Mr. Mesereau: You did hear it on the tape, right?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And it's your voice, right? Right?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the police.... Let's talk about the first incident you claim happened, okay?
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you claim you both were clothed, correct?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You claim you were sitting in Mr. Jackson's lap, right?
Jason Francia: On one leg, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you claim he started tickling you, right?
Jason Francia: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: You tickled back, correct?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were watching cartoons, right?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you ever watched cartoons with Mr. Jackson before?
Jason Francia: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you ever watched cartoons with him in Encino?
Jason Francia: I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: Had you ever watched cartoons with Mr. Jackson in Encino?
Jason Francia: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember either Mr. Jackson tickling you or tickling him at the home in Encino?
Jason Francia: I don't remember any of that in Encino.
Mr. Mesereau: Where was your mother, if you know, when you say you were improperly tickled?
Jason Francia: I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Did she come back at some point?
Jason Francia: I had to have left there with my mother, so I think she did.
Mr. Mesereau: And how old were you on that particular day?
Jason Francia: I answered that already, and I thought seven and a half. Seven, eight.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You told the jury that you tickled each other and then you went to the floor and you don't remember after that, correct?
Jason Francia: I don't remember after what?
Mr. Mesereau: You went to the floor.
Jason Francia: I don't remember after he was playing with my balls.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, that's what you said later on. Earlier interviews you denied that, didn't you?
Mr. Zonen: I think we're vague now.
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: I'll object as vague.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Early in your interviews, you denied being touched in your private areas, didn't you?
Jason Francia: Yeah. I was scared.
Mr. Mesereau: They were pretty long interviews, weren't they?
Jason Francia: I believe so. Yeah, they were. They were long in my time. To a kid, an hour's a long time.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember in your first police interview in 1993 telling the police, “I'll just say this out flat. I don't remember him trying anything with me except for the tickling”? Do you remember that?
Jason Francia: Do I remember saying that?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: No. But I've heard that on the voice. Yeah, I was fighting them with everything I had.
Mr. Mesereau: I understand. I understand. You told the police that at that apartment there was a humongous T.V., right?
Jason Francia: In what apartment?
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Jackson's apartment, where you say you were improperly tickled, right?
Jason Francia: The hideout?
Mr. Mesereau: That's what you call the hideout. I'm calling it the apartment. You call it the hideout, right?
Jason Francia: Okay. My mom called it the hideout. That's why I called it the hideout.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the police in 1993 there was a humongous T.V., right?
Jason Francia: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: You said, “It was 46-inch, something like it”?
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to object as to hearsay.
Jason Francia: I don't know.
The Court: Just a moment. Sustained. You need to wait until I rule on the objection.
Jason Francia: Oh, sorry.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling the police in that interview, “We started tickling each other and my mom just grabbed me and, 'Let's go'”?
Jason Francia: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you a page of it?
Jason Francia: Probably would.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: You may.
Mr. Zonen: What page?
Mr. Mesereau: It would be page 26.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you.
Jason Francia: Okay. I see that.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that? Does it refresh your recollection about what you told the police in that interview?
Jason Francia: No, not really.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, on a number of occasions, you told them, “We tickled each other and then I left”, didn't you, words to that effect?
Jason Francia: Yeah. Again, I was fighting with everything I had.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm not asking you what you were doing. I'm just asking if that's true, okay? On a number of occasions, you said, “We just tickled each other and then I left”, right?
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that correct?
Jason Francia: Yes. And then I also told them that he molested me.
Mr. Mesereau: On many occasions in that interview you denied being molested, didn't you?
Jason Francia: Yeah, at first.
Mr. Mesereau: And the police kept leaning on you to admit you had been molested, true?
Jason Francia: It wasn't like a twisting the arm. It was -- I was again fighting. I didn't want to be embarrassed at school. I didn't want to be embarrassed anywhere. I was 13.
Mr. Mesereau: So you were lying to the police?
Jason Francia: Yeah. I was at first.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, shortly after this -- let me rephrase that. How long after this did you and your mother get lawyers and threaten to sue Mr. Jackson; do you know?
Mr. Zonen: Objection as compound, “you and your mother”. And vague.
The Court: Sustained. Compound.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember in that interview being asked, “Is Mr. Jackson touchy-feely?” And you said, “I don't remember. I distinctly don't remember”?
Jason Francia: I don't remember that interview.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you that page?
Jason Francia: If you show me the page, I'm still not going to remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you've --
Jason Francia: I could -- if it says on the transcript, then I'll say, okay, I said it when I was younger. But I don't remember right now.
Mr. Mesereau: But you've listened to the tape and read the transcript to prepare for today, correct?
Jason Francia: This is pretty nerve-racking being here right now, so for me to say I'm prepared for this? I'm not prepared for this.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, I do have to ask you questions, you understand that?
Jason Francia: I totally understand.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you told police in that interview, they asked you if Mr. Jackson was touchy-feely, and you said, “I don't remember. I distinctly don't remember”. Remember that?
Jason Francia: Do I remember that? No, I don't remember that.
Mr. Mesereau: Might it refresh your recollection if I just show you that page?
Jason Francia: We just did this again.
Mr. Zonen: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Remember telling the police you just remember the tickling; it was fun?
Jason Francia: It was fun to be tickled, to laugh. That's fun.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. That's what you told the police in that interview, correct?
Jason Francia: What I'm telling you right now is that it's fun to laugh. I don't know what I told them.
Mr. Mesereau: Might it refresh your recollection if I just show you a page of transcript?
Jason Francia: I'll agree with it if it says it on there, but I -- to remember that all right now, I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the police Mr. Jackson never kissed you, right?
Jason Francia: I remember saying that. I remember hearing that on the tape.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told them that he just hugged you goodbye when you left with your mom, right?
Jason Francia: At first. I believe that's in the very beginning of the transcript.
Mr. Mesereau: You were asked if you had met Brooke Shields by the police. Do you remember that?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever meet Brooke Shields?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; irrelevant.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jason Francia: Heck if I know.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember whether or not Mr. Jackson was dating Brooke Shields at that point in his life?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; speculative.
The Court: You may answer.
Jason Francia: When I was --
The Court: The question is, do you know? Just “yes” or “no”.
Jason Francia: Okay. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, at this point, do you know whether or not you've ever obtained money from Mr. Jackson?
Jason Francia: One more time.
Mr. Mesereau: At this point in time, do you know whether or not you've ever obtained money from Mr. Jackson other than what you just described?
Jason Francia: Other than the money that he put down my pants?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: At some point you and your mother settled a case with Mr. Jackson, correct?
Jason Francia: I don't remember signing papers.
Mr. Mesereau: You're how old today?
Jason Francia: I'm 24.
Mr. Mesereau: And you're telling the jury you don't know whether you and your mother ever reached a financial settlement with Mr. Jackson?
Jason Francia: There was a financial settlement.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And when did you learn about that?
Jason Francia: I believe I was 17.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember signing documents in that?
Jason Francia: At 17, I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember looking at that agreement?
Jason Francia: At 17, I did not look at that agreement.
Mr. Mesereau: And now, at 17, you knew that your mother had already gone on television attacking Mr. Jackson, right?
Jason Francia: When she was on Hard Copy, is that what you're talking about?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: Yes. At 17, I heard she had already been on Hard Copy.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point she met with Attorney Larry Feldman, did she not?
Jason Francia: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But at 17, you certainly knew that your mother had hired attorneys who were threatening to sue Mr. Jackson if they didn't get some money, right?
Jason Francia: No, I do not.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't know anything about that at 17?
Jason Francia: Call me a stupid kid. I didn't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you certainly learned about it at some point?
Jason Francia: Yeah. I learned about it at some point.
Mr. Mesereau: Which did you learn about the fact that your lawyers were threatening to go public and sue Mr. Jackson unless you and your mother got money?
Jason Francia: All of that stuff I don't know about. I knew that there was a settlement. I don't know how they fought, or what they argued about, or what they talked about.
Mr. Mesereau: You've never discussed it with your mom?
Jason Francia: About -- I have never discussed what, the settlement?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: Yes, I have.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever discussed how the settlement came about with your mom?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. And do you remember reading a settlement document?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You were asked to sign a settlement document at some point, right?
Jason Francia: Probably.
Mr. Mesereau: And in that document, Mr. Jackson denied doing anything wrong, correct?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; assumes facts not in evidence.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know whether or not in that settlement document you signed Mr. Jackson denies ever doing anything wrong?
Mr. Zonen: Objection. No evidence he signed it, he viewed a document or signed a document.
The Court: The objection is sustained. He said -- when you asked him if he signed it, he said, “Probably”. So you haven't established that he signed it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: At the age of 24, and as you sit here today, you don't know if you ever signed a settlement document with Mr. Jackson?
Jason Francia: That is correct.
Mr. Mesereau: As you sit here today, at the age of 24, do you know if your mother ever signed a settlement document with Mr. Jackson?
Jason Francia: I think she did.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know if any money has come your way through a settlement with Mr. Jackson?
Jason Francia: Money has, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And when did you first learn about that?
Jason Francia: I answered that I thought. At 17.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you've had many discussions with your mom about that, right?
Jason Francia: No. We -- me and my mom have a weird relationship. Well, not a weird relationship. We just don't talk about much stuff.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember constantly telling the people who interviewed you in 1993 that you didn't remember Mr. Jackson doing anything improper?
Jason Francia: I don't remember now, but I -- in listening to the tapes, I remember when I was -- at first I was denying everything.
Mr. Mesereau: You've told the police that he tickled you, you tickled him, you both laughed, and then you went home, right, early in the interview?
Jason Francia: I think I told him that I blacked it out or -- yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And you told the police at one point as they tried to get you to say he had molested you, you said, “If I don't remember, I don't remember”, right?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: The police kept trying to tell you to say that Mr. Jackson put his hands somewhere that was improper, right?
Jason Francia: No, they didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember these long paragraph questions where they'd say, essentially, “Admit to us he did something improper”?
Jason Francia: They said, “If he did something, then tell us”. That's what I remember. You could give me that, and I'll read it.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you one of the paragraph questions they asked you?
Jason Francia: Well, this is -- I'm telling you what I remember. It's not going to change my memory.
Mr. Mesereau: It's not going to change your memory to look at the transcript?
Jason Francia: No. What I remember is them telling me, “If he did something, then tell us”. And I was, “No, I'm not gay”. I was fighting it again.
Mr. Mesereau: You repeatedly told them, “I have nothing to tell you. I don't remember anything”, right?
Jason Francia: I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: You repeatedly told them you had nothing to tell them because you didn't remember anything improper?
Jason Francia: In the very beginning, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Now, in your response to the prosecutor's questions about the first time you say you were improperly touched - okay? -
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: -- did you say words to the effect, “At some point we were on the floor”?
Jason Francia: I believe I did, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And then you said, in response to the prosecutor's questions, “I can't remember anything after that”, right?
Jason Francia: I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: After saying that you went to the floor, earlier today --
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: -- you then said, “I don't remember anything after that”, correct?
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to object as asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember anything that happened after you went to the floor during the first time you say you were improperly touched?
Jason Francia: Isn't that the same question that you just asked?
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, could the witness be instructed to respond?
Mr. Zonen: I'm not certain as to the --
The Court: Just a moment. (To the witness) The problem we have is you don't get to object to his questions. If the District Attorney wants to object, he can. If the District Attorney doesn't object, then you just answer the question.
Jason Francia: Okay.
The Court: Just a moment. I'll have the question read back.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Jason Francia: Sorry.
The Court Reporter: Do you remember anything that happened after you went to the floor during the first time you say you were improperly touched?
Jason Francia: After he touched me? Like in my genitalia?
Mr. Mesereau: Did you then go to the floor?
Jason Francia: I thought we were already on the floor.
The Court: You're asking him a different question.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you want the first question? Do you want the first question read back again? I'll start again, Your Honor.
The Court: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you were sitting in a chair with Mr. Jackson, right?
Jason Francia: Okay. I was on his lap, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you were tickling each other at one point, right?
Jason Francia: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: And at one point you said you went to the floor, correct?
Jason Francia: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you tickling each other on the floor, as far as you remember?
Jason Francia: As far as I remember, I believe so, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And there was a lot of laughing going on, right?
Jason Francia: Yeah. Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And then at some point your mom came back, right?
Jason Francia: Did I say that?
Mr. Mesereau: I'm just asking you.
The Court: Just answer.
Jason Francia: No, I'm literally asking you. No, I don't think I said that.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't she come back at some point and then take you home?
Jason Francia: She must have, yeah. She had to have taken me home.
Mr. Mesereau: In your interview in 1993, the police asked you if Mr. Jackson rubbed your penis, and you said, “No”, correct?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Right?
Jason Francia: In the beginning, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, pretty late in the interview, wasn't it?
Jason Francia: I have no clue.
Mr. Mesereau: You said, “It was a tickling. He didn't rub me there”, correct?
Jason Francia: Oh. Okay. If we're going that --
Mr. Mesereau: Is that right?
Jason Francia: Yeah, he was playing with my stuff, not rubbing it. In a stroking manner.
Mr. Mesereau: I know the point you're trying to make to the jury, but I'm just asking you the facts, okay?
Mr. Zonen: I think that's argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You told the police that, “He never rubbed me there. It was just a tickling”, correct?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jason Francia: One more time.
The Court: I'll have the court reporter....
The Court Reporter: You told the police that, “He never rubbed me there. It was just a tickling”, correct?
Jason Francia: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you a transcript?
Jason Francia: I don't remember. I'll say I don't remember, but I'll agree with what the transcript says.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. Would you like to look at it?
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: All right.
Mr. Zonen: What page, Counsel?
Mr. Mesereau: 45.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that transcript?
Jason Francia: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you told the police in that interview?
Jason Francia: No. But in reading it, it said, “Well, yeah” in the very beginning of that sentence.
Mr. Mesereau: It says, “Well, yeah, he's not rubbing it, but tickling”, right?
Jason Francia: That's what it said, I believe.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said it was on top of your pants; is that correct?
Jason Francia: The first time --
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: -- that he molested me?
Mr. Mesereau: The first time you say he molested you, you say it was on top of your pants, right?
Jason Francia: Pants or shorts. My clothing.
Mr. Mesereau: You said he never put his hands in your shorts, right?
Jason Francia: Right now? Do I say he never -- no, he did it at the very end. The last time he molested me, he did put his hands in my shorts.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. We're talking about the first time.
Jason Francia: The first time he didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And how much time elapsed, if you know, between the first time you say you were touched and the second time?
Jason Francia: I'm guessing a year.
Mr. Mesereau: And how much time elapsed between the second time you claim you were improperly touched and the third time?
Jason Francia: I'm guessing two years.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So let me just, for the record, get your ages each time. The first time you were around seven, right?
Jason Francia: Sounds about right. Seven, seven and a half.
Mr. Mesereau: The next time you were around eight?
Jason Francia: Eight, eight and a half, or nine. Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And the third time you're how old, do you think?
Jason Francia: Ten, ten and a half.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did you have any contact with Mr. Jackson in between those three events you've described?
Jason Francia: I believe I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, let's talk about contact between the first event that you've described and the second. What kind of contact did you have with Mr. Jackson?
Jason Francia: Actually, between the first time he molested me and the second time he molested me, I don't think there was contact between those two times.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, has someone told you to make sure you use the word “molest” repeatedly in your testimony?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you discussed your testimony with any lawyer before you came in today?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Discussed it with your mom before you came in today?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Not at all?
Jason Francia: Me and my mom?
Mr. Mesereau: Yeah.
Jason Francia: I haven't -- no. I haven't talked to her much.
Mr. Mesereau: Does she know you're here today, to your knowledge?
Jason Francia: Yeah, I think she does.
Mr. Mesereau: You're not sure?
Jason Francia: I'm pretty sure she does.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Have you talked to her about it?
Jason Francia: About me coming on the stand?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: No, I have not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, the prosecutor asked you how long the tickling continued the first time, right?
Jason Francia: Okay. Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: But you didn't time how long the tickling continued?
Jason Francia: No, I didn't have a stopwatch.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't really know how long it continued, do you?
Jason Francia: I could go by Woody Woodpecker, but -- I could go by cartoons, but I didn't have a -- I probably did have a watch on, but I didn't time it.
Mr. Mesereau: You've told the police nothing happened skin to skin, right?
Jason Francia: At first.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you still say nothing -- there was no touching skin to skin --
Mr. Zonen: Objection.
Mr. Mesereau: -- in the first event, right?
Mr. Zonen: Withdraw the objection.
Jason Francia: Are we talking -- yes, we are talking the first event, so -- correct?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. No skin-to-skin touching, correct?
Jason Francia: Correct. I just sometimes get confused if you're talking first event, second event, third event.
Mr. Mesereau: Unless I say otherwise, let's assume I'm talking about the first event. Okay?
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, after that first event happened --
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: -- you claim you never told anyone about it, right?
Jason Francia: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: After the second event happened, you claim you never told anyone about it, right?
Jason Francia: After the second time it happened?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: Yes, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: After the third time it happened, you claim you never told anyone about it, and then suddenly the police came one day, right?
Jason Francia: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Between the first and the second event, how often did you see Michael Jackson?
Jason Francia: Between the first and the second?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Jason Francia: I thought I said none. I didn't think I saw him in between 1 and 2.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't see him at all?
Jason Francia: I don't think so. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I mean, your mother still was working for Mr. Jackson, right?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And she used to clean his house, right?
Jason Francia: Clean the mansion, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And would you go over to the mansion with her, still, from time to time?
Jason Francia: At times, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall seeing Mr. Jackson anytime after -- or excuse me, between the first and the second event?
Jason Francia: I don't recall it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. The second event you've described -- actually, let me go back to the first one. You said you don't remember how it felt, you were too young, right?
Jason Francia: I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: Yeah. Going back to the first event.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Correct me if I'm wrong, I think you said, “I don't remember how it felt. I was too young”, right?
Jason Francia: I believe that's what I said, yeah. When he was doing his interview or --
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me?
Jason Francia: -- when he was asking me the questions?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Yes.
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you don't recall -- excuse me. And the year you think that happened was when? When do you think?
Jason Francia: The first time?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please.
Jason Francia: I'm thinking '87, '88.
Mr. Mesereau: '87, '88?
Jason Francia: Yeah, around there.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. 17, 18 years ago, right?
Jason Francia: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Jason Francia: Well, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: You said that you've done some therapy, right?
Jason Francia: That I've gone through counseling, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. And without going into what you said, because that's confidential --
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: -- have you done anything, exercises or anything, to try and refresh your memory about what happened in '87 or '88?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And has any representative of the police department been involved in any of your counseling sessions?
Jason Francia: No, I don't think so. Well, there was the one time that the -- that I first met Mr. Sneddon, I think that's his name. And it wasn't a counseling session. But Mike Craft, which was my counselor, was there.
Mr. Mesereau: Was there with Mr. Sneddon present?
Jason Francia: I think he was there, but I was 13.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And to your knowledge, was Mr. Sneddon talking to your counselor?
Jason Francia: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. This is 12 years ago, approximately?
Jason Francia: In '93.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay.
Jason Francia: Or '94.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you don't know what your counselor or Mr. Sneddon said to each other, right? You wouldn't know?
Jason Francia: I wouldn't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know how long Mr. Sneddon and your counselor met?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; assumes facts not in evidence, that they met.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Jason Francia: I don't even know if they met. I don't even -- well, they had to have met because they were in the same room, if they were in the same room. But I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know where they were in the same room?
Jason Francia: Yeah, when they were in front of me.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know where that room was?
Jason Francia: Yeah, it was in where I got my counseling. It was my counselor's office.
Mr. Mesereau: So Mr. Sneddon came to your counselor's office, correct?
Jason Francia: That's what it -- I'm telling you this, because I think I remember meeting him there.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know if your counselor's been in touch with Mr. Sneddon?
Jason Francia: I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know if he's spoken to Mr. Sneddon at any time other than that day?
Jason Francia: I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. Now, the second time you claim you were improperly tickled, you said you were lying on top of a sleeping bag, correct?
Jason Francia: In or on, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you told the police it was on top. You were not in, right?
Jason Francia: I think it says that on the transcripts.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that was a large sleeping bag that took up most of the floor, correct, as far as you remember?
Jason Francia: I can't see a sleeping bag taking up the whole floor in a room, now, because it's gigantic. But I think I said that when I was younger.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember mentioning Steven Segall to the police?
Jason Francia: Yeah, I do.
Mr. Mesereau: And why did you Steven Segall?
Jason Francia: Why did I mention him? I don't know. Because I played pool against him, I think.
Mr. Mesereau: Was that with Michael Jackson?
Jason Francia: I think he was there.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was that at Neverland; do you know?
Jason Francia: I think it was -- yeah, I'm pretty sure it was at Neverland. It was at Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, in the second event that you've described, you also claim that there was no skin-to-skin touching, correct?
Jason Francia: On the second event, I don't -- yes, that is what I claim.
Mr. Mesereau: And what you said was that that also began like tickling, correct?
Jason Francia: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You were tickling each other, right?
Jason Francia: I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: You were tickling each other at that point?
Jason Francia: Yeah, it started off with him tickling me.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that was at the -- what you call the hideout as well, right, the second event?
Jason Francia: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Where was your mom at that point?
Jason Francia: I don't know. Not in the room.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. You're on the floor, and you're in that position you described, right?
Jason Francia: What -- when he's kind of spooning in and holding me? Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And he starts tickling you, right?
Jason Francia: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You tickle him back, right?
Jason Francia: Probably.
Mr. Mesereau: You're watching television, right?
Jason Francia: Probably, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Jason Francia: Yeah. Well, I mean -- I'm sorry. I am watching T.V., but I don't know whether I'm tickling him back or watching T.V.
Mr. Mesereau: You're both laughing, right?
Jason Francia: Probably.
Mr. Mesereau: And then you say at some point he improperly tickled you in your private area, correct?
Jason Francia: Yeah, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling the police it was -- it was no more than a 30-second thing?
Jason Francia: I don't remember that.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you a portion of the transcript of your police interview?
Jason Francia: It wouldn't. I could look at it again, but it wouldn't make me remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you want to give it a try?
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page?
Jason Francia: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you told the police?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't remember their asking you if it was just like a passing thing, and you said, “It's no more than a 30-second thing”?
The Court: Counsel, that's not how you refresh recollection. He said it didn't refresh his recollection.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling the police, when they asked you how long it was, you don't know, “We were just laughing the whole time”?
Jason Francia: No, I don't remember that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Do you remember being asked if anything improper happened at the ranch, and you said, “I was around too many people”?
Jason Francia: I'm sorry?
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember police saying to you, “Did anything improper ever happen at the ranch?” And you said, “I was around too many people”?
Jason Francia: I remember hearing that on the tape.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you don't remember saying that?
Jason Francia: I don't remember saying that.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember hearing your voice say that on the tape?
Jason Francia: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And in that 1993 interview, when it came to talking about what happened at the arcade, you didn't know if he'd really touched you improperly, right?
Jason Francia: I knew.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you kept responding, “I don't know”, and then you'd say, “If he really did touch, it was in the arcade”?
Jason Francia: No --
Mr. Mesereau: And you were asked, “Do you think he did it?” And you said, “I don't know”?
Jason Francia: I knew.
Mr. Mesereau: But you told the police you didn't know, correct?
Jason Francia: I don't remember. If you bring that thing to me again, I'm going to -- yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to look at it?
Jason Francia: Yes, bring it over.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Jason Francia: You should just drop one off. Okay.
Mr. Zonen: What page, Counsel?
Mr. Mesereau: That would be 57 and 58.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at those pages?
Jason Francia: I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Does looking at those pages refresh your recollection about what you have told the police --
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: -- in '93?
Jason Francia: I was 13. Eleven years ago.
Mr. Mesereau: You weren't even sure you were tickled at all. Remember that?
Jason Francia: I don't remember that I -- I knew.
Mr. Mesereau: Remember telling the police, “You guys are pushy”?
Jason Francia: Yeah. I remember telling the police that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And after they kept pushing you, you finally said, “You know, I think he did tickle me”, right?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember that? Do you remember at first saying you didn't know, and then after --
Jason Francia: Yeah, I remember saying at first, “I don't know”.
Mr. Mesereau: And after telling the police, “You guys are pushy”, you eventually finally said, “Yes, he tickled me”, right?
Jason Francia: I believe that's how it went.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You kind of went back and forth during the interview, didn't you? One second you'd say, “He tickled me”, and the next second you'd say you're not sure, right?
Jason Francia: I was trying to figure out how to get out of there.
Mr. Mesereau: I understand. And you remember exactly how you felt in 1993 during the interview, right?
Jason Francia: The feeling of, yeah, crying and crappiness.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember the police kept trying to get you to say he's a molester?
Jason Francia: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you what one officer said to you about that?
Jason Francia: Bring it over.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach?
Mr. Zonen: Perhaps the witness could indicate whether it would refresh his recollection.
Jason Francia: It wouldn't.
The Court: When he said “Bring it over”, that sort of means like he'll see if it refreshes his recollection.
Jason Francia: Okay.
The Court: It's a shortcut. Go ahead.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
The Court: We're down to the last seconds here. Run. (Laughter.)
Mr. Zonen: What page, Counsel?
Mr. Mesereau: 60.
Mr. Zonen: What line, please? It's not numbered. Never mind.
Mr. Mesereau: Towards the bottom. Towards the bottom.
Jason Francia: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You're 13 years old. You're sitting there, and one officer said to you --
The Court: Wait a minute now. Are you going to ask him if it refreshes his memory?
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that transcript? Does it refresh your recollection that an officer looked at you said --
The Court: Just a moment, Counsel.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: He said, no, it didn't refresh his recollection. All right. This is the end of the day. (Laughter.) See you tomorrow.
The Court: Go to bed one hour early.
Adjourn Message: The proceedings adjourned at 2:30 p.m.
