Ralph Chacon: Towards the Jacuzzi.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that an area near where you were putting things away?

The Court: Just a moment.
Mr. Sneddon: You have to wait for the Judge to rule, I'm sorry.
Ralph Chacon: I'm sorry.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now you can answer.
The Court: Do you want the question read back?

Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, were you able to observe where they went?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And where did they go?

Mr. Sneddon: And is the rec room near another building or attached to a building on the premises?
Ralph Chacon: Well, it's on its -- the rest room's attached to the rec room. So it sits by itself. It's two stories.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Are there other facilities inside of that building itself?
Ralph Chacon: Just a game room, that's all it was.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know what the game room is called?
Ralph Chacon: Just -- no, I don't.
Mr. Sneddon: Describe the game room, if you would.
Ralph Chacon: They had, like, probably maybe 20 different type of computer games, the first floor, and also with the top, the top floor had different type of games.
Mr. Sneddon: Have you been in that building before?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you know whether or not that building has a cellar?
Ralph Chacon: A what, sir?
Mr. Sneddon: A cellar?
Ralph Chacon: Um, I want to say that had a wine cellar, yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. In any event, you saw Mr. Jackson and the child heading towards the rest room area; is that correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you watch them the entire time?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you see where they went?
Ralph Chacon: They went inside the rest room.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, where were you located when you observed this?
Ralph Chacon: I was in the barbecue area, where I usually normally observe everything.
Mr. Sneddon: That's a security position you're assigned?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at the time that you saw Mr. Jackson and the boy go into the rest room area, did you at some point in time approach the rest room?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall from the time that you saw Mr. Jackson and the child go into the rest room area, how long it was before you approached the area?
Ralph Chacon: Probably a half an hour, maybe 35, 40 minutes.
Mr. Sneddon: And then could you describe to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury where you went?
Ralph Chacon: I went around the rec room that leads right behind the rest rooms. That's where I went.
Mr. Sneddon: And what did you do when you got there? Well, when you got in that area, did you hear or see anything?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And which?
Ralph Chacon: Well, I heard first that Mr. Jackson and the boy were inside a shower, the shower room in there.
Mr. Sneddon: How many showers are there in the rest room?
Ralph Chacon: There was only one shower.
Mr. Sneddon: Let's just stop right there for just a second, before we go any further. Could you explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury the interior of the rest room area?
Ralph Chacon: As you go in from the rec room, the women's rest room is on the left and the men's room is on the right. And as you go in, there's a dressing area, and it's open, and it leads into where the wash basins are at, pretty large area. And then it goes into another smaller room where there's a toilet and the showers.
Mr. Sneddon: And you said “showers”.
Ralph Chacon: Shower. Excuse me, shower.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, you've indicated that you heard some people in the shower. Did you recognize the voices?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Whose voices did you recognize?
Ralph Chacon: Mr. Jackson's and Jordie's.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you look into the shower area?
Ralph Chacon: Not right away. Not the first time that I came around, because I couldn't see anything. But I started to leave the area when I -- I was thinking, I said, “What's going on here?” You know, “There's a grown man in a shower with a boy”.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; move to strike.
The Court: Stricken.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. So you left?
Ralph Chacon: Right.
Mr. Sneddon: How far did you go?
Ralph Chacon: I didn't go too far, probably halfway around the rec room.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And did you decide to go back?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Why did you decide to go back?
Ralph Chacon: I wanted to know what was going on in there.
Mr. Sneddon: Why?
Ralph Chacon: Because it wasn't -- it wasn't right.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Relevance; move to strike.
The Court: I'll strike the question, “Why?” And the answer.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. So you went back. When you went back, where did you go to?
Ralph Chacon: I went back to the same area where the shower was located. There was a window, and I was able to see and they were no longer in the shower.
Mr. Sneddon: So you looked into the window?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And what did you see -- where did you see Mr. Jackson and the child at this point?
Ralph Chacon: I saw them standing in the nude in the middle area, and Jordie was on the right, and he was on the left side. Standing, facing each other.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at the time that you saw that, what were the lighting conditions inside of the rest room?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, it was litted up, just that area there. Not where the shower's at, but that area, it was -- the lights were on.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you have any difficulty seeing in there?
Ralph Chacon: Not at all, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, from the point outside looking down inside, what did you see go on between the defendant, Mr. Jackson, and Jordan Chandler?
Ralph Chacon: I saw that Mr. Jackson was caressing the boy's hair, he was kissing him on his head, and his face, his lips. He started kissing him on the shoulders and started going down to his nipples. Started sucking his nipples. Started going down to his penis and putting it in his mouth. And about that time I just -- I left.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. You say you saw him go down and do what?
Ralph Chacon: He put the little boy's penis in his mouth.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you actually see that?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And then you left?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did you go?
Ralph Chacon: I went back to the barbecue area.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall, after you left that area and observed the things you've just related to the jury, did you see Mr. Jackson with the child again that evening?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: And where were you when you saw them?
Ralph Chacon: I was in the barbecue area.
Mr. Sneddon: And where -- where were they when you saw them again?
Ralph Chacon: They were coming out of the rest room.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, from the time that you had left, when you had made your observations --
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: -- and you left, till the time that they came out of the rest room, how much time had elapsed during that period of time?
Ralph Chacon: Probably 20 minutes or 30 minutes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when they came out of the rest room, could you describe what was going on?
Ralph Chacon: Jordie was mounted on Michael's back, piggybacked, and they were headed for the back of the -- the kitchen door to the main house.
Mr. Sneddon: Did the child, Jordan, have any clothing on?
Ralph Chacon: He had -- I believe it was like -- it was a towel. I believe it was a towel. It's the type -- like it's a rope, but it's a towel.
Mr. Sneddon: So a cloth robe or towel of some kind?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And what was Mr. Jackson wearing, if you recall?
Ralph Chacon: Same.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you see whether or not the child, Jordan, had any other clothing on or not?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir. I didn't observe.
Mr. Sneddon: And where did they go?
Ralph Chacon: They went inside the house, the main house.
Mr. Sneddon: And when they went inside the main house, did you hear or observe anything happen that you felt was unusual?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, Mr. Jackson double-locked the door, the back door, which he normally never did. Security always went inside to secure the house inside and out.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you say -- you described to the jury that Mr. Jackson was kissing the boy --
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: -- that you observed. How would you describe the kissing?
Ralph Chacon: Well, it was very passionate. Very passionately he was kissing him.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you see his hands during the time he was kissing him?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Where were they?
Ralph Chacon: They were all over his body.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I want to show you a couple of photographs, if we might, Mr. Chacon. I've shown these to counsel, Your Honor. The photographs are 790, 791, and 792. All right. Mr. Chacon, let's look at the photographs. First of all, let's start with 790. Do you recognize that?
Ralph Chacon: 790?
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah. I'm sorry, you have to turn it over on the back.
Ralph Chacon: Oh, yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's start with that. Do you recognize what's depicted in the photograph, 790?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And what is that?
Ralph Chacon: That's where the swimming pool's at, and it's -- you're facing at the rec room in front of you, and to the left is the garage area where the carts -- where I was hooking up the carts.
Mr. Sneddon: Does that photograph depict a portion or some of the route that you took where you walked to the area that you observed Mr. Jackson and the child, Jordan?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, what I'd like you to do is to please take that black felt tip pen that I've given you there, and would you please just draw the path that you took that's covered by that photograph, that portion of it. And does that photograph accurately depict the area of what you call the rec room at the time that you made the observations of Mr. Jackson and the child, Jordan?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's turn that one over and go to the next one that has “791” on it, okay? Do you recognize that?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. What is 791?
Ralph Chacon: It's the pool area, and directly in front is the rec room and the rest room. The rest rooms.

Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And does it show the Jacuzzi?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And does it show the approximate area of the -- where you made your observations?
Ralph Chacon: Well, it's behind the -- just the other side of the Jacuzzi, yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. With regard to that particular photograph -- and I'm going to ask you, does it accurately depict the area as you recall it in 1992 or '93 when you made your observations?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I'm going to ask you, please, take that black marker, please, and if you would just circle the area that depicts the entrance into the rest room area? And would you please put an “X” in the approximate area where it was that you made the observations of Mr. Jackson and the child? Now, let's take the last photograph, which is 792 for identification purposes. Do you recognize that photograph?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And can you tell the jury what that is, please?
Ralph Chacon: It's the barbecue area.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, is that the area that you have made reference to in your testimony?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And does that photograph accurately depict that area as it was back when you were working at Neverland Valley Ranch?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I move that 790, 791, and 792 be admitted into evidence.
Mr. Mesereau: No objection.
The Court: They're admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: And, Your Honor, could we have the input for the Elmo, please?
Mr. Sneddon: This is a laser and I'm going to ask you to point to some things.
Ralph Chacon: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. This is the exhibit that's been marked as Exhibit 790 for identification purposes, all right? Do you recognize that, Mr. Chacon?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you show the jury the black line that you placed on this particular exhibit? Okay. It starts at the left-hand side of the photograph; is that correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And moves - go ahead, just trace it - all the way to almost the right-hand side -- or the left-hand side of the building, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, as you walk down past the side of that building that's depicted in the far right-hand side of the photograph, People's 790, what is down there?
Ralph Chacon: There is a tennis court. It's a sunken tennis court.
Mr. Sneddon: And what are the lighting conditions? Is there a path that goes along there?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, there is.
Mr. Sneddon: What are the lighting conditions along that path?
Ralph Chacon: Around the back, there wasn't.
Mr. Sneddon: How about along the path itself?
Ralph Chacon: Towards the -- behind the rest rooms, there was a path where there was just small little lights on the ground.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you have a flashlight with you that night?
Ralph Chacon: Yes sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that part of your standard equipment --
Ralph Chacon: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- that you carry on the graveyard shift?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: The building that's depicted on the far right-hand side of the photograph - yes, sir, the one you're showing the jury there - what is that building there?
Ralph Chacon: That's the rec room.
Mr. Sneddon: And let's go to 791, if we could. All right. Would you show the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, first of all, what you referred to as a Jacuzzi?
Ralph Chacon: Right here.
Mr. Sneddon: So that's in the lower left-hand corner of the exhibit, 791?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, where is the entrance to the rest room?
Ralph Chacon: Right in there.
Mr. Sneddon: And it's hard to see, but you drew a circle around that in black?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir. Right there.
Mr. Sneddon: And now, where -- on this photograph, if you can, can you show the approximate area of where it was that you have made the observations you described to the jury?
Ralph Chacon: Well, this is the rest room in front, and on the side, about right in there. The path is right on the other side on the building there.
Mr. Sneddon: On the back side of the building?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, let's show the next photograph and then I'll come back to this. This is 792 in evidence. Do you recognize that?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And what is that?
Ralph Chacon: That's the barbecue area.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, with regard to this particular photograph, where were you located in your position as a security officer on this evening when you observed the defendant and the child, Jordan, walk into the rest room?
Ralph Chacon: I was about right in that area.
Mr. Sneddon: So you're indicating to the right-hand side of the barbecue area, just to the right of the post?
Ralph Chacon: Right. Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: The post on the -- and were you behind the barbecue itself or on the other side of it?
Ralph Chacon: Well -- well, actually, I was like -- I was moving up and down the side of it, on the other side.
Mr. Sneddon: On the outside of it?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: So not in the interior part, but --
Ralph Chacon: Well, it was in the -- the interior is on the other side also. Because this is in the center.
Mr. Sneddon: Just so we can get it clarified, which side of that were you on?
Ralph Chacon: I was on -- I believe I was on that other side.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, is the area of the -- let's go back to 791 for a second, if we could. You pointed out the Jacuzzi, and obviously there's a swimming pool also there.
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to that area, is that area lit at night?
Ralph Chacon: It is.
Mr. Sneddon: Or was it then? Let's put it that way.
Ralph Chacon: Yeah, just a bit. Because the sidewalks had these lights, these small lights, as you went up through the path. And if I remember correctly, I guess there was some -- some lighting, but not that much. But you could see where you were walking, though.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. All right. You can take that down. I have three more photographs, I've shown them to counsel, that have been marked as 793, 794, and 795 for identification purposes. I'd like to show them to the witness.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: Mr. Chacon, I'm going to show you the photograph marked as 793. You've seen that photograph before?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recognize the person that you believe that that photograph depicts?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Who is that?
Ralph Chacon: Jordie.
Mr. Sneddon: Is that a depiction of the child as you recall him back in those days?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to 794, it has two photographs on it, one at the top and one at the bottom. The one at the top is a singular photograph of an individual, and the one at the bottom has four people in that. Do you recognize the people in that photograph?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And again, who is that?
Ralph Chacon: Jordie.
Mr. Sneddon: And in the photograph at the bottom, there are a number of people depicted. Which of them do you recognize as Jordie?
Ralph Chacon: This one here.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you please take that black pen and just put an arrow towards -- start on the white, down below. Okay. Thank you. And with regard to 795, do you recognize that?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And again, there are a number of people depicted in that photograph, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recognize anybody in that photograph?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: Who would that be?
Ralph Chacon: That's Jordie.
Mr. Sneddon: By “that” you mean who, in terms of -- there's one, two, three, four, five people depicted.
Ralph Chacon: The fifth one.
Mr. Sneddon: All the way over to the left?
Ralph Chacon: All the way over to the left.
Mr. Sneddon: Are these accurate depictions of the child as you recall him back in those days?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Move that they be admitted into evidence, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: No objection.
The Court: Admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, Mr. Chacon, are you familiar with a child by the name -- a young boy by the name of Brett Barnes?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And have you seen Mr. Barnes before?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Have you seen him at the ranch before?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Have you seen him in the company of the defendant before?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: On how many occasions?
Ralph Chacon: Numerous occasions. I couldn't give you a figure.
Mr. Sneddon: When Mr. Barnes was at the ranch, do you recall whether or not his parents were with him?
Ralph Chacon: At times they were; at other times they weren't.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to the child you've described and identified as Jordan Chandler, and the child that you also saw as Brett Barnes, can you tell us what they look like?
Ralph Chacon: Well, to me, I always got them confused, because they looked the same, similar. I know one was a little bit shorter than the other. But, you know, I always got them confused, but they looked -- they looked alike. Maybe one had hair a little bit shorter than the other.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Nonresponsive; narrative.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Sneddon: Go ahead.
Ralph Chacon: But I would get them -- I would -- they just looked the same to me.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. If we could have the Elmo again.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to start backwards at 795. Now, would you use the -- thank you. That's the child you identified by the name of what?
Ralph Chacon: Jordie.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And now 794. Let's do the bottom one for right now. Now, the bottom one, you put an arrow; is that correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Which is the child that you were identifying that you recognize as Jordie. Okay. The one in the middle of the photograph?
Ralph Chacon: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: In the front --
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: -- right? And let's -- let me ask a question about the top photograph. With regard to that photograph, do you recognize that person?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Who's that?
Ralph Chacon: That's Jordie.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And lastly, that's 793 in evidence. And you've identified that individual as also Jordie, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Thank you. We could have the lights again.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the time of your employment at Neverland Valley Ranch -- let me go back a second, okay?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the incidents that you just described to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury here involving Mr. Jackson and the child you've identified as Jordan, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Are those -- is that -- is that what you told the grand jury when you were interviewed back in 1994?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, let's go on for just a moment. Did you see any other incidents involving Mr. Jackson and the child you described as Jordan?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the second -- and let's just call it the second incident. With regard to the second incident, do you recall how much time had elapsed between the two incidents?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Could you give us some idea whether it was weeks, months, or years?
Ralph Chacon: Could have been weeks. Could have been a month. I'm not positive. It's been a while.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And let me go back just for one second before we move on to the second incident. Was there another thing that occurred on the evening of the incident where you saw Mr. Jackson and the child, Jordan, in the rest room together that you had to actually make a report on?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And what was -- what was that?
Ralph Chacon: Well --
Mr. Sneddon: What happened?
Ralph Chacon: Well, Kassim Abdool and myself, we were going around the house, the back side of the house, checking for anything that was open, the normal security checkup that we would do around the house. And we observed that the two French doors in the middle of the house were wide open.
Mr. Sneddon: And so a note was made of that to your supervisor?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Who was your supervisor?
Ralph Chacon: Lieutenant Wade. Kassim Abdool had written a report in regards to the French doors being open and we didn't close them.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; nonresponsive.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Move to strike.
The Court: After “Lieutenant Wade” is stricken.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: So a report was prepared of that?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, the incident about the French doors being open, was that before or after you had observed Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: After.
Mr. Sneddon: It was later that evening?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now we can move on. On the second incident - we're going to call it the second incident just for purposes of - what was it -- were you working graveyard again?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you recall approximately what time of the night it was?
Ralph Chacon: It was in the evening, after ten o'clock when I come on.
Mr. Sneddon: Where were you?
Ralph Chacon: I was in the pool area. Barbecue area, pool area.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you see Mr. Jackson that evening? Let me go back. Did you see Jordan that evening?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: And the child you've identified as Brett, did you see him that evening?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Where were they?
Ralph Chacon: They were in the rec room, playing with the machines.
Mr. Sneddon: Was there any other children in the rec room?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, I noticed a little girl, probably five, six years old. I didn't know who she was, but I'm sure she was probably a sister of one of the boys.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you at some point become aware of the fact -- let me ask you this. Prior -- when the children were in the rec room playing, to your knowledge, was Mr. Jackson on the premises?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you become aware at some point in time that Mr. Jackson was on the premises?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you at some point see Mr. Jackson on the premises?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was Mr. Jackson the first time you saw him?
Ralph Chacon: He was coming out the back of his door -- the back door of his house, the main house.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And describe to the jury what you observed Mr. Jackson to do.
Ralph Chacon: He kind of ran up to the rec room, and he was looking in from the outside, and he spotted Jordie in one of those little -- it's like a car you play, a racing car. And Mr. Jackson went around the area where the rest rooms were at. There's a back door that goes into the rec room, and he located Jordie back there, and he went to where Jordie was at and --
Mr. Sneddon: Let's just stop right there for just a second, okay? You saw him go into the rec room through a back door entrance?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: At the time you saw him go up to Jordan, where were the other children? Could you see?
Ralph Chacon: Yeah, they were upstairs playing games.
Mr. Sneddon: Were the lights on inside of the rec room?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you have any difficulty seeing in the rec room?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, no. No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And where were you located at the time you made these observations?
Ralph Chacon: I was around the pool area, almost right directly in front of the rec room.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at that point in time when you saw Mr. Jackson go actually physically into the rec room, describe to the jury what you saw occur.
Ralph Chacon: Well, I saw him enter through the back door of the rec room, and he went over to Jordie. He bent over and said something to him, and then he kissed him. And then they got out the back door and they ran over to Mr. Jackson's Moon Rover, and -- that was a golf cart that he had specially made for himself, and they took off.
Mr. Sneddon: When you say he kissed him, did you see where he kissed him?
Ralph Chacon: Not exactly, but I know he kissed him.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at some point that evening, did you see Mr. Jackson again?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir. When they came back.
Mr. Sneddon: When they came back. And where were you when they came back?
Ralph Chacon: I was in the barbecue area.
Mr. Sneddon: And when they came back, where did they -- physically, where did you see them when you --
Ralph Chacon: They pulled up to what they called the breezeway, which is between the main office and the main house, the outside office and the main house.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Ralph Chacon: Behind the back.
Mr. Sneddon: And what did -- what -- was anybody else present when they drove up?
Ralph Chacon: Kassim Abdool was coming from the security at that time also.
Mr. Sneddon: So what did you see occur at that point in time?
Ralph Chacon: Well, I saw that Mr. Jackson and Brett -- I mean Jordie got off the cart. And Kassim noticed that they were back, so he just headed back to the security -- security office. And Mr. Jackson and the boy were in front of the -- they call it the Peter Pan display. It's a window where Peter Pan lights up.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you describe that? Where is that located, what building?
Ralph Chacon: Well, it's the -- it's where the office is at, behind the main house. It's connected. There's a breezeway, but it's connected. And there's a display window, or a window where this Peter Pan display is at, where it lights up and you see Tinkerbell flying around the window.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Could you describe to the jury the positions of the child and the defendant, Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: Well, they were looking at the display, the Tinkerbell lighting up. And he was -- Jordie was in front, Mr. Jackson was in back, and he had his hands over like this, and --
Mr. Sneddon: You're indicating over --
Ralph Chacon: Over his back, towards the front.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Ralph Chacon: And then he turned him around, kissed him. It was passionate, but it didn't last that long. And then his hands went down to his private areas. And then they ran inside the house.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. You say he kissed him, and it was not very long but it was passionate. Where did he kiss the child?
Ralph Chacon: In the mouth.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you say “his hands went down”, where did they go -- whose hands went down where?
Ralph Chacon: Mr. Jackson's hands went down to his crotch area, the boy's.
Mr. Sneddon: The boy's?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And what -- how long -- how long do you estimate that this incident took?
Ralph Chacon: It was -- it didn't take very long. Probably 10 seconds, 20 minutes. I'm not sure.
Mr. Sneddon: And then at that point what did you see?
Ralph Chacon: They went -- ran inside the back, the inside of the house.
Mr. Sneddon: Both the child and Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Just a moment, Your Honor. Well, I must have misplaced it. Your Honor, I have one other photograph I'd like to have marked as 796 for identification purposes. And I've shown it to counsel.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the exhibit, 796, do you recognize that?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: What is -- what is that?
Ralph Chacon: This is behind the house. This is behind the house. This is the office. And this is the breezeway.
Mr. Sneddon: So when you talk about a breezeway in your testimony, this photograph depicts that breezeway?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And does it depict the office that you were talking about?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. What I want you to do is, on that photograph, just draw a little arrow and an “O” to the building that you indicated is the office, okay?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And then just put a big “B” in the area that you call the breezeway. All right. Is that photograph an accurate depiction of the area as you recall it back when you observed these incidents?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Move that it be admitted into evidence, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: No objection.
The Court: It's admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: Could we have the lights just briefly, Your Honor?
Mr. Sneddon: All right. This is 796, the photograph we were just talking about, okay?
Ralph Chacon: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you use that little red laser again, and indicate -- there's the “B” that you put, and that is the area that you consider the breezeway?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And you also put an “O” with an arrow. Would you find that for the jury. All right. And that's the area that you described as what?
Ralph Chacon: The outer office where the display is on the window.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. All right. All right. That's good. I just wanted to get those down so everybody can get an idea of what it was like. All right. We can have the lights again. Now, prior to the time -- let me ask you this: With regard to the testimony you've just related to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury here this morning, did you also describe those incidents to the -- when you were asked to make a statement under oath?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: When you were subpoenaed to the grand jury?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, prior to the time that you appeared to give a statement under oath as to the events that you related here this morning, had you ever told anyone about what you saw?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Had you ever mentioned it to anybody?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Why not?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Ralph Chacon: Well, a lot of things went through my mind, but one of the things was who would believe me?
Mr. Sneddon: Why?
Ralph Chacon: Well --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: What else went through your mind?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: Have you ever personally met anybody by the name of Blanca Francia?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Have you ever personally met anyone by the name of Phillipe LeMarque?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Have you met Wade Robson?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And how did you meet Wade Robson?
Ralph Chacon: Just by being on the property and -- and him being on the property.
Mr. Sneddon: How often was he on the property?
Ralph Chacon: Numerous times, but I can't give you a number of how many times.
Mr. Sneddon: Mr. Chacon, when you left the ranch as an employee - okay? --
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Oh, I had another question before we get there. Were you armed?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: At the time that Mr. Jackson -- during the time that you became aware of the fact that Mr. Jackson was under investigation, were there any guards on the ranch property that were armed?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And how many?
Ralph Chacon: There was about four or five of them.
Mr. Sneddon: Were they people who had been employed by the ranch as security officers for -- prior to that time?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you left the ranch, why did you leave?
Ralph Chacon: I was forced to leave --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Ralph Chacon: I was forced to leave because of the OSS, the bodyguards that came on the property that were armed, because we would not comply with whatever they wanted us to do or say, because we didn't -- we didn't -- we went to the grand jury, but they didn't know what we had said so they had put pressure on us to quit.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever tell anybody after you went to the grand jury what you had testified to in front of the grand jury?
Ralph Chacon: After?
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah. Anybody associated with Mr. Jackson.
Ralph Chacon: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Who was that?
Ralph Chacon: Kassim Abdool.
Mr. Sneddon: And that's the person you worked with?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Other than that, anybody else?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you at some point in time file a lawsuit against Mr. Jackson, you and other members of the staff?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, we did.
Mr. Sneddon: And in that particular lawsuit, where was that tried?
Ralph Chacon: Santa Maria, right here, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you lose that lawsuit?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: I have no further questions, Your Honor.
The Court: Cross-examine?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please, Your Honor.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Good morning, Mr. Chacon.
Ralph Chacon: Good morning, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Chacon, my name is Tom Mesereau, and I speak for Mr. Jackson.
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: I'd like to ask you a few questions about that lawsuit you lost. That was the longest civil trial in the history of Santa Maria, right?
Ralph Chacon: I don't know, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: It went about six months, didn't it?
Ralph Chacon: I believe so, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You sued Mr. Jackson and you wanted $16 million, right?
Ralph Chacon: Well, I don't know about the 16 million.
Mr. Mesereau: You wanted millions, true?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Really?
Ralph Chacon: Well, I don't know, sir. Whatever our attorney was -- he's the one who was speaking for us.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. We'll get into that. You sued Mr. Jackson claiming you were wrongfully terminated, right?
Ralph Chacon: That's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: He sued you claiming you had stolen property from him, true?
Ralph Chacon: That's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: The jury found you were not wrongfully terminated by Mr. Jackson, correct?
Ralph Chacon: But we were, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Answer my question, please. Did the Santa Maria jury find you were not wrongfully terminated by Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And they also found you had stolen property from Mr. Jackson, correct?
Ralph Chacon: But I didn't, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did the Santa Maria jury find you had stolen property from Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: A judgment was entered against you, Mr. Chacon, for $25,000, the value of what you had stolen, correct?
Ralph Chacon: For candy bars, sir?
Mr. Mesereau: A judgment was entered against you for $25,000, the value of what the Court found you had stolen, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Well, if a candy bar is worth that much, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: That's not all you owe Mr. Jackson currently, is it?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir. I don't owe him.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, Judge Zel Canter of this court, entered a judgment against you and your co-defendants for $1,473,117.61, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: He ordered you pay all of Mr. Jackson's legal fees and costs, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you ever paid any of that judgment, Mr. Chacon?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir. I filed bankruptcy.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the jury found you not only stole from Mr. Jackson, but you acted maliciously, correct?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did a judge find you had acted with malice?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Is there a judgment against you for acting with fraud against Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: That I know of, no, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to look at the judgment?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: Okay. Oh, it's there, sir. I didn't know. Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that judgment, Mr. Chacon?
Ralph Chacon: Do you mean right now?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: There is not only a judgment against you in favor of Mr. Jackson --
Mr. Sneddon: Wait a minute. I'm going to object. He asked to refresh his recollection. He should ask him if it did.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure.
The Court: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at the judgment against you, Mr. Chacon?
Ralph Chacon: I looked at that, yes, sir. But I don't remember it.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection that there's a judgment against you for fraud and malice --
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: -- in favor of Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You never heard of that before?
Ralph Chacon: Well, probably, but I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: After a six-month trial, you don't remember?
Ralph Chacon: Well, it's been 12 years also, sir, or so.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember stipulating and agreeing that you had personally acted with fraud, oppression and malice against Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: Probably so, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You did that, didn't you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't stipulate that you had acted with fraud, oppression, and malice against Mr. Jackson in that case?
Ralph Chacon: Well, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: After a six-month trial, this is a good way to get even with him, isn't it?
Mr. Sneddon: Argumentative. Object, Your Honor. Move to strike.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you have any motive today, sir, to get even with Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling a therapist you'd rather get a million dollars from Mr. Jackson than work?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember being evaluated by a Ph.D. named Dr. Scott Gorsuch?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall being evaluated by a therapist in that lawsuit?
Ralph Chacon: Probably at one point, but I don't recall it, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Who was your lawyer in that case?
Ralph Chacon: Mr. Ring from Santa Barbara.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember, in response to being called a malinger, you said, “I'd like just a million from Mr. Jackson”?
Ralph Chacon: That's not true, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never happened?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall making statements you didn't want to work again?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. After you left Mr. Jackson, you filed for disability, didn't you?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You weren't disabled, were you?
Ralph Chacon: I think it was just unemployment, wasn't it?
Mr. Mesereau: Did you file for disability, Mr. Chacon, after you left Mr. Jackson's employment?
Ralph Chacon: It was unemployment, I believe it was.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You had a deposition taken in that case under oath, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was not the first time you had ever been deposed, correct?
Ralph Chacon: I don't understand, sir, what you're saying.
Mr. Mesereau: You had had your deposition taken in lawsuits before that one, true?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir. Not that I recall.
Mr. Mesereau: That was the first deposition you'd ever had taken that you recall?
Ralph Chacon: In my life?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember being asked if you were aware that your attorney wanted $16 million for you from Mr. Jackson and you said you understood that?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to show you a page from your deposition?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: Where does it say 16 million? Oh, okay, I see that.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page of your deposition?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Remember you said you were aware that your lawyer had asked for 16 million?
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to ask that counsel be directed to ask whether it refreshes his recollection before he reads.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm sorry. I will withdraw the question.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you looked at that deposition?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You were under oath at the time, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection that you admitted you knew your lawyer had asked for $16 million?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, you said you didn't think 16 million was enough, correct?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you your deposition?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach?
The Court: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: That's on there.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection that you didn't think $16 million was enough to you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't say that?
Ralph Chacon: No, I mean, I don't -- now I see it's written down there, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, how much did you want in the lawsuit, sir?
Mr. Sneddon: Object as argumentative, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: In that lawsuit, you tried to extort Mr. Jackson, didn't you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Object; argumentative, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember being asked at the beginning of your deposition, “Have you ever been deposed before?” And you said, “Yes”?
Ralph Chacon: No, I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Might it refresh your recollection to see that page?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: Okay, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it remind you that you admitted you had been deposed before?
Ralph Chacon: I -- I don't remember. But it's down there, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you'd been in other lawsuits before this, hadn't --
The Court: Counsel, I believe it's time for our break.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Counsel?
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Chacon, you mentioned to the jury someone named Kassim Abdool, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And was Kassim Abdool someone you worked with at Neverland?
Ralph Chacon: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And I believe you told the jury that he was the first person you talked to about your claim that Mr. Jackson was molesting young men, correct?
Ralph Chacon: I believe so, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Kassim Abdool joined you in that lawsuit against Mr. Jackson, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Kassim Abdool also had a judgment against him in favor of Mr. Jackson for $1,473,117.61, correct?
Ralph Chacon: I believe so, sir, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Kassim Abdool joined you in trying to get millions from Mr. Jackson, right?
Mr. Sneddon: Object as argumentative, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that correct?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir. No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, he didn't?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: He wasn't a plaintiff with you in that case?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, he was, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You're saying that Mr. Abdool was not looking for millions like you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: How much did he want, Mr. Chacon?
Ralph Chacon: There wasn't an amount, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: After a six-month trial, your lawyer didn't ask the jury to award an amount for you, sir?
Ralph Chacon: You'll have to ask Mr. Ring.
Mr. Mesereau: You were sitting there, weren't you?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you hear him give a closing argument to the jury?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object; argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you telling this jury today, under oath, you don't know how much your lawyer asked for in that six-month trial?
Ralph Chacon: I saw it earlier when you showed --
Mr. Sneddon: Excuse me. I'm going to object as argumentative and immaterial.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: There was also someone named Adrian McManus who joined you in suing Mr. Jackson, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And Adrian McManus had worked at Neverland, right?
Ralph Chacon: That's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And like you and Mr. Abdool, she lost the case, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: A Santa Maria jury ruled against her as well, right?
Ralph Chacon: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, Adrian McManus was also found to have stolen property from Mr. Jackson, true?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you the judgment?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object as immaterial with regard to this witness's testimony; beyond his knowledge; no foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you last talk to Adrian McManus?
Ralph Chacon: Probably months; months ago.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you talk about this case at all?
Ralph Chacon: Only if I knew when I was coming down, and how she was doing.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that all you discussed about this case?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: How long was the conversation?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, couldn't have lasted more than five minutes, because she was at work.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you last talk to Kassim Abdool?
Ralph Chacon: I have not, sir, at all.
Mr. Mesereau: Not at all?
Ralph Chacon: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When's the last time you talked to him?
Ralph Chacon: Probably the time when we left court here. Back then.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. Now, when you sued Mr. Jackson, you had judgments against you in other cases, true?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object as immaterial.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: When you sued Mr. Jackson, the wages you were getting from Mr. Jackson were being partially garnished, correct?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. Same objection.
Mr. Mesereau: Financial motive, Your Honor.
The Court: The objection is overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Mesereau: Correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: They were being garnished because you wouldn't pay child support, true?
Ralph Chacon: I was paying child support, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Then why were they garnished?
Ralph Chacon: I assume that's the procedure they do when they want child support from you.
Mr. Mesereau: You couldn't just send a check yourself?
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object to that --
The Court: Sustained; calls for a legal conclusion.
Mr. Mesereau: At one point, you asked a Santa Barbara sheriff for money, true?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall ever asking Mr. Birchim for some money?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you saying it never happened?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When did you last talk to Russ Birchim?
Ralph Chacon: This morning.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did you talk to him?
Ralph Chacon: Here at the courthouse.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you talk about your testimony?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you're not denying that you asked him for money and you're not denying he gave it to you; you just don't remember, right?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you first meet Russ Birchim?
Ralph Chacon: I believe it was back in '93, I believe. I'm not sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever hear of a company called Commercial Trade?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't have a lawsuit with Commercial Trade in 1989?
Mr. Sneddon: Object as immaterial.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know someone named Judge Byrd?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Judge Byrd had a judgment against you for a couple thousand dollars, didn't she?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object to this and ask the Court to admonish counsel.
The Court: The --
Mr. Mesereau: It's all part of the financial motive, Your Honor.
The Court: There's no time frame. The problem you're asking about is when. I don't know that. So I'll sustain the objection on vagueness.
Mr. Mesereau: At the time you sued Mr. Jackson for an amount you don't remember, isn't it true you had a judgment against you for $2600 by a Ms. Judge Byrd?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you your deposition where you talked about it?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: Oh, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that deposition page?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did it refresh your recollection?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know who Judge Byrd is?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know anything about a judgment she ever had against you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, when did you first tell Kassim Abdool, your co-plaintiff against Mr. Jackson, about this alleged molestation you witnessed?
Ralph Chacon: Probably when -- when we -- when we knew that we were going to be subpoenaed to the grand jury.
Mr. Mesereau: And approximately when was that?
Ralph Chacon: I believe it was in '94 sometime.
Mr. Mesereau: By the way, do you remember testifying that Sheriff Russ Birchim delivered money to you?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you your deposition?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: It's down there, but I don't recall that, sir, at all.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall saying it?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Don't recall anything about it?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. It just is down there, right?
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object to the comment as argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember testifying under oath you asked Mr. Birchim for money?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: That's been asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember asking for money so your wife could relocate?
Ralph Chacon: Probably -- probably so, sir. Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember wanting other bills paid?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How long after you told Kassim Abdool, your co-plaintiff, about these alleged acts of molestation did you speak to anyone from law enforcement?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it years?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, no. No, not years.
Mr. Mesereau: How long was it?
Ralph Chacon: Could have been weeks, days. I'm not certain, sir. It's been a while.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you review any documents to get ready to testify today?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Anyone send you any documents to look at --
Ralph Chacon: No.
Mr. Mesereau: -- before you testified today?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you last talk to Mr. Ring about your suit against Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: I haven't talked to Mr. Ring in years, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. Now, at the time you filed your lawsuit against Mr. Jackson, you knew that other former employees at Neverland had sold stories to tabloids about Mr. Jackson, didn't you?
Ralph Chacon: Could you rephrase that, sir?
Mr. Mesereau: Sure. At the time you filed your lawsuit against Mr. Jackson, you were aware that other former employees at Neverland had sold stories to tabloids, correct?
Ralph Chacon: I don't understand the “others”, sir. Which others?
Mr. Mesereau: Blanca Francia?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never heard of it?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, yes, I heard of it. But I didn't -- I wasn't aware of that.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you aware of anyone else at Neverland who was employed at one point trying to go to a tabloid to sell a story?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never heard anything about it?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever hear anything about Adrian McManus doing that?
Ralph Chacon: Well, we went to a tabloid.
Mr. Mesereau: Which one?
Ralph Chacon: It was The Star.
Mr. Mesereau: And who was “we”?
Ralph Chacon: It was myself, Adrian McManus, Kassim Abdool, and I guess that was it.
Mr. Mesereau: And approximately when did you go to this tabloid?
Ralph Chacon: We had met at Mr. Ring's office in Santa Barbara.
Mr. Mesereau: And after you met with your attorney, who represented you in the lawsuit, you went to a tabloid, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Right. Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you wanted money for a story, true?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Who did you meet with at the tabloid when you requested money?
Ralph Chacon: Can you rephrase that, sir?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, sir. Who did you meet with when you went to a tabloid to request money?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, there was myself, Kassim, Adrian, and whoever the reporter was, and Mr. Ring.
Mr. Mesereau: Your lawyer was there with you, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You did it with your lawyer because you thought that negative publicity would pressure Mr. Jackson into paying all of you money, right?
Ralph Chacon: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Object as argumentative, Your Honor.
The Court: Overruled. The answer was, “No”. Next question.
Mr. Mesereau: You went to the tabloid before the case was tried to a jury, right?
Ralph Chacon: I believe so, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you filed a case before you went to the tabloid?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, but I believe so, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you sell a story to the tabloid?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever hire a broker to help you sell other stories to other tabloids?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever hear anything about McManus doing that?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. What other tabloids did you speak to?
Ralph Chacon: None, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Just one?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Just Star?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: But you were aware that McManus went to other tabloids, true?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Just Star?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever speak to anyone at Inside Edition?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How about any other newspaper?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you wanted to sell information about Mr. Jackson allegedly acting wrongfully with young men, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir. To The Star.
Mr. Mesereau: And you also wanted to sell information about his relationship with Lisa Marie Presley, correct?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never did that?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever hear of any of your co-plaintiffs doing that?
Ralph Chacon: That I recall, I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Don't recall it at all?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was your story printed, to your knowledge?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Approximately when did that happen?
Ralph Chacon: I don't know the date, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Any idea at all?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Can't even estimate, right?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. How long after you told your co-plaintiff against Mr. Jackson, Mr. Kassim Abdool, about these alleged acts of molestation did you both go to a tabloid?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, I -- it wasn't -- it wasn't right away. But I don't recall when it was.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. It was before you went to law enforcement, wasn't it?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it after it?
Ralph Chacon: I believe so, sir. I don't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Mr. Chacon, in late '93 and early '94, you told other people that Michael Jackson was innocent of molestation accusations, didn't you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never told that to anyone at the ranch?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Are you familiar with a tabloid called Splash?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: What is Splash?
Ralph Chacon: I believe it's a tabloid.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever met with someone named Peter Burt from Splash?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you saying you don't recall, or you don't -- you didn't?
Ralph Chacon: I don't remember, sir, if I did or not.
Mr. Mesereau: So you could have, but you don't remember?
Ralph Chacon: Could have, but I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know somebody named Sandy Domz?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Who was Sandy Domz?
Ralph Chacon: She was one of the secretaries at Neverland Ranch.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall Sandy Domz ever approaching a tabloid?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Don't know anything about it?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Do you recall speaking to a book author named Gutierrez?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And approximately when did you speak to a book author named Gutierrez?
Ralph Chacon: I believe that was before we went to Star, and -- but I don't remember the -- I don't remember the date or the time.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember splitting money from any tabloids with any other employees or former employees of Neverland?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You never split money for giving information to a T.V. show called Inside Edition?
Ralph Chacon: That I recall, no, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: So you're not telling the jury you didn't do it, you're just saying, “I don't recall”?
Ralph Chacon: Well, I don't -- I don't think I did it or we did it, no, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know for sure?
Ralph Chacon: I just don't recall if we did or not, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You might have, but you don't remember, right?
Ralph Chacon: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever complain at Neverland that you should be paid more money than you were getting?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember filing a claim for disability with EDD after you left Neverland?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Are you saying that didn't happen?
Ralph Chacon: Well, I filed for unemployment.
Mr. Mesereau: Not disability?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. When is the last time you worked at Neverland; do you know?
Ralph Chacon: It's probably mid '94, I believe, or around there.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, when you sued Mr. Jackson in Santa Maria, you also sued other people at Neverland, right?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You sued James Van Norman, didn't you?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You sued Tony Coleman?
Ralph Chacon: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You sued Marcus Johnson, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you sued Bill Bray, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And Betty Bailey, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And Andrew Merritt, right?
Ralph Chacon: I believe so, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were claiming that they had wrongfully interfered with your employment, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, they did.
Mr. Mesereau: And are these some of the people that you described as being bodyguards for Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, the OSS.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't like the OSS being at Neverland, did you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You wanted to handle all of the security yourself, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Well, there was a time that I was in charge, and I knew what I was doing, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you felt they didn't, right?
Ralph Chacon: Well, they shouldn't have interfered with my job.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And obviously you lost that claim in front of a Santa Maria jury, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Object as argumentative, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: The claims against the people in addition to Mr. Jackson who had worked at Neverland, you lost those claims, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, at the time you sued Mr. Jackson, you had complained that you couldn't pay your rent, right?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever complain to anyone you couldn't pay your rent?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never complained to any sheriff, right?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall. I don't think so, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you don't know for sure?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. All right. Now, when Mr. Jackson sued you for stealing his property, do you recall what property he was accusing you of stealing from him?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: What was the property?
Ralph Chacon: It was candy bars from the theater. And the other stuff I'm not sure of, but I believe they were referring to my briefcase that had memos, my personal memos from my box at the security office.
Mr. Mesereau: Anything else?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the jury found that the material you stole was worth $25,000, correct?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, they entered a judgment against you for $25,000 for maliciously converting Mr. Jackson's property, true?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object to this.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know what the amount was, Mr. Chacon?
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object. It's the same question, just asked a different way.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You were found to have stolen documents from Mr. Jackson, true?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object; asked and answered.
Mr. Mesereau: I don't think it is.
The Court: That question hasn't been asked, but the ruling that I made is that the issues that you can go into are not the issues of the lawsuit. It's the same as the J.C. Penney case. You can go into what he said, what he hasn't said, the same exact ruling, and you're --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: The area you're in now has to do with the issues in the lawsuit. So I want you -- that's the line we're trying to walk here.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I'll move on, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know someone named Linda Allen, Mr. Chacon?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Who is Linda Allen?
Ralph Chacon: She was my landlady in Lompoc.
Mr. Mesereau: For how long?
Ralph Chacon: Probably about a year. I'm not for certain of the length of time.
Mr. Mesereau: When you were suing Mr. Jackson, you told Linda Allen you would soon be able to pay her the back rent you owed, right?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object to that question. The same 403 ruling.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you do that, Mr. Chacon?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever tell Linda Allen, “I'm going to be a star witness against Michael Jackson”?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Ever tell Linda Allen you were going to be on the T.V. show Hard Copy to talk about Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever tell Linda Allen you had a gun permit because you were a star witness against Michael Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever tell Ms. Allen you were going to make two or three million dollars with your suit against Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever will tell Linda Allen you were going to be driving a 450 Mercedes after you won your suit against Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. None of that rings a bell, right?
Ralph Chacon: No. No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, in your meeting with the first tabloid that you talked to, okay, where Abdool was present, who else was there?
Ralph Chacon: I believe Adrian McManus, Abdool, myself, Mr. Ring, and whoever represented that tabloid. I don't know, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Who arranged the meeting?
Ralph Chacon: Mr. Ring.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know someone named Gary Morgan?
Ralph Chacon: I've heard the name before, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Where have you heard the name?
Ralph Chacon: Probably -- maybe he's the one that represented the tabloid. I'm not sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever talk to Gary Morgan?
Ralph Chacon: I probably did, but I don't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall ever being interviewed by someone who claimed to be a media broker, meaning they could actually get you to various tabloids on T.V. or in print?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never heard of anything about that, right?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you draft a story for the tabloids at Mr. Ring's office?
Ralph Chacon: Probably, yes, sir. Probably did. I don't -- I don't recall, but I probably did.
Mr. Mesereau: Why do you say you probably did?
Ralph Chacon: Because it's kind of vague. It's been a long time, and I guess I did. I'm -- I would say I did, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, it hasn't been much longer than the period of time you claim you remember these events about Mr. Jackson, true?
Ralph Chacon: Well, I probably did, sir, draft that --
Mr. Mesereau: Probably did, or you did?
Ralph Chacon: I did.
Mr. Sneddon: It's argumentative.
The Court: Overruled. The answer was he did. Next question.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did you draft a story for Splash?
Ralph Chacon: I believe that was the tabloid, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And after you drafted it, did you meet with somebody from Splash?
Ralph Chacon: Whoever it was. I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you personally interviewed by somebody from Splash?
Ralph Chacon: We all were, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Jointly or individually?
Ralph Chacon: Jointly.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How long was the interview with Splash?
Ralph Chacon: Could have been an hour or so. I'm not for certain how long.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall telling anyone that you were using the money from Splash to help fund your lawsuit against Michael Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, the money went directly to Mr. Ring.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was approximately $17,000, wasn't it?
Ralph Chacon: I don't know, sir. But whatever it was, he did get it.
Mr. Mesereau: So can you estimate what it was?
Ralph Chacon: I can't, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you get any money yourself as --
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling people you gave most of it to Mr. Ring, but you took about 500 bucks yourself?
Ralph Chacon: Well, we had taken 500 bucks, but we gave it back to Mr. Ring, because he was our lawyer and he needed money.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. That was to fund the lawsuit where you sought millions from Michael Jackson, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Well, that was the lawsuit, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: That was the lawsuit you were trying to fund by selling stories to tabloids, true?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: No?
Ralph Chacon: I really don't understand your question.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure, I'll rephrase. You were taking money from tabloids and using it to fund costs of your lawsuit against Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: Oh. Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: And before you went to Mr. Ring, you had told various people that you never saw anything inappropriate at Neverland, true?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You told various people you'd never seen Michael Jackson molest anybody, true?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: So if anybody comes into court and says that, they're just not telling the truth, right?
Ralph Chacon: That's correct, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When you first met with representatives of the sheriff's department, did you tell them everything that you have said today about Mr. Jackson allegedly molesting young men?
Ralph Chacon: Um, when you mean a sheriff, a certain sheriff, or at the sheriff's department, or -- I don't understand.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase. When you first spoke to a sheriff from Santa Barbara, did you tell that sheriff everything you've said today in court?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: The story has changed considerably since your first meeting with a sheriff, true?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object to the use of the word “considerably” as argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Would you agree that with each interview you do, you add more lurid facts about Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You would agree your story about what you claim he did has changed through the years, has it not?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you just meet with Mr. Sneddon the other day?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you tell Mr. Sneddon you had new facts that you forgot in 1993?
Mr. Sneddon: Well, wait a minute. I'm going to object to that question. Your Honor, that's not asked in good faith with regard to the -- I can't do it without a speaking objection, but if we could approach the bench, because this is not right.
The Court: Overruled. The question was, “Did you tell Mr. Sneddon you had new facts that you had forgot in 1993?”
Ralph Chacon: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Mr. Sneddon that you forgot to say certain things in 1993 about Mr. Jackson allegedly molesting young men, true?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: But now you remembered them in 2005, right?
Ralph Chacon: Vaguely, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said the person that remembered them with you is Kassim Abdool, true?
Ralph Chacon: I haven't talked to Kassim in years.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When did you first start work at Neverland, Mr. Chacon?
Ralph Chacon: I believe it was in '91, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You knew that in late '93 and early '94, the media was devoting a lot of attention to stories about Mr. Jackson at Neverland, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Well, the media was always at Neverland at some time or other, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Before you chose to go to a tabloid, you knew that others were going to tabloids to try and tell stories about Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You were the first, right?
Ralph Chacon: That went to the media, to the tabloids?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did you go?
Ralph Chacon: It was probably '94 sometime.
Mr. Mesereau: But you knew there was a lot of media attention before that, correct?
Ralph Chacon: There always has been, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you knew people were making money doing that, right?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Weren't aware of that?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Thought they were doing it all for free, right, Mr. Chacon?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Object as argumentative, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you think Mr. Jackson is an intimidating-looking individual?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember in your deposition you said you were entitled to damages because Mr. Jackson stared at you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Remember you said Mr. Jackson stared, and you didn't know how to take it?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you your deposition?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: Okay. Okay. I remember.
Mr. Mesereau: As part of your damage claim, do you remember saying that Mr. Jackson stared at you continuously?
Ralph Chacon: Not continuously, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you said “all the time”, right?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You said no one else saw him staring at you, right?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: But it bothered you, right?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Why did you say it?
Ralph Chacon: I guess just to say it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. As part of your damage claim, you claimed that employees were threatening you at Neverland, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, they were, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And the jury didn't believe that, did they?
Mr. Sneddon: I'll object as argumentative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you start working the graveyard shift at Neverland?
Ralph Chacon: Immediately, sir, when I got hired on.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you gradually work your way into that?
Ralph Chacon: Immediately I went to the graveyard. Then they shifted me to swings for a while, probably a month or so, and then I ended back on graveyard. As a matter of fact, I preferred to work graveyard, sir, because I had a second job.
Mr. Mesereau: Where was the second job?
Ralph Chacon: In Lompoc.
Mr. Mesereau: What was that?
Ralph Chacon: I worked for Wayne's Tires.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember problems with intruders while you worked at Neverland?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And what problems with intruders do you remember?
Ralph Chacon: Them coming on property and -- and we turned them over to the sheriff's department.
Mr. Mesereau: And how often do you remember that happening?
Ralph Chacon: Probably several times, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall Mr. Jackson getting nervous about that?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he seem to care about it, to you?
Ralph Chacon: He wasn't even there when we apprehended the people.
Mr. Mesereau: He certainly learned about it, to your knowledge, correct?
Ralph Chacon: I don't know, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You never talked to him about it?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were not aware of anyone else telling Mr. Jackson about these problems with intruders?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Sir, Mr. Jackson had some personal security guards because he was worried about these intruders being caught on the property, right?
Ralph Chacon: I don't believe so, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You and the other security people didn't carry any weapons, right?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir, we didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: And at times, that was a concern of Mr. Jackson's, wasn't it, that his security personnel there didn't have any weapon to protect him?
Ralph Chacon: I don't know, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: He had a general policy of not wanting people to carry weapons, true?
Ralph Chacon: I don't know, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know at all?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see any of your security team carrying a weapon?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know why?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Had no idea at all?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never inquired?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: When you first joined up, did you ask anybody, “Do security people carry weapons at Neverland?”
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you given any manual to refer to when you worked at Neverland?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And what do you know about that manual?
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object; vague.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: It's vague, I'll rephrase.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you telling the jury that when you started working security at Neverland, nobody told you, “We have a general policy of having security people not carry arms”?
Ralph Chacon: Well, probably so, because nobody was carrying arms.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have a gun permit at the time?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: How many meetings did you have with representatives of the sheriff's department before you think you told all the facts about what you say Mr. Jackson did with young men?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object as argumentative; assumes facts.
The Court: Calls for a narrative. You can break that question down.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: When was your first meeting with any representative of the sheriff's department regarding what you claim you saw at Neverland?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately when it was?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir, I don't.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it after you saw the events you described today?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you've given the jury a detailed description of the events you claim you saw at Neverland, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: But you've forgotten when you talked to the sheriffs, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Well, I know I talked to them, but I just don't recall exactly when it was at, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately when it was at?
Ralph Chacon: It was in '94, I believe, sometime.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know how many meetings you've had with the sheriffs to date where you have talked about Mr. Jackson's inappropriate behavior?
Ralph Chacon: Well, with the sheriffs, I didn't talk about this, the allegations. But with the grand jury, which I went to testify, that was the first time, and there was sheriffs present there.
Mr. Mesereau: You testified before a Santa Barbara Grand Jury, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And after you testified, no criminal charges were brought, right?
Ralph Chacon: Right, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You went to Los Angeles and talked to prosecutors --
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: -- about what you claim -- you never did that?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't you tell Mr. Sneddon on direct examination that you were subpoenaed to a grand jury in Los Angeles?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, yes, sir. But I didn't go.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't go. But you went down to be interviewed under oath instead of going, true?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And as a result of your interview under oath, no charges were ever brought in Los Angeles, right?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember testifying how upset you were at Neverland when you learned that other employees got raises and you didn't?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, I believe there was one time.
Mr. Mesereau: And tell the jury what that was all about.
Ralph Chacon: Probably they had hired two or three security, and they -- I believe they paid them $12 an hour, and we were only getting $9 an hour.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you complain about it to somebody?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Who?
Ralph Chacon: Probably the lieutenant.
Mr. Mesereau: And what happened?
Ralph Chacon: Nothing ever happened.
Mr. Mesereau: Was Mr. Abdool upset about that also, to your knowledge?
Ralph Chacon: I believe so, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you and he met and talked about it, right?
Ralph Chacon: Pardon me?
Mr. Mesereau: You and he met and talked about it, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Well, we all talked about that in security.
Mr. Mesereau: You lodged a complaint, didn't you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you think Mr. Jackson's security guards were being paid more than you?
Ralph Chacon: The new ones, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you know what they were getting paid?
Ralph Chacon: I don't remember. I don't recall, sir, how we found out.
Mr. Mesereau: When you told the jury you saw a young boy on Mr. Jackson's back, was that in the shower?
Ralph Chacon: No, it was coming out, going towards his house.
Mr. Mesereau: Was he on his shoulders?
Ralph Chacon: You know, I don't recall if he was on his shoulders or on his back, like piggybacked, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: When you went to work at Neverland, you were asked to sign a confidentiality agreement, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And everybody who works at Neverland is asked to sign one, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And the purpose, as explained to you, was that Mr. Jackson doesn't want employees just running to tabloids and telling stories, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: When you went to a tabloid, you violated the agreement, correct?
Mr. Sneddon: Object, Your Honor, calls for a legal conclusion.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't violate it all?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: So you thought going to a tabloid after you left your employment at Neverland was perfectly consistent with your confidentiality obligations to Mr. Jackson, right?
Ralph Chacon: I don't think I ever signed a confidentiality, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure about that?
Ralph Chacon: I'm not for certain, but I don't recall that I ever did.
Mr. Mesereau: Weren't you asked to?
Ralph Chacon: I probably was. But at that time they didn't have one for me.
Mr. Mesereau: At the time you and Mr. Abdool and Ms. McManus and your lawyer went to the tabloid, your lawyer was trying to negotiate to get money from Mr. Jackson, wasn't he?
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object. Lack of foundation and it assumes --
The Court: Foundation; sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: At the time you and Mr. Abdool and Ms. McManus and your lawyer went to a tabloid to give a story about Mr. Jackson, do you know whether or not your lawyer was trying to negotiate money from Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know whether or not your lawyer was trying to pressure Mr. Jackson by threatening bad publicity?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever hear of anything like that going on?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So if that went on, you'd be shocked, true?
Ralph Chacon: Probably not, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Probably not?
Ralph Chacon: I guess not, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever explain to Mr. Jackson yourself that you were having trouble making ends meet financially?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you explain to anyone at Neverland about that before you left?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Without getting into any of your discussions with your lawyer, who of your group first went to that attorney?
Ralph Chacon: Which attorney, sir?
Mr. Mesereau: Ring. Mr. Ring.
Ralph Chacon: Who first went to Mr. Ring?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: Of us?
Mr. Mesereau: Of you. Excuse me, let me rephrase the question. Make it clearer. You, Mr. Abdool, Ms. McManus sued Mr. Jackson, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You were represented by a lawyer in Santa Barbara named Mr. Ring, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And he represented you throughout that six-month trial that you lost, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Who first approached Mr. Ring about trying to get money from Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: We all did, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Together?
Ralph Chacon: We hired him, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know how you found out about him?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Was he the only lawyer you talked to, or did you talk to some others?
Ralph Chacon: I believe he was the only one we talked to, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall whether you ever told anyone, “Mr. Jackson promised me if I did a good job, I would have a job at Neverland forever”?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he ever say anything like that to you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did anyone who hired you at Neverland?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You met with Prosecutor Sneddon on April 6th, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Was anyone else at the meeting?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Who?
Ralph Chacon: Russ Birchim.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did the meeting take place?
Ralph Chacon: Here in Santa Maria.
Mr. Mesereau: And who arranged the meeting?
Ralph Chacon: I believe it was Mr. Sneddon.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he call you on the phone?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he tell you where to meet?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: How long was the meeting?
Ralph Chacon: Probably less than an hour.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you discuss anything you were going to say today?
Ralph Chacon: I believe so, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Mr. Sneddon tell you what questions he was going to ask you today?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell him what answers you were going to give to those questions?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell him anything about how you were going to respond?
Ralph Chacon: I just told him that I would speak the truth.
Mr. Mesereau: That's it?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: How long was the meeting?
Ralph Chacon: Probably about -- less than an hour.
Mr. Mesereau: So during the portion of that hour that you spoke, all you ever said was, “I'll tell the truth, I'll tell the truth, I'll tell the truth”, or words to that effect?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir. No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. He told you what questions he was going to ask you, correct?
Ralph Chacon: I believe so, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You told him what your responses were going to be, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: When was the -- excuse me. Before that meeting, when was the last time you had met with anyone from the prosecuting office here?
Ralph Chacon: I didn't meet with anybody.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you talk with anyone on the phone?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir. I was --
Mr. Mesereau: Who was that?
Ralph Chacon: I believe it was a secretary from Mr. Sneddon's office.
Mr. Mesereau: And what was that discussion about?
Ralph Chacon: When I was supposed to be down here and how to get -- how to get to Santa Maria.
Mr. Mesereau: How many meetings have you had with any representative of the sheriff's department in total to talk about your testimony?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object as vague as to time, a time period.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll rephrase it.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Mesereau: In the last year, how many meetings have you had with anyone representing the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department to talk about this case?
Ralph Chacon: I haven't, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: How about phone calls?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. You're aware of Mr. Jackson going on tour -- excuse me. Let me rephrase it. You're aware that Mr. Jackson periodically went on tour while you worked at Neverland, true?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And it was your understanding he always had bodyguards with him, correct, on tour?
Ralph Chacon: I understood that, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You knew he was extremely concerned about his security, right?
Ralph Chacon: His bodyguard security or security on the ranch?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, Mr. Jackson was extremely concerned about security on the ranch, wasn't he?
Ralph Chacon: I don't know, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Even with these intruders, you're not sure if he was concerned?
Ralph Chacon: Well, I'm sure he was concerned, but he was never there when we did apprehend them.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You knew he had concerns about his personal security when he went on tour, right?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And at all times that you worked on the ranch, you knew he had personal bodyguards when he went on tour, right?
Ralph Chacon: When he went on tour, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew he had personal protection when he went other places for other reasons, true?
Ralph Chacon: I assume so, sir. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember complaining that Mr. Abdool got a raise when you didn't?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never happened?
Ralph Chacon: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When you left Neverland, you just stopped showing up for work, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You stopped showing up for work after you met with Attorney Ring, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Probably so, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You were disappointed that you weren't getting more money from tabloids, weren't you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never complained to anybody about that?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: The first incident you claim you saw Mr. Jackson improperly touch a young man was when?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall. Between '92 and '93, I believe. I'm not for certain.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall ever telling any representative of law enforcement the month or the year?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir. I don't -- no.
Mr. Mesereau: And what shower are you claiming Mr. Jackson used when you say you looked in a shower and saw him acting inappropriately?
Ralph Chacon: It was the outside rest rooms by the rec room.
Mr. Mesereau: There were two of them, right?
Ralph Chacon: Two rest rooms?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: There was a women's and a men's room, I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: And which one do you claim you saw Mr. Jackson in?
Ralph Chacon: In the men's room, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you seen him in that men's room before?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. By the way, when you went to the Santa Barbara Grand Jury, you didn't tell them everything you said today, did you?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Everything?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell them everything you've told Mr. Sneddon?
Ralph Chacon: Well, that one incident that I recalled I didn't. I didn't bring that up, no, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: How long were you in front of a Santa Barbara Grand Jury?
Ralph Chacon: Could have been a couple hours.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point, you called to see if anybody had charged Mr. Jackson with anything, didn't you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never asked anyone?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never asked anyone in the sheriff's department?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Never asked Mr. Sneddon?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: To this day you've never asked that question, right?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. When did you first learn Blanca Francia had sold a story to Hard Copy?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. That question has been asked and answered and that assumes facts not in evidence.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll rephrase it.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn that Blanca Francia had told a story for $20,000 to the T.V. show Hard Copy?
Ralph Chacon: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Object. Asked and answered.
The Court: All right. He answered it. It's “No”. Next question.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn she had sold a story to Hard Copy, without knowing the amount she got?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you learn that?
Ralph Chacon: Probably on the news.
Mr. Mesereau: On the news when?
Ralph Chacon: I don't recall, sir. It was -- it was public knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see the show?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you hear about it right after it appeared on television?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you employed when that was on television?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Where were you working at that point?
Ralph Chacon: Where was I working? That's a good question. I believe I was already in Nevada by that time.
Mr. Mesereau: And what were you doing there?
Ralph Chacon: I was a substitute teacher at a high school and junior high.
Mr. Mesereau: What year was this?
Ralph Chacon: '96, '7, '8.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember learning that security guards at the Jackson home in Encino had sold stories for $100,000?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir, I didn't know anything about that place.
Mr. Mesereau: Never heard anything about that?
Ralph Chacon: Well, I know they had security guards, but I never heard anything.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you hear anything about security guards at the Encino home selling a story for $100,000?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Ever know someone named Quindoy?
Ralph Chacon: I want to say that the Quindoys -- I believe they were chefs, I believe, but I'm not positive.
Mr. Mesereau: They were what?
Ralph Chacon: I believe they were cooks or chefs there at some property.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know them?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever talk to them?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know they had tried to sell stories to tabloids about Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you ever heard anything about that as you sit here today?
Ralph Chacon: Probably have, but I don't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, at some point you claimed you were improperly subjected to electronic surveillance at Neverland, right?
Ralph Chacon: Could you be a little bit more specific, sir?
Mr. Mesereau: Sure.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. I'm going to object because of the 403 ruling, but more specifically because there are multiple defendants in the causes of action. It may be different as to different individuals.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm only talking about him, Your Honor. His claims against Mr. Jackson.
The Court: I'm going to allow the question, but I'm going to do so assuming it's not related to specific allegations in the Complaint, which I already said you can't directly go into.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, there were such -- there were such claims, Your Honor.
The Court: I know, but we're not relitigating that issue. But he could have made a claim or his attorney could have made a claim. You're asking him not about claims his attorney made, but claims that he made.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, I am.
The Court: I'm going to allow the question with that understanding.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
The Court: But you probably have to read it back to him. Do you remember the question?
Mr. Mesereau: I can rephrase it.
Ralph Chacon: No.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll withdraw it.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember claiming that you were emotionally distressed because you thought your telephone conversations were listened in to at Neverland?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you never knew whether or not there was a tap on any phone, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, I did, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you saying you did know there was a tap?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, I knew that they had equipment where they were listening in.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember testifying under oath you didn't know if your phone was tapped?
Ralph Chacon: At home or at the ranch, sir?
Mr. Mesereau: Either place.
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever state under oath you didn't know whether your phone was tapped?
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I object to the question as vague as to place.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You claim you had been emotionally damaged because someone listened in to your calls at Neverland, right?
Ralph Chacon: Emotionally damaged. Well, I probably -- probably didn't say that, but I was upset because they were listening to my personal phone calls, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And your basis for saying that was that somebody had told you that was going on, right?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir, I knew it was going on.
Mr. Mesereau: You had no knowledge of electronic surveillance at the time, did you?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have a check done on the phones?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: When is the last time you talked to any tabloid about this case?
Ralph Chacon: I have not, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You haven't?
Ralph Chacon: I haven't talked to anyone.
Mr. Mesereau: Are you planning to go to a tabloid after you testify?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir. I just want to go home.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you make a complaint that your employee file was unfairly looked at at Neverland?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And who did you think had unfairly looked at your employee file?
Ralph Chacon: The OSS, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: That's Mr. Jackson's personal security guards?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have any idea why they were suspicious of you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: They were, weren't they?
Ralph Chacon: I don't know, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever talk to them about why they wanted to see what was in your personnel file?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, I approached them.
Mr. Mesereau: This was around the time you went to a tabloid, wasn't it?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: This was around the time you went to Mr. Ring, wasn't it?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: It was very close to the time you left employment at Neverland, wasn't it?
Ralph Chacon: I believe so, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember saying you thought Mr. Jackson should compensate you for the rest of your life?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to show you your deposition transcript?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach?
The Court: Yes.
Ralph Chacon: Where is the beginning? Oh, I must have, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page in your deposition?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection that you testified under oath that you thought Mr. Jackson should compensate you for the rest of your life?
Ralph Chacon: I must have said that, yes, sir, because it's on there.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, was it the policy at Neverland to notify the local sheriffs if an intruder was caught on the property?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you personally notify the sheriffs at any time about an intruder being on the property?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall you personally apprehending any intruders?
Ralph Chacon: Myself and Abdool, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And what happened?
Ralph Chacon: There was an intruder that came behind the pool area. It was a reporter. And we just apprehended him and took him down to the front gate and probably the security at the gate called the sheriffs.
Mr. Mesereau: The pool area is right next to Mr. Jackson's house, isn't it?
Ralph Chacon: Around the area, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And how many people did you apprehend on that occasion?
Ralph Chacon: One. One, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: How far did that intruder have to travel to get to the pool area?
Ralph Chacon: I don't know which direction he came in, sir. Could have been -- could have been a mile, two miles, three miles. I don't know, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you also were involved in some other situations where intruders tried to get to Mr. Jackson, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And please describe those events.
Ralph Chacon: Kind of vague, but I believe there was two -- two young people, a male and a female, I believe, and they were up by -- they were up by the -- by the theater.
Mr. Mesereau: The theater would be up near the zoo area?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And who caught them?
Ralph Chacon: I believe it was mobile. I don't know who it was that was on mobile that evening, that night, but it was mobile patrol.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever steal a watch from Mr. Jackson?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Were you ever accused of that?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You mentioned candy bars earlier, remember?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you think the jury awarded Mr. Jackson $25,000 against you because you took candy bars?
Ralph Chacon: That's what --
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object as argumentative.
Mr. Mesereau: I have no further questions, Your Honor.
The Court: Redirect?
Mr. Sneddon: Yes.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. SNEDDON:
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's go back just for a second. Mr. Chacon, were you subpoenaed to be here this morning?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: You're under subpoena?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you want to come testify?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: When you testified before the grand jury, were you under subpoena?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you want to testify?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Prior to your appearance before the grand jury, you told the ladies and gentlemen that you met with attorneys for Mr. Jackson; is that correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to that conversation, did they want to know what you were going to say?
Ralph Chacon: They did.
Mr. Sneddon: And what did you tell them?
Ralph Chacon: I said that I got subpoenaed, and if I got subpoenaed, that I would just speak the truth, but I didn't tell them what I knew, but they wanted to know.
Mr. Sneddon: They wanted to know, but you wouldn't tell them?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: But you told them you were going to tell the grand jury the truth?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you do that?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to Mr. Mesereau saying that you added something to the events that occurred yesterday when you and I were talking, do you recall him asking you that question?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: The new information you provided yesterday had nothing to do with the two events you've described to the jury, had they?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: There was nothing that changed about that, was there?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: In fact, the event that you indicated -- there was -- something that you remembered was something you were told by another person; wasn't that correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And who was that other person?
Ralph Chacon: Abdool.
Mr. Sneddon: It was in no way connected to the testimony you gave concerning the two incidents you observed?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard -- just so the jury has a clear indication of the sequence here, you were subpoenaed to appear before the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you actually gave your statement under oath, was there a line of jurors like this in the room?
Ralph Chacon: Back in ninety --
Mr. Sneddon: '94, when you came in.
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, how long after that was it that Mr. Ring became involved in the civil lawsuit? Let me put it this way: After you appeared before the Santa Barbara Grand Jury and gave a statement under oath, do you recall that?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And you went back to work at the ranch, did you not?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And you worked at the ranch, Neverland Valley Ranch, for a while before you left there, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Probably a month or so, or two. I'm not positive.
Mr. Sneddon: Was it at that point that you became involved in the lawsuit with Mr. Ring?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Whose idea was it to go to the tabloid for the story?
Ralph Chacon: Well, we probably talked about it, but we talked to Mr. Ring about it. I guess it was all of us in general.
Mr. Sneddon: After you -- Mr. Mesereau asked you about your salary at the ranch. Do you recall that?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And you spoke about being dissatisfied with the wages that you were getting --
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: -- compared to some people that had been hired afterward, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: After your conversations with Mr. Sanger and Steve Cochran about your grand jury appearance, were you offered a raise?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, I was.
Mr. Sneddon: And it was before your testimony actually occurred before the grand jury, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: So it was in between the time they found out you were going and the time that you actually appeared they offered you a raise?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And Mr. Kassim also, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Actually, it's Mr. Abdool.
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the course of the -- let me ask you this: After you testified before the grand jury and gave your statement under oath about what you saw happen on those two incidents - okay? - did you receive threats?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: In what form?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; beyond the scope.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, it's what led to the lawsuit. And counsel was allowed to go into that.
The Court: All right. With that representation, I'll change my ruling.
Ralph Chacon: Could you --
Mr. Sneddon: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: You said you were threatened. In what form?
Ralph Chacon: Verbally, and -- well, verbally, and somewhat physically by someone touching their -- Tony Coleman touching his weapon.
Mr. Sneddon: Tony Coleman was who?
Ralph Chacon: He was OSS.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Would you describe to the jury -- if you have to stand up, do it. Describe to the jury what Mr. Coleman did.
Ralph Chacon: We were in the security office, and we were arguing about an intruder that came in, and he wanted to do it his way. And I said, “If you do it that way, we're going to” -- “it's not the procedure”. And then he says, “Well, I'm going to do it my way because I'm here to oversee you”. And he touched -- he pulled his coat back and he touched his weapon, and he says, “I'm in charge here”. I believe that's the words he used.
Mr. Sneddon: Did he at any other time ever use his weapon to indicate a threat towards you?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir, that was about the first time.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever receive any phone calls of any kind that were threatening?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you report those to law enforcement?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, I did, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: How many occasions did that occur?
Ralph Chacon: Several times. One time when we first started, somebody says --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; nonresponsive
The Court: After “several times”, sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Tell us about those threats that you received.
Ralph Chacon: The first time I received it, they said, “I'm going to kill you”.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, goes to the state of mind and to the reason for the lawsuit.
The Court: I'm going to overrule the objection as to state of mind.
Mr. Sneddon: Go ahead.
Ralph Chacon: Someone called and said, “I'm going to kill you”, and hung up. And then other times we had calls at the house where they would either laugh or wouldn't say words, but we knew that someone was -- I believe it was OSS behind this.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you as a result -- did you take these things seriously?
Ralph Chacon: Oh, yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you approach anyone with regard to obtaining a gun permit?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And who did you approach?
Ralph Chacon: I asked Mr. Birchim and yourself for a gun permit. So I carried a concealed weapon permit for about two years, I believe it was.
Mr. Sneddon: You indicated that you may have asked Sergeant or now Commander Birchim for money for your wife --
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: -- do you recall? Do you remember why that was?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Why was that?
Ralph Chacon: Well, my wife's sister-in-law had just died, and --
Mr. Sneddon: That's all right, I'll withdraw the question. That's okay. It's not important. Mr. Mesereau asked you about - we'll turn to a subject a little easier - about my conversation with you yesterday --
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: -- with Mr. Birchim being there.
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And you told Mr. Mesereau how long the conversation lasted, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Was Mr. Birchim present during the entire conversation?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, he was.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there portions of time before Mr. Birchim got there that you and I talked a little bit?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Did we talk about anything about this case?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir. We talked about my military experience, and that you knew some people that I knew where I was born and raised.
Mr. Sneddon: Had nothing to do with the case during the time Birchim wasn't there?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; asked and answered.
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when we were talking yesterday --
The Court: Sustained. Go ahead. (Laughter.)
Mr. Sneddon: When we were talking yesterday and Mr. Mesereau asked you did I tell you what questions I was going to ask you today, do you recall him asking you that question?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: What was the question that I actually asked you; do you remember?
Ralph Chacon: I believe it was the incidents that took place, the two incidents that happened on the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: And I asked you just to describe them in your own words to me?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: And Sergeant -- or Commander Birchim was there during that entire time?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, he was.
Mr. Sneddon: Mr. Mesereau mentioned something about an individual called Victor Gutierrez. Do you remember that?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Were you ever paid any money by Mr. Gutierrez?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever give him a statement at all?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: You indicated that the individuals who were on the ranch that were armed were called the OSS. Was that their official name, or was that a name that the security staff gave them?
Ralph Chacon: I believe that's -- it was used for them as a short title. Office of Special Services, but they used it as -- just call them OSS.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to -- you told the jury that they interfered with you on how you did your job. In what respect? I mean, what was the tension or the friction between the two of you?
Ralph Chacon: They just -- they just interfered in every aspect of our duty as security there. They would break the beams, the security beams, and they would cause us to run out there thinking it was an intruder. They would come by and laugh, and just make jokes, and/or sit out in their vehicle and stare at us inside the security office.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the lawsuit itself that Mr. Mesereau has asked you a number of questions about, were you ever consulted about the amount of money that was going to be sued for?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Whose judgment did you leave that decision?
Ralph Chacon: Mr. Ring.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you legit -- did you feel, yourself, that you were entitled to some money from Mr. Jackson because of the way you were treated on the ranch?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you still feel that way?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Move to strike; relevance.
The Court: Sustained; stricken.
Mr. Sneddon: You told the jury that you knew that you were being -- your telephones on the ranch were being monitored, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: How did you know that?
Ralph Chacon: It was common knowledge that -- in the main office where Sandy Domz worked at, there was a computer paper printout that -- you could hear, and it printed out the phone calls as they were made, either going out or coming in.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, just a couple of more questions. With regard to the lawsuit, the trial, the civil lawsuit, were you -- or did you -- during that lawsuit, were you allowed or permitted to testify concerning the incidents you told this jury about this morning in that lawsuit?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir. As a matter of fact, the judge said if I -- if we --
Mr. Sneddon: You just weren't allowed to?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Mr. Chacon, is there anything that you've told this jury this morning about what you saw out there on those two incidents that is anything but the truth?
Ralph Chacon: It's the truth, sir.
Mr. Sneddon: No further questions.
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Chacon, the prosecutor has just asked you to talk about problems you had with the OSS, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And the OSS was a nickname someone developed to call Mr. Jackson's personal bodyguards?
Ralph Chacon: They themselves, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You wanted money to be awarded to you from a Santa Maria jury because of your problems with the personal security guards of Mr. Jackson, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Your claims were rejected, true?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You also claimed at the time $16 million wasn't enough for you, right?
Ralph Chacon: I probably did, sir. Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor just asked you if you knew anything about the amounts you were seeking, and of course you did, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You wanted money because you claim that people were calling your home and hanging up, correct?
Ralph Chacon: That was part of it, sir, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And a Santa Maria jury rejected that claim, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You said that someone named Coleman had put his hand on his gun because he didn't like the way you wanted to handle an intruder; is that correct?
Ralph Chacon: No, because he wanted to handle it.
Mr. Mesereau: He was a personal security guard, correct?
Ralph Chacon: OSS. Not a security guard.
Mr. Mesereau: He was carrying a -- well, this group you call the OSS, they're bodyguards for Mr. Jackson, right?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir, they are.
Mr. Mesereau: And they were carrying weapons, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And he was concerned about the intruder, correct?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: You sued also claiming you should get money because of what Mr. Coleman did on that day, correct?
Ralph Chacon: He threatened me, yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was rejected by a Santa Maria jury as well, correct?
Ralph Chacon: Yes, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: And you wanted money because you said Mr. Jackson stared at you on occasion, correct?
Ralph Chacon: No, sir.
Mr. Mesereau: Why did you say it?
Ralph Chacon: Just to say it.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions.
Mr. Sneddon: No questions, Your Honor.

Adrian McManus: I work in a jewelry department where I sell diamonds.
Mr. Zonen: Is this a department store?

Mr. Zonen: Okay. Have you worked in that department the entire time?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Have you worked in other departments in that store as well?

Adrian McManus: I worked for Sears, and I ran -- I was in the cosmetic department.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever work for Michael Jackson?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you see Michael Jackson in this courtroom?
Adrian McManus: I don't have my glasses. I forgot them upstairs.
Mr. Zonen: How far can you see?
Adrian McManus: I can't see real far.
Mr. Zonen: Can you see me?
Adrian McManus: Yeah, blurry.
Mr. Zonen: I won't ask that question, then. Can you read, in the event we need to show you some documents?
Adrian McManus: No, I need to get my glasses.
Mr. Zonen: We're going to have a break in a few minutes. I'll reserve all those questions until we have that break. You did work for Michael Jackson at some point, did you not?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: For what period of time did you work for Michael Jackson?
Adrian McManus: From, I think, August 29th of 1990 through July 31st of 1994.
Mr. Zonen: In what capacity? What kind of work did you do for Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: At the beginning I was just a maid, regular housekeeper. Nine months later I was cleaning his bedroom.
Mr. Zonen: And did you continue that job for the duration of your employment?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Were you the only person cleaning his bedroom?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Tell me how that worked. Why were there not other people involved in cleaning his bedroom as well?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: What were you told about who would be cleaning his bedroom?
Adrian McManus: I was just told that I was flexible and that I was the one to clean his bedroom.
Mr. Zonen: And that was that entire time after a few months after you commenced working for Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: So it was early '91?
Adrian McManus: I just know it was nine months after, because I started in '90, and --
Mr. Zonen: Now, up to that point, you were responsible for cleaning other locations at Neverland; is that correct?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What were those other locations? Tell us what your job included.
Adrian McManus: Before that time?
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Cleaning the rec room, the ranch house, the guest units, the hill house, the main house, except his bedroom at that time.

Adrian McManus: Blanca Francia.
Mr. Zonen: And did you know Blanca Francia?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Were you the one who took over that job when she left?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you take over that job as soon as she left?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Describe to us what those responsibilities included, cleaning --
The Court: Let's take a break.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you. Where we left off before the break, I was asking you about your responsibilities, once you assumed the position of being the personal maid for Michael Jackson. And before I get to that, do you have your glasses?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Is Mr. Jackson here in the courtroom?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Could you identify him, please?
Adrian McManus: He's right here.
Mr. Zonen: And the record should reflect.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What were your responsibilities as his personal maid?
Adrian McManus: To pick up after Mr. Jackson, anything to do with his clothes, his -- washing his clothes, fixing his bed, cleaning his bedroom.
Bailiff Cortez: I'm sorry, can you speak more into the microphone?
Mr. Zonen: You have to stay fairly close to the microphone to be able to be heard all the way to the back of the courtroom, if you will. Describe his bedroom suite for us, please.
Adrian McManus: It was a very big room. There was a second level to it. There was a Jacuzzi on one side with a bathroom. A closet. Inside that closet was a secret closet. The other side of the room there was a bathroom also, and another walk-in closet, and there was a stairway that led up to the second level.
Mr. Zonen: Were your responsibilities limited to that suite?
Adrian McManus: At one time, yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. What if Mr. Jackson was gone for a while, if he was on tour, or out of town for a period of time, what would you do?
Adrian McManus: I still had to pick up the room, as far as keeping it dusted, and brassing, and cleaning the tub. There was still a lot to do.
Mr. Zonen: Were there responsibilities that went beyond the suite on those occasions?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did Mr. Jackson have monkeys during that period of time, or apes, or chimps, or --
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: -- primates?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Were they living in his room?
Adrian McManus: They weren't living in his room, but they were brought into his room.
Mr. Zonen: Were there cages for them?
Adrian McManus: Some -- well, when I seen them, they were running around.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever see cages in his room?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall seeing cages in the room.
Mr. Zonen: Were you, on occasion, required to tend to the monkeys or clean up after the monkeys?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And describe what that obligation was.
Adrian McManus: Well, there was a little monkey, a chimp, and --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Relevance, Counsel?
Mr. Zonen: I'll withdraw the question. Let me move on.
Mr. Zonen: Were you the personal maid for the balance of time that you were there?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Do you know a person by the name -- or did you know a person by the name of Wade Robson?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Who was Wade Robson?
Adrian McManus: He was a little boy that used to go to the ranch, and he was from Australia.
Mr. Zonen: How old was he when you saw him at the ranch?
Adrian McManus: I don't know exact. Maybe 10, 11.
Mr. Zonen: Now, you have a son, do you not?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And your son at that time was approximately how old?
Adrian McManus: Maybe ten.
Mr. Zonen: About the same age as Wade Robson?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did your son ever come with you to Neverland Ranch?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: On many occasions?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did your son know Wade Robson?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did they, on occasion, play together?
Adrian McManus: Off and on.
Mr. Zonen: For what period of time did you see Wade Robson there at the ranch; do you recall?
Adrian McManus: Are you talking about, like, months or --
Mr. Zonen: Well, for what period of time did Wade Robson visit the ranch?
Adrian McManus: Are you talking about years or just the timing, like?
Mr. Zonen: From the earliest time that you saw him visit to, say, the last time you saw him visit, if you can recall, give us a sense of what period of time that was.
Adrian McManus: I would say probably 1992. I don't know how many months.
Mr. Zonen: And did you see him there for a long period of time?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: How often did he visit during that period of time? In other words, how many separate times did he come, to your recollection?
Adrian McManus: There were a lot of times. Come maybe for a week or the weekend.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And that was my next question.
Adrian McManus: Sorry.
Mr. Zonen: How long would he stay when he did come?
Adrian McManus: Sometimes a weekend, sometimes maybe a little longer.
Mr. Zonen: And during that period of time, where did -- where did Wade Robson stay when he was at the house, when he was at the ranch?
Adrian McManus: In Mr. Jackson's room.
Mr. Zonen: Were you the personal maid for Mr. Jackson during the entire time that Wade Robson visited?
Adrian McManus: I believe so. Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Let me change that again. During the period of time that you were the personal maid, was Wade Robson visiting that entire time?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. I think you said among your responsibilities were to pick up after Mr. Jackson and wash clothing. Do you have a recollection as to whether or not you saw Wade Robson's personal possessions?
Adrian McManus: Sometimes.
Mr. Zonen: And I asked you where Wade Robson stayed, and you said Mr. Jackson's room. Do you know where he stayed in the room?
Adrian McManus: In the same bed as Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Were there other beds in Mr. Jackson's suite during that period of time?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Where were the other beds?
Adrian McManus: There was one upstairs in like -- I don't know if you'd call it -- in like a loft.
Mr. Zonen: Was that bed ever used?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Do you have a recollection of ever changing sheets on that bed?
Adrian McManus: I did, you know, just to keep it kind of up, but not always.
Mr. Zonen: Do you have a recollection of anybody ever seeping in that bed; in other words, coming in and discovering that those sheets had simply been used, the bed had been used?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: How often?
Adrian McManus: Maybe -- maybe once.
Mr. Zonen: During the entire time that you were the personal maid for Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you know Wade Robson's parents, mother or father?
Adrian McManus: I don't ever remember meeting a father, but I remember the mother.
Mr. Zonen: And where did she stay when they were there?
Adrian McManus: In the guest unit.
Mr. Zonen: Did Wade Robson have any brothers or sisters who came?
Adrian McManus: Not that I recall.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know if Wade Robson's mother ever stayed in Mr. Jackson's residence?

Adrian McManus: Sometimes a week. Sometimes longer.
Mr. Zonen: Did he visit frequently during that period of time?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was he ever there during the period of time that Wade Robson was there?

Mr. Zonen: It was a large family?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever meet his parents?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Would all of them come to the ranch on occasion?
Adrian McManus: Sometimes.
Mr. Zonen: Were there occasions when Macaulay Culkin came by himself?
Adrian McManus: Sometimes.
Mr. Zonen: And on those occasions when he came by himself, how long, typically, would he stay?
Adrian McManus: The weekend. Sometimes his parents would show up later and they'd be there maybe a week.
Mr. Zonen: How old was Macaulay Culkin when he was visiting the ranch during that period of time?
Adrian McManus: Maybe 11. 10 or 11 maybe.
Mr. Zonen: At the earliest -- you gave us a period of time that was over two or three years. What was the youngest age you remember seeing him, as best you can recall?
Adrian McManus: Maybe ten.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Was Macaulay Culkin -- do you know him to be an actor?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Have you seen things that he's been in, movies or television?
Adrian McManus: Maybe one.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know where Macaulay Culkin stayed when he was at the ranch?
Adrian McManus: In Mr. Jackson's room.
Mr. Zonen: And as I had asked previously, do you know where in Mr. Jackson's room he stayed?
Adrian McManus: In his bedroom, in his bed.
Mr. Zonen: And how do you know that?
Adrian McManus: Because when I would -- when I would go in the room the next day, there was just one bed that I had to fix.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know if Macaulay Culkin and Wade Robson's visit would overlap on occasion, when both would be there at the same time?
Adrian McManus: Can you repeat that?
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry?
Adrian McManus: Can you repeat it?
Mr. Zonen: If their visits would overlap, if they would be there at the same time. Do you have a recollection of seeing Macaulay Culkin and Wade Robson there at the same time?
Adrian McManus: I could have.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know where Macaulay Culkin's family stayed when they were at the ranch?
Adrian McManus: Usually at the guest units.
Mr. Zonen: And the guest units were a separate building?

Adrian McManus: Not that I know of.
Mr. Zonen: Who is Jordan Chandler?
Adrian McManus: He's another little boy that used to come to the ranch.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know what period of time he used to come to the ranch?
Adrian McManus: Maybe '93.
Mr. Zonen: Was it for as long a period of time as Mr. Culkin, Macaulay Culkin came to the ranch?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Can you tell us the period of time that Jordan Chandler visited at Neverland? In other words, at what time did it commence and at what time did it end, if at all, during your period of employment?
Adrian McManus: Maybe 1993 and maybe through '94. Maybe early, maybe late -- actually, maybe late '93.
Mr. Zonen: Who is Brett Barnes?
Adrian McManus: Another boy that used to come to the ranch.
Mr. Zonen: How old was Brett Barnes when he visited?
Adrian McManus: Probably maybe 11.
Mr. Zonen: For what period of time did Brett Barnes come to the ranch?
Adrian McManus: He was there quite a lot. Mid -- maybe 1993.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know approximately what period of time Brett Barnes would come and visit? In other words, over what period of time, measured in months, measured in years, measured in weeks, from the first visit to the last?
Adrian McManus: I would -- I'm thinking maybe 1992 through maybe 19 -- late 1993.
Mr. Zonen: When Brett Barnes came to the ranch, did he come with family?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And who in his family did he come to the ranch with?
Adrian McManus: With his mother and his sister.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever meet Brett Barnes' father?
Adrian McManus: I don't believe there was a father in that picture. I have never seen a father.
Mr. Zonen: Brett Barnes has a sister, you say, who came?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: How old was she?
Adrian McManus: I would say maybe 13.
Mr. Zonen: How frequently did Brett Barnes come to the ranch during that period of time?
Adrian McManus: A lot.
Mr. Zonen: And by “a lot”, what do we mean? Would it be more than one visit a month?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And when he came, how long did Brett Barnes stay?
Adrian McManus: Sometimes -- sometimes a week. Sometimes less than a week.
Mr. Zonen: Where did he stay when he came?
Adrian McManus: In Mr. Jackson's room.
Mr. Zonen: Where did he sleep when he was there?
Adrian McManus: In Mr. Jackson's bed.
Mr. Zonen: Do you have a recollection at any time either fixing a bed for Brett Barnes that was separate from Mr. Jackson's bed or cleaning up after a bed separate from Mr. Jackson's bed?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: I had asked you about Jordan Chandler. When he came to Neverland Ranch, did he come with his family?
Adrian McManus: Jordan came with his mother and his little sister.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know how old the little sister was?
Adrian McManus: Maybe four.
Mr. Zonen: She was a small child?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever meet Jordan Chandler's father?
Adrian McManus: I never -- I never met -- I never seen his father around there. I never met him.
Mr. Zonen: During the visits when Jordan Chandler came, where did his mother and sister stay?
Adrian McManus: In the guest unit.
Mr. Zonen: And where did Jordan Chandler stay?
Adrian McManus: In Mr. Jackson's room.
Mr. Zonen: Consistently?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Where did Jordan Chandler sleep when he was in Mr. Jackson's room?
Adrian McManus: In Mr. Jackson's bed.
Mr. Zonen: Now, do you have a recollection of these four boys being there at the same time, Macaulay Culkin, Jordan Chandler, Brett Barnes, and Wade Robson?
Adrian McManus: Um, I -- I kind of recall Brett being there with Jordie, at the same time. And, you know, it could have been Wade also, when Brett was there.
Mr. Zonen: Would that have been a common occurrence?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Adrian McManus: Not always.
Mr. Zonen: Do you understand -- not always?
Adrian McManus: Not always.
Mr. Zonen: Do you have a recollection of specific events of all of them being there together or the two or the three that you mentioned?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Adrian McManus: I just recall seeing them there at the same time, Brett and Jordie.
Mr. Zonen: Brett and Jordie?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know how many times you saw Brett and Jordie there together?
Adrian McManus: At least two times.
Mr. Zonen: During the entire period of time that you worked as Michael Jackson's maid, personal maid, was it a frequent occasion that there would be one of those four boys there?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Overruled. The answer was, “Yes”. Next question.
Mr. Zonen: Was there ever an occasion that one of those four boys was there and did not stay in Michael Jackson's bedroom and bed?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Was there ever an occasion that you personally witnessed during the time that you worked as his personal maid when any of those four boys stayed -- and you were on duty, where they stayed in the guesthouse and not in Mr. Jackson's bed?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: As part of your obligations and responsibilities as the maid, did you clean up in the bathrooms?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was there a Jacuzzi in the bathroom?
Adrian McManus: It wasn't in -- yes, but --
Mr. Zonen: Am I describing the room incorrectly or inaccurately?
Adrian McManus: Yeah, because it wasn't really attached. It was just one room where the Jacuzzi was, and off to the side there was a bathroom and a shower.
Mr. Zonen: Just one second.
Mr. Zonen: During the period of time that you were working as Mr. Jackson's personal maid, did you ever see behavior by Mr. Jackson toward any of these boys that concerned you?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And which of the four boys are we talking about?
Adrian McManus: Macaulay Culkin, Brett Barnes and Jordie Chandler.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Let's begin with Macaulay Culkin. What is it that you saw that concerned you?
Adrian McManus: I was coming out of the bathroom by his bedroom, by Mr. Jackson's bedroom. I was cleaning that bathroom. And when I came out, I saw Mr. Jackson and Macaulay in the library, and Mr. Jackson was kissing him on his cheek, and he had his hand kind of by his leg, kind of on his rear end.
Mr. Zonen: Did they know that you were there?
Adrian McManus: I don't know --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; calls for speculation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Did you announce your presence to them?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Where were you at the time you witnessed this?
Adrian McManus: I was coming out of the bathroom by Mr. Jackson's bedroom.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Is that on the first floor?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Is that where you were?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Were they on the first floor as well?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you -- did you note that they were in the room or had come into the room?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were you surprised to see them?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Had you been cleaning in that room?
Adrian McManus: In the bathroom?
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: How did you come upon them? How did that happen?
Adrian McManus: I was leaving the bathroom, and when I walked out of the bathroom, I looked up and I saw.
Mr. Zonen: How far away from you were they?
Adrian McManus: I don't know the feet. It was a little distance.
Mr. Zonen: Between the distance that you and I are at this moment?
Adrian McManus: Maybe a little further.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Let's say to the back rail over here, behind me?
Adrian McManus: Probably a little further. Maybe a little further.
Mr. Zonen: Second or third row?
Adrian McManus: Maybe second row.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. And for the record, could we say that's 30 feet, 25? The second row?
The Court: I'm not testifying. (Laughter.)
Mr. Zonen: How far do you think that is in feet? Do you have any way of knowing?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: All right. You did not hear them come into the room?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: When you got to the position where you saw them, were either of them looking at you?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were either of them facing you?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: And you testified that you saw Michael Jackson kissing Macaulay Culkin?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; asked and answered.
Adrian McManus: Yes.
The Court: Just a moment.
Adrian McManus: Oh, I'm sorry.
The Court: The objection is sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Where did he kiss him?
Adrian McManus: On the cheek.
Mr. Zonen: And where did he touch him?
Adrian McManus: Kind of like by his leg, and it went to his rear end.
Mr. Zonen: And how long did that last?
Adrian McManus: I don't know how long. I just walked off.
Mr. Zonen: And you say you walked off.
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Walked off where?
Adrian McManus: I went to the laundry room.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Were you in a position where you could do that without being seen?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you leave the -- literally leave the suite?
Adrian McManus: I was in the rest room and I left the rest room.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Now, can you describe that for us, how you could do that without necessarily being seen or detected in his room? You didn't have to walk by them or anything?
Adrian McManus: No. They were at a distance, so I just walked through the hall.
Mr. Zonen: Did Mr. Jackson ever mention to you anything about that?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever mention anything to him about that?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Was that the first thing that you had seen in terms of behavior toward a child that caused you concern?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you see any other incidents that caused you concern in terms of Mr. Macaulay Culkin?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: What was the next thing that you saw that caused you concern?
Adrian McManus: Brett Barnes.
Mr. Zonen: And what did you see?
Adrian McManus: Well, I was up in the video room, and Mr. Jackson had me taking videos out of the wall. There was -- the room was a video room. It was actually a soldier room. And he had me taking all of the videos out of the wall, and there was like -- I don't know what you call them, like wood things that would hold the videos, and they had, like, screws in the wall. So I was pulling those all out because he had heard that you could see down into his bedroom.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; nonresponsive.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Move to strike.
Adrian McManus: So --
The Court: Just a moment. I'll strike from the point where she said, “So I was pulling those out”.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Why -- what were you pulling out from the walls?
Adrian McManus: Videotapes.
Mr. Zonen: Why were you doing that?
Adrian McManus: Because Mr. Jackson had heard that you could see down into his bedroom. There was like a little cubbyhole in the back of the walls up in that room, so he wanted to see if you could see down into his bedroom.
Mr. Zonen: So did you, in fact, remove videotapes?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Could you see down into the bedroom?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you show him that, or did he see that with you?
Adrian McManus: He was in his room, and where I was at was above his room, so he came up with Brett Barnes to that room.
Mr. Zonen: He came up to the room?
Adrian McManus: Up to the video room with Brett Barnes.
Mr. Zonen: While you were there?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And did you show him that spot while he was there?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Now, when did you see him doing something with Brett Barnes?
Adrian McManus: After that?
Mr. Zonen: Yes. Was it right after that?
Adrian McManus: It was kind of right after that, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: And where was he?
Adrian McManus: They were walking back down the stairs, and they went down through the hall by his bedroom, and I kind of followed because it was very hot up there in that room. And I was on the landing after you get on the stairs, and I kind of looked over the landing, and he was walking away with Brett to his room, and I saw him put his hand on Brett's rear end, and he gave Brett a kiss on the cheek.
Mr. Zonen: In like fashion to what you described you had seen with Macaulay Culkin?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Which of those incidents took place first, Macaulay Culkin or Brett Barnes?
Adrian McManus: Macaulay Culkin.
Mr. Zonen: How far away from them were you at that time? How far away from them? How far away?
Adrian McManus: With Brett?
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Oh, gosh, not that far. Maybe from where I'm at to maybe the third row back.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. I'm done estimating distances, so we'll leave it at that. All right. Is that the only incident that you saw with Brett Barnes?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you see an incident with anybody else?
Adrian McManus: With Jordan Chandler.
Mr. Zonen: And when was that?
Adrian McManus: Asking about the year?
Mr. Zonen: Relative to the incident that you saw with Brett Barnes.
Adrian McManus: God, I can't even think of the year. Probably '93.
Mr. Zonen: Was it toward the end of your employment there?
Adrian McManus: Maybe -- maybe -- a little, maybe.
Mr. Zonen: And what did you see?
Adrian McManus: I was up in Mr. Jackson's bedroom and I was -- I was on the second -- the loft area, and I was dusting. And I heard the chimes go off, so I knew somebody was coming into the bedroom.
Mr. Zonen: What does that mean, you heard the chimes go off? Where were there chimes?
Adrian McManus: There's like a sensor, like it rings. They're bells that ring when anybody's coming into Mr. Jackson's room, or if you leave the room, the chimes will go off.
Mr. Zonen: And when they go off, how long do they ring?
Adrian McManus: Until --
Mr. Zonen: If you walk through it, it will ring for how long?
Adrian McManus: For a while. For a little while, until I guess people are out of the area where you're seen.
Mr. Zonen: So once you clear, does it stop?
Adrian McManus: It will stop after, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: And the chimes going off meant what to you?
Adrian McManus: That somebody was coming into the room.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Was that an unusual occurrence while you were cleaning?
Adrian McManus: What, the chimes going off?
Mr. Zonen: Yes. Somebody coming into the room. If you were cleaning there during the day, would that startle you if that happened?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: What did you do?
Adrian McManus: Well, I was upstairs, and I -- I heard talking, like voices. So I knew it was probably Michael and Jordie.
Mr. Zonen: Now, “upstairs” means -- there's a second bed up there?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Like a loft you said?
Adrian McManus: A loft, uh-huh.
Mr. Zonen: Were you cleaning at that time?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Do you know if the bedroom door was open when you heard the chimes?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: And what happened then?
Adrian McManus: I kind of looked down from the stairs, from the stairs up there a little, and I saw Mr. Jackson with Jordie, and they were changing their clothes. Like -- I figured they were at the water fort. And I looked down and I saw Mr. Jackson kissing on -- on Jordie.
Mr. Zonen: What part?
Adrian McManus: His cheek, and then his mouth, and his hand was on his crotch.
Mr. Zonen: What was Jordie wearing at the time?
Adrian McManus: He had pants on.
Mr. Zonen: How long did that last?
Adrian McManus: I -- when I saw that, I was quiet, and I can't even say how long that lasted.
Mr. Zonen: What did you do?
Adrian McManus: I was kind of shocked, flushed, and I stood quiet where I was at.
Mr. Zonen: You didn't say anything?
Adrian McManus: I didn't say nothing.
Mr. Zonen: For you to go and leave that room where the loft is, you would have to walk down the stairs, would you not?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Would you have had to have walked past them?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. What did you do?
Adrian McManus: I stayed up there very quietly, I didn't say anything. I stood very quietly. And I waited for them to leave the room.
Mr. Zonen: And did they leave the room?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: How was Jordie Chandler dressed at the time?
Adrian McManus: I just remember he had pants on, and they were changing shirts. He had pants on and so did Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: And when you said his hand was on Jordie Chandler's crotch, on the outside of the pants or on the inside of the pants?
Adrian McManus: On the outside.
Mr. Zonen: Was he kissing him the entire time that you were watching?
Adrian McManus: From what I saw, yes.
Mr. Zonen: Where exactly were you at the time that you heard the chimes?
Adrian McManus: Upstairs in the top loft.
Mr. Zonen: And do you know where in that room?
Adrian McManus: Kind of by the stairs. By the stairs. I was dusting the stairs.
Mr. Zonen: So right at the top landing?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you stay up there until Jordie Chandler and Mr. Jackson left the room?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you then go downstairs?
Adrian McManus: Yes. After I heard the chimes go off, I knew they had left, and I waited and then I left.
Mr. Zonen: How long after this happened did you leave your employment with Michael Jackson?
Adrian McManus: Well, I left July. I don't know, like, the months. I know I left July 31st of '94.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever see any incidents involving Wade Robson? You told us about Brett Barnes, and Jordan Chandler, and Macaulay Culkin. Did you ever see an incident involving Wade Robson?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: I started to ask you a bit ago about the Jacuzzi. There's a Jacuzzi that's located in the master bedroom suite. Describe for us where that is.
Adrian McManus: When you go into Mr. Jackson's room, right when you go down the steps, there's steps in his room, there's a rest room like on that side, like right-hand side, where if you go around his bed, there's another area where there's another rest room, and there's a Jacuzzi.
Mr. Zonen: How large?
Adrian McManus: Oh, God, it's big. It's big.
Mr. Zonen: Would it hold more than one person?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Comfortably?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was water kept in that Jacuzzi all the time?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: What were your responsibilities with regard to cleaning the Jacuzzi?
Adrian McManus: I would have to clean the Jacuzzi off and on, run the water in it. But there were times when I had to let the water out of the Jacuzzi.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And were there things in the Jacuzzi on occasion?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Like what?
Adrian McManus: Like Mr. Jackson's undershorts, and a little boy's undershorts.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know which boys had been staying there during that time?
Adrian McManus: A lot of the little boys were staying there at that time.
Mr. Zonen: You wouldn't know which boy's it was, the undershorts?
Adrian McManus: Brett -- it could -- Brett. Jordie. Macaulay. That happened frequently.
Mr. Zonen: They'd actually be in the Jacuzzi in the water?
Adrian McManus: They'd be in the water, or sometimes they'd be on the floor by the Jacuzzi.
Mr. Zonen: And these were underpants?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And you could tell the difference between the boy's underpants and Mr. Jackson's underpants?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have to clean them?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I washed them.
Mr. Zonen: Did you, on occasion, wash the children's underwear as well?
Adrian McManus: At times, yes.
Mr. Zonen: If it was left behind?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: You'd pick it up and wash it?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: These four boys during the time that they were staying at Neverland, how did their behavior -- how was their behavior?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
Mr. Zonen: As to “behavior” or as to “boys”? I'll object to the objection as vague. Or I'll reask the question.
The Court: Well, it's compound, I think.
Mr. Zonen: I'll reask the question.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Zonen: During the period of time that you were working as Mr. Jackson's personal maid, did you have an opportunity to observe the behavior of the children who were frequent visitors at Neverland Ranch?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And did that include the four boys that we're talking about so far?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did it include other children who were frequent visitors at Neverland Ranch?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And I'm not asking you questions about busloads of kids who would arrive for a day and leave at the end of the day. I'm asking about the ones who were Mr. Jackson's personal guests and who stayed for periods of time. Do you understand that?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Was there anything about that behavior that was unique, in your mind?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; relevance; and leading.
The Court: The thing I'm having a problem with is not the vague, but the fact that you're asking about all of the boys as oppose -- as to their behavior.
Mr. Zonen: I'll make that easier.
Mr. Zonen: Macaulay Culkin, what was his behavior like when he was at Neverland Ranch?
Adrian McManus: He was very, very wild.
Mr. Zonen: Describe what you mean by that.
Adrian McManus: For us maids?
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Adrian McManus: He was a lot of work when he -- when he was around there.
Mr. Zonen: What does that mean, “a lot of work”?
Adrian McManus: He was destructive. I mean, throwing popcorn at Mr. Jackson. Soda, from the top, being thrown at Mr. Jackson's head.
Mr. Zonen: The top of what?
Adrian McManus: At the top of the theater. Like a projection room way up on the top.
Mr. Zonen: Did you actually witness that?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: So there's apparently two stories at the theater?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And is the upper story open in such a way that you can actually have contact with somebody below you?
Adrian McManus: Yes. They will -- yes.
Mr. Zonen: Open in what way?
Adrian McManus: There were windows up in the top-top. I don't know if you call it a -- I don't know if it was called maybe a viewing room. And if you were up there, you had to take a stairway to get up to the top, and you could open these windows.
Mr. Zonen: What did you see him do?
Adrian McManus: He threw sodas. I had just made popcorn, because he asked for popcorn, and he wanted a soda. So I gave it to him. And he went upstairs, and he dumped it on Mr. Jackson's head, along with the popcorn.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did that create a mess?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Mess for you to clean up?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was that a unique event with regard to Mr. Macaulay Culkin?
Adrian McManus: Was it unique?
Mr. Zonen: Well, were you always cleaning up after him?
Adrian McManus: Yeah, but certain kids made it worse. And he was one of them.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Which other kids were a problem?
Adrian McManus: Jordie Chandler.
Mr. Zonen: What did Jordie do?
Adrian McManus: Um --
Mr. Zonen: Before I get to Jordie Chandler, let me ask you another incident about the popcorn and the soda. What did Mr. Jackson say to Macaulay Culkin when he poured popcorn and soda from the second story on top of him?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Zonen: Go ahead.
Adrian McManus: It was like a joke. It was funny.
Mr. Zonen: He didn't discipline him?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: He didn't tell him, “That's inappropriate”?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Nor did he help you clean up, I assume.
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: And Jordie Chandler, describe his behavior for us during the time that he was there.
Adrian McManus: He was rude.
Mr. Zonen: In what way?
Adrian McManus: Very demanding.
Mr. Zonen: In what way demanding?
Adrian McManus: Like if I was in the laundry room washing clothes, he'd come and say, “Where's my shirt?” You know, “I want my shirt”. Just not nice to where you ask, “Do you have my shirt?” Just kind of “Give it to me now”, like that.
Mr. Zonen: Was his behavior like that fairly consistently during the entire time that you were exposed to him?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Brett Barnes, how did he behave?
Adrian McManus: That little boy, I -- he was not a rude little boy. He was pretty well-behaved.
Mr. Zonen: The entire time?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Wade Robson, how did he behave?
Adrian McManus: He was kind of wild, too. Not as much as Macaulay. Just wild, tear everything up. Leave messes all over, you know. Just --
Mr. Zonen: Were you ever encouraged to discipline these kids in any way?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were you discouraged from doing so?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: In what way?
Adrian McManus: Well, I was told by Norma Stakos that --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Zonen: Her state of mind to explain her behavior.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever go up to any child and say, “Don't do that. That's inappropriate”?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever see any employee or hear of any employee go up to a child and say, “Don't do that. That's inappropriate”?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Other than Brett Barnes, was the behavior of the three children that you described consistently bad the entire time they were there?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did that include times when they were in the presence of Michael Jackson?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever hear Michael Jackson discipline them in any way or tell them not to behave in such a destructive fashion?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you tell anybody about the events that you saw, the three incidents that you testified to involving those three children, Brett Barnes, Macaulay Culkin and Jordie Chandler?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Who was the first person you discussed that with?
Adrian McManus: Lawyers I had. Lawyers.
Mr. Zonen: The lawyer who was representing you?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Which lawyer was that?
Adrian McManus: Michael Ring.
Mr. Zonen: Had you told anybody about those events prior to that?
Adrian McManus: I believe I talked to Kiki Fournier. I didn't even know -- I think it might have been after I -- it might have been after I had left.
Mr. Zonen: Now, you worked there, I believe you said, about four years; is that correct?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Why did you leave there?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Adrian McManus: When Mr. Jackson had that Jordie Chandler molestation case, whatever, bodyguards were brought -- brought to the ranch. They weren't the regular security people. These people were called OSS, Office of Special Services. And there were a lot of these guys, and they started harassing --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Narrative; nonresponsive.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Well, “OSS” stands for Office of what?
Adrian McManus: Of Special Services.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Who were these people? Do you know their names?
Adrian McManus: There was one, Jimmy Van Norman. Tony Coleman. Marcus Johnson. Jerome Johnson.
Mr. Zonen: Were these people armed with weapons?
Adrian McManus: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And they came to the ranch after the commencement of the Jordan Chandler investigation?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know when the Jordan Chandler investigation began?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was there a search that was conducted at Neverland by Los Angeles Police Department?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Were you present at the time that happened?
Adrian McManus: I -- yes, but I -- yes, but I had called in sick that day and I had to go back to the ranch.
Mr. Zonen: You had called in sick that day?
Adrian McManus: I was sick on that day.
Mr. Zonen: By coincidence, or you knew there was going to be a search?
Adrian McManus: No, I didn't know. I did not know. I just was sick and I called in sick.
Mr. Zonen: And had anybody heard of anything in advance of that search?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: There had been no talk about that at all?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Fair to say there was probably considerable talk thereafter?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Were you interviewed by anybody from law enforcement during this investigation?
Adrian McManus: Um --
Mr. Zonen: I think the question that I asked was, had you been interviewed by anybody from law enforcement during the course of that investigation?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you become aware of the fact that there had been a lawsuit filed on behalf of Jordan Chandler?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Were you called to testify in a deposition?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And did you, in fact, give a deposition to attorneys representing both Mr. Jackson and Mr. Chandler?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember who those attorneys were?
Adrian McManus: Larry Feldman, Howard Weitzman, and some lady named, I think, Jan Faye or --
Mr. Zonen: Were you still employed at Neverland during that time?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: During the course of that deposition, were you asked if you observed any behavior by Michael Jackson directed toward Jordie Chandler or anybody else that you thought was inappropriate or any form of sexual behavior?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: How did you answer that question?
Adrian McManus: I didn't tell the truth.
Mr. Zonen: What did you say?
Adrian McManus: I said I didn't see anything.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Why did you say that in this deposition?
Adrian McManus: Because when -- when I had taken over the job for Mr. Jackson's room, Mr. Jackson had threatened me.
Mr. Zonen: What did he say to you?
Adrian McManus: He had told me, “You know, Adrian, if you ever say or you do something that I don't like, all I have to do is tell Bill Bray or Norma Stakos, and they will take care of you, but it wouldn't come from me. “
Mr. Zonen: Were you concerned about that statement?
Adrian McManus: I was very concerned with that.
Mr. Zonen: That was what, three years earlier?
Adrian McManus: That was right when I took the bedroom.
Mr. Zonen: Why did you continue to work there after that statement?
Adrian McManus: I don't know. I -- I got caught up, I guess, in -- my husband was laid off, and we had a house payment, and I just stayed.
Mr. Zonen: What was your salary at Neverland?
Adrian McManus: I worked 40 hours a week, but I started at 7.50 an hour.
Mr. Zonen: What was your salary at the time that you left Neverland?
Adrian McManus: I left at 8.86 an hour.
Mr. Zonen: In the four years, your salary went up $1.80 an hour?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What hours did you maintain at Neverland? What was your schedule?
Adrian McManus: Sometimes 8:30 to 5:00. Sometimes 8:30 till one o'clock in the morning. You never knew, kind of, when you were going to go home.
Mr. Zonen: Every day you went to Neverland, you didn't know if you would go home at 5:00?
Adrian McManus: Right.
Mr. Zonen: How often was it that you were asked to stay after 5:00?
Adrian McManus: There were a lot of times.
Mr. Zonen: In a week period, how many days in that week would you expect to stay after 5:00?
Adrian McManus: You just never knew. It depended if there were guests. Sometimes it could have been two times. Three times. You just didn't know when you were going to go home.
Mr. Zonen: And you could stay actually until the early morning?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And then come back the next day at 9:00?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Were you ever asked to work weekends?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: If you were asked to work on an evening or on a weekend, and you didn't want to, would you just simply say, “I can't do that tonight”?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Why?
Adrian McManus: Because you were scheduled and you had to show up.
Mr. Zonen: Now, you started talking about OCC -- OSS. A little dyslexia here, excuse me. OSS. And you named the people who were involved in OSS; is that right?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Up until that time, had there been people armed at Neverland?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were each of those people armed with weapons?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: How was their behavior toward you?
Adrian McManus: They were terrible.
Mr. Zonen: How did they behave toward you? What did they do?
Adrian McManus: Jimmy Van Norman would --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague as to time and individuals.
Mr. Zonen: Let's begin with Jimmy, then. I'll withdraw the question. Ask you specifically about Jimmy Van Norman. All right. And from the time that he came on working until the time you quit was approximately how many months?
Adrian McManus: I would say maybe six or seven months, maybe.
Mr. Zonen: During that time, was his behavior toward you fairly consistent?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And describe things he would do to you, or with you.
Adrian McManus: He called my home one morning when I was still kind of asleep, and he woke me up with a phone call. And I was going to take my son to school that day. It was a Monday, I remember. And he said, “Adrian” --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Zonen: Goes to her state of mind and explaining her conduct.
The Court: The state of mind being why she left?
Mr. Zonen: And commenced a lawsuit.
The Court: All right. I'll overrule the objection.
Mr. Zonen: All right. What happened in this call?
Adrian McManus: He called my home early in the morning, and he said, “Adrian?” And I said, “Yes?” And he says, “You sound different”. And I said, “Well, I just woke up” You know, I hadn't had coffee. My voice was a little bit rough. And he says something about what kind of underwear I wear, and when was the last time I got “it”; that apparently I needed it.
Mr. Zonen: Did you recognize the voice when he called?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: Did he have to identify himself?
Adrian McManus: No, he didn't. But I knew it was him.
Mr. Zonen: What did you do when you said that?
Adrian McManus: I changed the subject, because I thought maybe Mr. Jackson needed something and maybe he was just calling to -- to get Mr. Jackson to talk to me or something. I didn't know.
Mr. Zonen: Did he ultimately communicate a message to you from Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: Sometimes -- not him, but sometimes the other ones would.
Mr. Zonen: But on that occasion, that particular call, did he ultimately communicate a communication from Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: No, he didn't.
Mr. Zonen: Did he ever tell you why he was calling?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Did you hang up that phone call?
Adrian McManus: Actually, he got another call, and the phone was ringing in the back, which I knew was a Merlin phone, because I knew the sounds of the phones, and he said, “Darn, I'll call you right back”.
Mr. Zonen: Did he call you right back?
Adrian McManus: He didn't call back.
Mr. Zonen: Had you received more than that one phone call from this person, Van Norman?
Adrian McManus: I did receive another call later, and I -- and I don't know the month. Right now I can't think of the month. And it was Jimmy, and he --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Zonen: Same reason.
The Court: Well, you know, I'm not getting to her state of mind either. All of that testimony I let in for her state of mind I let in at your request for her state of mind.
Mr. Zonen: Let me withdraw the last question and let me move on.
The Court: I need an offer as to why I've let other testimony in.
Mr. Zonen: Let me withdraw that question right now and move on.
Mr. Zonen: Did you quit your job at Neverland?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did quit.
Mr. Zonen: Why did you quit?
Adrian McManus: Because I was being sexually harassed. I had death threats. I was being chased in the house with a stun gun. More like abuse. And mentally I could not deal with it.
Mr. Zonen: Was this all the new collection of guards that had been brought in?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever talk with Mr. Jackson about what was going on?
Adrian McManus: I don't believe so, with that.
Mr. Zonen: And why not?
Adrian McManus: I believe he left. He had left later, maybe in February. And Marcus Johnson left with him with the bodyguards, but there was still bodyguards around, so Mr. Jackson wasn't really around where you could tell him, so --
Mr. Zonen: What made you decide to file a lawsuit against Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: When I realized that I didn't have to work in a job where I was being sexually harassed, and abused, and having to deal with death threats and --
Mr. Zonen: Did you talk with Mr. -- who was your attorney? Who represented you?
Adrian McManus: Actually, we had Michael Gray and Michael Barber, and we had Michael Ring and Kelly Frances.
Mr. Zonen: All from the same firm?
Adrian McManus: At the time, yes.
Mr. Zonen: Who was the lead attorney in that case?
Adrian McManus: Michael Barber. And Michael Ring (sic) ended up, I guess, getting out of it. I don't know what happened there, but Michael Ring ended up taking over.
Mr. Zonen: Michael Ring?
Adrian McManus: Michael Ring.
Mr. Zonen: Was he the one who tried the case?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: That case went on for quite some number of months, didn't it?
Adrian McManus: Yes, it did.
Mr. Zonen: Did you quit your job before or after seeking counsel from Michael Ring or any other lawyer?
Adrian McManus: I believe I quit my job first while I went out on doctor's care.
Mr. Zonen: You were not the only plaintiff in that suit, were you?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Who were the other plaintiffs?
Adrian McManus: There was Melanie Bagnall, Kassim Abdool, Sandie Domz, and Ralph Chacon.
Mr. Zonen: Was there a counterclaim that was filed against you? Were you accused of anything?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What were you accused of?
Adrian McManus: I believe of -- of, I think, taking Super Soaker water guns. Taking candy, balloons, posters, sunglasses.
Mr. Zonen: Were you accused of taking a drawing?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Tell us about the drawing.
Adrian McManus: The drawing, actually, I had found it in the trash outside by the rec room. It was a trash area there. And I had taken trash out from the house, from the kitchen, and I saw it in there. There was a bag out there, and it was just open and it was a sketch. It wasn't a big sketch. It was a small sketch.
Mr. Zonen: About how big?
Adrian McManus: Oh, gosh. Probably -- I don't even know. Maybe about that big. Maybe like that. It wasn't very big.
Mr. Zonen: Six inches by five inches --
Adrian McManus: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: -- something like that?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Adrian McManus: Yeah, something like that.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Can you give us an estimate on the record, the size of it? Because you were holding your hands out.
Adrian McManus: Maybe three-by-five. I don't know. Something like that.
Mr. Zonen: All right. You said you found it in the trash?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Where?
Adrian McManus: Outside. Outside by the rec room. There was a trash area back there.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know who did the drawing?
Adrian McManus: I didn't know who did it, but I thought -- well, maybe. I was really -- I don't know who did it.
Mr. Zonen: Who did you believe did it?
Adrian McManus: Um --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; calls for speculation.
Mr. Zonen: Explains why she took it.
The Court: Actually, you know, we're having the same problem that when Mr. Mesereau was asking questions. You seem to be going into the allegations in the Complaint, which -- the facts of the lawsuit, which I've said we can't do. So I'm going to ask you to go into a different area.
Mr. Zonen: All right.
Mr. Zonen: After many months in trial, was there a resolution to that case?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What happened?
Adrian McManus: We lost.
Mr. Zonen: Each of you?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: As to all counts?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was there a judgment against you?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: For a great deal of money?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: How much?
Adrian McManus: 1.6 million.
Mr. Zonen: Did you go into bankruptcy afterward?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: So that debt still exists today?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: You owe Mr. Jackson $1.6 million?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Is that for all the attorney's fees and the court costs?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Have you paid any part of that?
Adrian McManus: A lien was put on my paycheck when I was working at Sears and there was money taken out, but I don't recall how much.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Is there a lien currently on your paycheck where you currently work?
Adrian McManus: For the lawsuit?
Mr. Zonen: For this lawsuit.
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Do you anticipate that will happen?
Adrian McManus: I don't --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Calls for speculation; relevance.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Are you concerned that that will happen?
Mr. Mesereau: Same objection.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Had there been a deposition that was taken of you prior to the commencement of that lawsuit?
Adrian McManus: Do you mean like before, with Jordie Chandler?
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: In the course of that deposition, did you disclose the events that took place that you've disclosed to this jury?
Adrian McManus: No, I did not.
Mr. Zonen: Are you talking about the Jordie Chandler lawsuit, deposition?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was there a subsequent -- another deposition that was done in the lawsuit of your case, Kassim Abdool and everyone else against Michael Jackson and everyone else?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: In that deposition, did you disclose what you saw?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: At some point during the course of that lawsuit, either before the commencement of trial or during, were you involved with others in selling a story to a tabloid?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Which tabloid was it?
Adrian McManus: Actually, there was a man named Gary Morgan, and he was from Splash.
Mr. Zonen: What is Splash?
Adrian McManus: I don't know -- I don't know if he's affiliated with different -- I'm not even really sure. I just know that he sold stuff.
Mr. Zonen: But it was a tabloid?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: Did you actually have an interview with them?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did they give you money?
Adrian McManus: Me personally?
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Adrian McManus: They were -- well, can I explain, because I don't --
Mr. Zonen: Who did the interview? In other words, how many of the plaintiffs involved that you've identified did this interview?
Adrian McManus: Everybody was there, including our attorney.
Mr. Zonen: Did he participate in the interview as well, your attorney?
Adrian McManus: He was there with -- yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Who is it who negotiated what would be paid?
Adrian McManus: I believe Michael Ring.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have any say in that at all?
Adrian McManus: No, I didn't.
Mr. Zonen: Was it understood that some of the money would be going to you, or all of the money?
Adrian McManus: From what I recall, all of the money went into a trust in Michael Ring's name in order to fight the lawsuit against Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: Did any of that money actually go to you?
Adrian McManus: At one time, yes.
Mr. Zonen: And how much was that?
Adrian McManus: A thousand dollars.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know how much money in total was turned over to Michael Ring?
Adrian McManus: I would honestly -- I mean, my best recollection, I'd say probably maybe 32,000 or more.
Mr. Zonen: And did that go to finance the lawsuit?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Were you involved in another lawsuit at that time or prior to that time?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What was that?
Adrian McManus: Well, it had to do with my husband's sister-in-law.
Mr. Zonen: And what happened?
Adrian McManus: My husband was -- my husband had two half brothers. They had different fathers. And one of the half brothers was real close with my husband, and he ended up diabetic and he lost his eyes and his kidneys and they had him on dialysis. He went blind. And he was married, and his wife and him, I guess they had a very -- a relationship that wasn't very good. From what I understand, she started fooling around with a radio talk show guy, and she got pregnant --
Mr. Zonen: Tell us what happened with regard to the lawsuit.
Adrian McManus: I'm sorry.
Mr. Zonen: Who was suing who?
The Court: How many lawsuits are we going to cover? (Laughter.)
Adrian McManus: I'm sorry. We got sued.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. For what? The resolution of his estate?
Adrian McManus: Actually, my husband was left as a beneficiary, and my husband got kind of fed up with her. And that was a family thing on their side of the family. And I kind of just got drug into it, but --
Mr. Zonen: Did you have counsel representing you in this lawsuit?
Adrian McManus: No, we didn't.
Mr. Zonen: Was it a jury trial?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Was it a court trial?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: You were representing yourself?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was the other side represented by counsel?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was there a judgment entered against you or your husband?
Adrian McManus: I believe 17,000 from each one of us.
Mr. Zonen: Was this from money from the estate?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you pay that?
Adrian McManus: I made payments, and I don't even recall how much I made payments for. And then I couldn't do it no longer.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you lose your home in this process?
Adrian McManus: No. We sold our home.
Mr. Zonen: And are renting today?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know anybody in the Arvizo family? Do you know that name?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know a Janet Arvizo?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Gavin Arvizo?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Star Arvizo?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Davellin Arvizo?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: I had asked you earlier about a drawing. Was that drawing sold to someone during the course of your litigation?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And who was it sold to?
Adrian McManus: Well, actually, at Michael Ring's office, our attorney, Gary Morgan had asked if we had any photographs or pictures or something, and I said, “Well”, you know, “there's a sketch that I found, I found in the trash”. I told him, “You can have it”. It was just a sketch. It wasn't a -- it wasn't a Polaroid, you know, it was just ink. And I gave it to him. And I guess he went and sold it.
Mr. Zonen: Who sold it?
Adrian McManus: Gary Morgan.
Mr. Zonen: And Gary Morgan is who?
Adrian McManus: He's from Splash.
Mr. Zonen: Did you get any money for that?
Adrian McManus: Actually, I think that when -- I believe that's where that thousand dollars might have come from.
Mr. Zonen: From the sale of that picture?
Adrian McManus: I think so.
Mr. Zonen: Did you represent that as a drawing that had been done by Michael Jackson?
Adrian McManus: I believe I might have said it, that I thought it was done by Michael Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: Did you believe it was?
Adrian McManus: I did.
Mr. Zonen: Why did you have it in the first place? Why did you take it?
Adrian McManus: Because I found it in the trash and I figured it was in the trash, so if something's in the trash, I mean, somebody might not have wanted it.
Mr. Zonen: Did you take it because you believed he did it or did you take it because you liked it?
Adrian McManus: I took it because I liked it, because I liked to draw and I thought it was pretty neat.
Mr. Zonen: I'd like to show you a few exhibits, if I may. Counsel, you've seen these.
Mr. Mesereau: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: I'd like to show you Exhibit 797 and 798. What are those two exhibits, 797 and 798?
Adrian McManus: They're -- they're -- it's an exhibit of a note that Mr. Jackson had given me on an index card, along with $300.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Those are the two exhibits. One is the note and the other is what?
Adrian McManus: The $300.
Mr. Zonen: It's not actually $300 you have in front of you, is it?
Adrian McManus: Half.
Mr. Zonen: Well, it's a Xerox or a photocopy; is that right?
Adrian McManus: Right, a Xerox copy.
Mr. Zonen: Explain what that is. Where did that money come from?
Adrian McManus: Well, I have to tell a story in order for that to --
Mr. Zonen: Let me ask you a question and see if I can lead you in that direction. Who gave you the $300?
Adrian McManus: Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: When did he give you that $300?
Adrian McManus: After he had read my transcript from the Jordie Chandler deposition.
Mr. Zonen: All right. How did he happen to have your transcript from the Jordie Chandler deposition?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Did you give him that transcript?
Adrian McManus: Yes, because he called me at home and asked me --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Nonresponsive; move to strike.
The Court: I'll strike after, “Yes”.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you have a conversation with Mr. Jackson about your testimony during the Jordie Chandler deposition?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: And that was the deposition you previously told us wherein you denied that anything had happened that you had seen; is that correct?
Adrian McManus: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: All right. In the course of that conversation with Mr. Jackson, did he ask you if you had a copy of that transcript?
Adrian McManus: Yes, he did.
Mr. Zonen: Did he ask to see it?
Adrian McManus: Yes, he did.
Mr. Zonen: Did you give it to him?
Adrian McManus: Yes. Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: When did you give it to him? How long after that telephone conversation was it that you gave it to him?
Adrian McManus: I believe it might have been the next day.
Mr. Zonen: And how did you happen to have a copy of the transcript?
Adrian McManus: I had gotten it earlier than usual, than the usual wait for a transcript, and I believe I -- I believe I had called Jan, I think her name was Jan Faye, and then they had sent it to me, but I got it earlier than you would wait for a deposition.
Mr. Zonen: Had you already read that transcript before you gave it to Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: Maybe parts of it.
Mr. Zonen: What was your next conversation with Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: Are you talking about, like, on the phone or --
Mr. Zonen: Well, did you have a follow-up conversation about that transcript?
Adrian McManus: Yeah. He told me that he had read it.
Mr. Zonen: Did he give it back to you, the transcript?
Adrian McManus: Actually, I got it back. I told him I was going to take it.
Mr. Zonen: Did he give you anything?
Adrian McManus: Yes, he did.
Mr. Zonen: What did he give you?
Adrian McManus: The $300 and the little note.
Mr. Zonen: And the note says what?
Adrian McManus: It said, “Adrian, thanx for everything”.
Mr. Zonen: And the $300 were in what denominations?
Adrian McManus: In 100-dollar bills.
Mr. Zonen: Did you see anything unique about the hundred-dollar bills?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: What was that?
Adrian McManus: The serial numbers were all, like, in sequence, which was really neat, because I had never seen anything like that, and I thought that was really neat.
Mr. Zonen: How did you happen to have a Xerox copy of them or a photocopy?
Adrian McManus: Because -- I thought it was so neat that I photocopied it, because I had never seen anything like that, you know, the sequence of bills like that.
Mr. Zonen: Did you keep the money?
Adrian McManus: Actually, when -- when he gave it to me, I called him up at the theater, he was in the theater, and I told him I didn't want the money. And he asked me why. And I said, “I just” -- “I don't want the money”.
Mr. Zonen: He didn't give you the money in person?
Adrian McManus: He gave me the money, but it was in an index card and it was folded.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Adrian McManus: And he told me to read it, to open it. It was in his bedroom. He handed it to me in his room. And I didn't open it right away, because I was cleaning. And he kept saying, “Open it, open it, open it”. And I opened it after he left the room, and I saw the $300 and the note was all attached.
Mr. Zonen: And then you called him?
Adrian McManus: And I called them. He went to the theater and I called him.
Mr. Zonen: All right. What did you say to him?
Adrian McManus: And I told him, “I can't take that money”. And he said, “Why?” And I said, “I just can't take it”. And he said -- he kept asking, “Why?” And then he said, “Well, then give it to your son”.
Mr. Zonen: Did you do so?
Adrian McManus: I ended up giving my son some of the money, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Did you keep the balance of it?
Adrian McManus: I kept some money. I don't even recall how much.
Mr. Zonen: The Xeroxes that you're looking at, the one of the note itself, does that accurately reproduce the note?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Now, the other one that shows the three hundred-dollar bills, can you tell us why it only shows half of the $100 bills?
Adrian McManus: I don't understand the question.
Mr. Zonen: Well, as you look at that exhibit, do you see that only half of each $100 bill is depicted in that Xerox or that photocopy? Am I right?
Adrian McManus: Yeah, you're right.
Mr. Zonen: And tell me why that is. Tell me why the Xerox doesn't show the entire $100 bill.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
Mr. Zonen: Withdraw that question.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know why that is? When you -- go ahead.
Adrian McManus: Actually, when I photocopied, I photocopied both sides, you know, like the front side of the bills and then the back side of the bill. But in what I turned over in my deposition, the whole bills were there. I don't know why it's just half.
Mr. Zonen: You've never seen that before?
Adrian McManus: I've never seen this before.
Mr. Zonen: All right. To the extent that those are three $100 bills with consecutive numbers, do they appear to be the same $100 bills?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And they are, in fact, $100 bills with consecutive numbers; is that correct?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: I move to introduce both of those exhibits into evidence.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll object; no foundation. She did not recognize the document.
The Court: I'll admit the documents.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you.
Mr. Zonen: I'd like to show you some additional photographs, if I may.
Mr. Mesereau: Could I see those?
Mr. Zonen: Showing you a photograph previously identified as 793, do you recognize the person in that photograph?
Adrian McManus: Kind of looks like Brett Barnes, but I'm not sure.
Mr. Zonen: Do you believe that might be Brett Barnes?
Adrian McManus: Kinda, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: Let me show you the photograph in 795. Let's start with 794. Two different photographs. The first with the child on the top, and the second with a number of children on the bottom. Start with the photograph with the child on the top. Do you know who that is?
Adrian McManus: That's Brett Barnes.
Mr. Zonen: And then the photograph on the bottom, do recognize any of the four people?
Adrian McManus: I can't -- no. I can't tell if that's Brett. He was little. I just --
The Reporter: I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
Mr. Zonen: Speak into the microphone.
Adrian McManus: The first photo I believe is Brett Barnes. The second one I can't really tell.
Mr. Zonen: Let me show you Exhibit 795. Do you recognize anybody in that photograph?
Adrian McManus: Brett Barnes.
Mr. Zonen: And where is Brett Barnes in that photo?
Adrian McManus: Right here.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Who is he sitting next to in that photograph?
Adrian McManus: Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know the other people in that photograph?
Adrian McManus: I think it's Carly in the middle. They look different, though, from when I seen them.
Mr. Zonen: Carly is the middle person?
Adrian McManus: Yeah, the sister of Brett.
Mr. Zonen: And the mother to her on the right side of her?
Adrian McManus: Right.
The Court: We're going to break a little early. Take our afternoon break.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Zonen: I have just a couple more questions.
Mr. Zonen: Is there a wine cellar at Neverland?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And where is the wine cellar?
Adrian McManus: It's in the rec room, the recreation room.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Is that sometimes called the arcade?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: That's the building that's different from the residence?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Is there a door that secures the wine cellar?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Is that door kept locked, or was it kept locked during the time that you worked there?
Adrian McManus: It was always locked.
Mr. Zonen: Was it a key that opened that door or a combination lock?
Adrian McManus: It was a key.
Mr. Zonen: And do you know where the key was kept?
Adrian McManus: In the maids' room.
Mr. Zonen: And where was the maids' room?
Adrian McManus: In the main house.
Mr. Zonen: In the main house?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was there more than one key to the door?
Adrian McManus: I believe there was.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ever have occasion to go down into the wine cellar?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: For what reason?
Adrian McManus: To pick it up, clean. Just to make sure everything was cleaned up in there.
Mr. Zonen: And to do that, you have to first go get the key?
Adrian McManus: Right.
Mr. Zonen: All right. The room where the key was kept at that time, was that a room that was open to anybody in the public?
Adrian McManus: Well, it was the maids' room. The maids were usually in there. I mean, somebody could walk in there.
Mr. Zonen: But it wasn't a room that was generally one of the rooms on tour when people took a tour of Neverland?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Zonen: Was it a room that somebody lived in or simply worked in? You said maids' room. What is the maids' room?
Adrian McManus: The maids' room is just like where the maids would go to take a break. It had a rest room and --
Mr. Zonen: Do you know if there were any other keys at that time?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: And do you know who else had those keys?
Adrian McManus: I believe security at that time had -- in their office, they had a key to that.
Mr. Zonen: You would pick up in the wine cellar on occasion?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What would require cleaning in the wine cellar? What do you mean by “pick up”?
Adrian McManus: Like, to go in there and to make sure that everything is -- sometimes you would have to brass. There was a lot of brass out there, so we'd have to brass, like, the sinks. So they had -- the faucets were of brass.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Cleaning is what you mean?
Adrian McManus: Just cleaning, yeah.
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to show you two photographs already shown to counsel. These two photographs are No. 786 already in evidence, and No. 799 for identification, not yet in evidence. No. 786, first of all, take a look at this photograph and tell us what that is.
Adrian McManus: That's Mr. Jackson's bedroom where the Jacuzzi is.
Mr. Zonen: Is that the Jacuzzi that you were referring to when you were describing having to clean that Jacuzzi?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: 799, tell us what this photograph is.
Adrian McManus: This is the theater.
Mr. Zonen: Now, can you actually see windows up on that far wall on the theater?
Adrian McManus: Actually, you have the projection room right here, and there was a window right here, a room, a bedroom. There was two bedrooms. There was one on this side, and there was one I believe on the other side. And there was an area where you go up some stairs on the side and would take you up, up high where you'd be like in a viewing room. And the viewing room would have -- I'm trying to think if that's it up there.
Mr. Zonen: You're pointing right now to what?
Adrian McManus: I believe that is probably the viewing room up above. It was up above the bedrooms.
Mr. Zonen: You were previously describing testimony of popcorn and Coke being thrown through windows above --
Adrian McManus: Right.
Mr. Zonen: -- in the theater.
Adrian McManus: Right.
Mr. Zonen: Are those windows shown in that particular photograph?
Adrian McManus: I believe it's up here.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Now, that photograph that you're looking at - which I believe I said was 799 - 799, is the subject matter of that photograph accurately depicted in the photograph? In other words, does it accurately portray what's inside?
Adrian McManus: I believe so, yes.
Mr. Zonen: I'd move to introduce 799 into evidence.
Mr. Mesereau: No objection.
The Court: It's admitted.
Mr. Zonen: If I could publish 799 at this time.
Mr. Zonen: If you could, turn around and look at the screen behind you. And tell us, is that the photograph that you just viewed, 799?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I believe so.
Mr. Zonen: Is that the theater?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Now, on the desk in front of you, there's a laser pen, a laser pointer. If you can do that -- that's not it. That's it.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: Don't --
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: Show us the windows that you were referring to.
Adrian McManus: The window from up above?
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Adrian McManus: It would be up here.
Mr. Zonen: And that's the -- a viewing room?
Adrian McManus: I believe it was a viewing room, yes.
Mr. Zonen: And the stairway to get up there is where?
Adrian McManus: I believe it's on -- it used to be kind of like on the side as you're coming in the back out here. There was a stairway. It's been so long. I know there was a stairway on the side, and I'm thinking somewhere back here, that would take you up to the top.
Bailiff Cortez: Ma'am, you need to talk into that microphone.
Adrian McManus: I'm sorry.
Mr. Zonen: So you believe the stairway was on the side; is that what you said?
Adrian McManus: I believe it was on the side.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you. No further questions.
The Court: Cross-examine?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please. Your Honor.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Good afternoon, Miss McManus.
Adrian McManus: Good afternoon.
Mr. Mesereau: We haven't met. My name is Tom Mesereau and I speak for Michael Jackson.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor for the government mentioned a case you were involved in where you were sued by Rosalie Hill, correct?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You were sued by Rosalie Hill as the guardian ad litem for two children, correct?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: The children were Shane McManus and Megan McManus, correct?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And the prosecutor for the government mentioned that you didn't have a lawyer representing you, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And that case was not tried before a jury, right?
Adrian McManus: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: It was tried before a judge of the Santa Barbara Superior Court, correct?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: That was Judge Richard A. St. John, Judge of the Santa Barbara Superior Court, true?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And you and your husband testified before Judge St. John, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: You told them your position under oath, correct?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And after you told Judge St. John your position under oath, he found that you and your husband willfully and maliciously defrauded these children out of the money in the estate, true?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Judge St. John found that that money was to be held in trust for the benefit of those two children, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: He found that you and your husband dissipated those funds, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: He found that you and your husband violated that trust, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: He entered a judgment against you and your husband for $30,000 -- excuse me, 30,584.89, correct?
Adrian McManus: I believe so, but I believe it was -- I thought it was like separate, like -- I thought it was maybe 17 for me and 17 for my husband. Maybe -- I don't know. Maybe that's right, what you have there.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you Judge St. John's judgment?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that judgment?
Adrian McManus: Right here? Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about the amount Judge St. John awarded the plaintiffs against you and your husband?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. It was $30,584.89, which was principal and interest due, correct?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And after he entered that judgment, Judge St. John also awarded the plaintiffs attorney's fees, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: He signed a separate judgment awarding the people who sued you and your husband $5,085.27 in attorney's fees and costs, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And in that judgment, Judge St. John also found, again, that you and your husband had willfully and maliciously stolen the money from those children, right?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Now, that lawsuit was before you sued Michael Jackson, correct?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And who did you join with in your suit against Michael Jackson?
Adrian McManus: Kassim Abdool -- do you want the names?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please.
Adrian McManus: Kassim Abdool, Ralph Chacon, Melanie Bagnall and Sandie Domz.
Mr. Mesereau: And in that case you had a lawyer, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, you had a number of lawyers, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you've already identified the lawyers that represented you and the other people that sued Michael Jackson with you, correct?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, that case went to a jury, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That was a jury in this courthouse in Santa Maria, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: In that particular case, a Santa Maria jury held that you had stolen from Michael Jackson, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And they awarded Mr. Jackson $35,000 for what you personally had stolen from him, right?
Adrian McManus: The sketch that I found in the trash, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That was a sketch he had done of Elvis Presley, right?
Adrian McManus: Well, I thought it looked like Elvis Presley, but I don't really know for --
Mr. Mesereau: But you tried to sell it to a tabloid, correct?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You did sell it to a tabloid, correct?
Adrian McManus: Well, I gave it to Gary Morgan.
Mr. Mesereau: You sold it to a tabloid, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe he did.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know for sure?
Adrian McManus: I don't know who he actually really sold it to, but --
Mr. Mesereau: You certainly inquired at some point, correct?
Adrian McManus: I think I saw somewhere later that it was printed, but I don't remember like what, but it was printed.
Mr. Mesereau: But when you sold it, you believed it was a sketch by Michael Jackson of Elvis Presley, right?
Adrian McManus: I thought so.
Mr. Mesereau: And a Santa Maria jury held that you had stolen that from Michael Jackson, right?
Adrian McManus: That's what they thought, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was their verdict, true?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. There was a finding that you had acted with fraud and malice against Michael Jackson in that case, correct?
Adrian McManus: I believe -- you know, it's been so long, I don't remember, but probably.
Mr. Mesereau: You actually stipulated that you had engaged in fraud, oppression, and malicious conduct against Mr. Jackson, true?
Adrian McManus: You know what, I don't remember everything. It's been a while, but --
Mr. Mesereau: Would it -- excuse me. Would it refresh your recollection if I show you that judgment?
Adrian McManus: Sure. That's fine.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: May I see, Counsel? (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Mesereau: Let me withdraw the question and ask it again.
Mr. Mesereau: The jury found you had acted with fraud, oppression and malice against Mr. Jackson, true?
Adrian McManus: You know what? Honestly I don't really recall. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if you see the judgment?
Adrian McManus: Well, sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to read that judgment?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about the jury in Santa Maria finding that you had acted with fraud, oppression, and malice against Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That's what they held, right?
Adrian McManus: That's what they -- yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Now, the total amount -- excuse me, let me start again. The suit began when you and the others sued Mr. Jackson, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And after you and Ralph Chacon and Mr. Abdool and Ms. Bagnall sued Mr. Jackson, he responded with a countersuit, correct?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And the countersuit was an allegation that you had stolen property from him, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Mr. Jackson's suit was a response to your suit, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Everything began when you and Mr. Chacon and Mr. Abdool filed the action, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's the action where you were represented by Mr. Ring, correct?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. At the end of the case, there was a judgment signed by Judge Zel Canter of the Superior Court of Santa Barbara in Santa Maria against you and Mr. Chacon and Mr. Abdool and Melanie Bagnall and Sandie Domz for $1,473,117.61, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe it was more. I -- I thought it was 1.6 million each person.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you --
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: -- this? May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you.
Adrian McManus: Okay. All right. Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that judgment?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And does it refresh your recollection about the amount?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, do you recall that Mr. Jackson was entitled to have a hearing on what are called punitive damages after he won the jury verdict, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And Mr. Jackson agreed to waive that portion of the trial, correct?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: He did it in return for one dollar, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, the prosecutor asked you some questions about a deposition that you appeared at in the Jordie Chandler lawsuit, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And I believe you told the jury that you had lied under oath in that lawsuit, correct?
Adrian McManus: Can you repeat that? I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, sure. I believe you told the jury that you lied under oath in that lawsuit, correct?
Adrian McManus: What jury? During our trial?
Mr. Mesereau: No, let me start the question again. If you don't understand anything I ask you, don't answer, just ask me. I'll try and rephrase.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: In response to the prosecutor's questions, you told the jury that you had appeared at a sworn deposition in the Jordie Chandler lawsuit, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: That was a lawsuit that you knew Mr. Chandler's parents had filed against Mr. Jackson, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you appeared and testified under oath in a deposition, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were asked questions by a number of lawyers, including Larry Feldman, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: That deposition took place on December 7th, 1993, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes. Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: When have you last reviewed that deposition?
Adrian McManus: Actually, I never really went through it to really review it.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm sorry?
Adrian McManus: I never really went through it to review it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Before I ask you some questions about that deposition, when did you last talk to any prosecutor about your testimony in this trial?
Adrian McManus: Last night.
Mr. Mesereau: And who did you talk to about your testimony in this trial from the prosecution side?
Adrian McManus: Ron Zonen.
Mr. Mesereau: That's Prosecutor Zonen, who just asked you some questions?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did he talk to you about what you were going to be asked today?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it a phone call or a meeting?
Adrian McManus: A meeting.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did the meeting take place with Prosecutor Zonen?
Adrian McManus: In Santa Maria.
Mr. Mesereau: And how long did the meeting last?
Adrian McManus: A little over three hours.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Prosecutor Zonen give you anything to review before you testified today?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you review any documents to prepare for your testimony today?
Adrian McManus: Well, I -- I have my deposition from when I sued Mr. Jackson, and I did go over that.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, that's the deposition from your suit against Mr. Jackson, right?
Adrian McManus: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: That's not the deposition that you gave in the Chandler lawsuit, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, did you review the deposition you gave in your suit against Mr. Jackson to prepare for your testimony today?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: But you didn't review your deposition in the Chandler case to prepare for your testimony today?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Prosecutor Zonen ask you to review that deposition in your suit against Mr. Jackson to prepare for your testimony today?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he ask you to review any documents before you testified?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You spent three hours with him last night?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did that take place at the District Attorney's Office here?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did it take place?
Adrian McManus: Somewhere in Santa Maria, a home.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was Prosecutor Zonen the only one present, besides yourself?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Who else was there?
Adrian McManus: During that meeting?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please.
Adrian McManus: Russ Birchim.
Mr. Mesereau: That's a -- Russ Birchim, a Santa Barbara sheriff?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Was anyone else present?
Adrian McManus: Just them in the room.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And during those three hours, they went over what you were going to be asked today, right?
Adrian McManus: Well, they went over my depo -- Ron went over my deposition.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he point to specific pages in your deposition?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, your deposition is volume after volume after volume, isn't it?
Adrian McManus: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: How many volumes was your deposition in your suit against Mr. Jackson?
Adrian McManus: You know what? I'm thinking I was deposed for eight days. That's what I think.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Prosecutor Zonen bring a copy of that deposition with him to your meeting?
Adrian McManus: I think he had one.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did he appear to have all of the volumes to the deposition with him?
Adrian McManus: I really don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But he had specific parts he wanted to talk to you about, right?
Adrian McManus: Not really specific parts. Just kind of going through it, you know.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you go through all those eight days of deposition with Prosecutor Zonen in three hours?
Adrian McManus: I don't believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Who chose what portions of the deposition you were going to look at during the three-hour meeting, if you know?
Adrian McManus: I have no idea.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Correct me if I'm wrong, Prosecutor Zonen had portions of those deposition volumes he wanted to talk to you about, correct?
Mr. Zonen: Objection as to what he wanted to talk about. Vague and speculative.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Prosecutor Zonen point out certain portions of those volumes that he wanted -- that he appeared to want to discuss with you?
Mr. Zonen: Objection as to asked and answered and speculative as to what he appeared to want to ask.
The Court: I think you need to cut that question in half.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right.
The Court: I'll sustain the objection.
Mr. Mesereau: During your three-hour meeting last night with Prosecutor Zonen, you looked at seven or eight volumes of your deposition, right?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; assumes facts not in evidence that she looked at seven or eight volumes of anything.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Adrian McManus: I'm sorry, you lost me. Um, can you repeat it?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, sure. During your three-hour meeting last night with Prosecutor Zonen, you went through volumes of the deposition you gave in your suit against Michael Jackson, correct?
Adrian McManus: I don't know if it was volumes. It was just whatever page had opened, you know.
Mr. Mesereau: Who opened the pages?
Adrian McManus: It wasn't me.
Mr. Mesereau: It was Prosecutor Zonen, wasn't it?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And he seemed to have certain pages he wanted to talk to you about, correct?
Mr. Zonen: Objection as to what he wanted to talk about. Speculative.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Adrian McManus: I have no idea. I just was -- he was just going through it, period. I don't --
Mr. Mesereau: And was he asking you questions about what you said in that deposition?
Adrian McManus: No. He was just reading it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I'm going to ask you some questions about the deposition you gave in the Chandler suit --
Adrian McManus: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: -- on December 7th, 1993, okay?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember you said under oath that you trust Mr. Jackson and you would leave your son alone with him?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall any of that. I don't recall -- I don't know what I said, because I have not looked at that.
Mr. Mesereau: Might it refresh your recollection if I just show you that page?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance -- excuse me. Have you had a chance to look at those pages of your deposition?
Adrian McManus: No. Oh, right now? Yes, I'm sorry. Sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said in that deposition?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said words to the effect, “I trust Mr. Jackson”, and you would leave your son alone with him, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You were asked if you ever saw Jordie Chandler in Michael Jackson's bedroom and you said, “No”, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct, I believe.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you had never seen Brett Barnes sleep in Michael Jackson's room, right?
Adrian McManus: Probably. I can't recall everything in that.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you?
Adrian McManus: I hate to have you keep coming back, but that's fine.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said under oath in that deposition?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you had never seen Brett Barnes sleep in Michael Jackson's room, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't recall when you had met Wade Robson for the first time, right?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll rephrase it. I'll withdraw it.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember testifying under oath that you didn't recall when you met Wade Robson for the first time?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Adrian McManus: Um, actually, I don't -- I don't recall. I didn't go over that, so I don't --
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if you look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page of your deposition?
Adrian McManus: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about your saying you don't know when you first met Wade Robson?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember testifying you didn't know how many times Brett Barnes had been to the ranch?
Adrian McManus: Probably.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know if that's what you said?
Adrian McManus: I believe -- I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to look at the page?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you testified under oath you didn't know how many times Brett Barnes had been to the ranch, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember testifying under oath that you didn't know where Brett Barnes slept?
Adrian McManus: I probably did. I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Might it refresh your recollection if I show you the page?
Adrian McManus: (Nods head up and down.)
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said under oath about whether you knew where Mr. Barnes slept?
Adrian McManus: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And what did you say?
Adrian McManus: I believe I said, “I don't know”.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you knew you were under oath in this deposition, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Prosecutor Zonen discuss with you last night what you were going to say if confronted with this sworn deposition in trial?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did the issue of what you had said under oath in the Chandler deposition ever come up during the three hours you spent last night with Government Prosecutor Zonen?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember being asked under oath in that deposition if you ever saw Jordie Chandler's clothes at the ranch?
Adrian McManus: I believe that I do recall that.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember saying that you saw his mother bring them into Mr. Jackson's room in a suitcase?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember being asked questions by Mr. Feldman about the alarm system in Mr. Jackson's room?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall that.
Mr. Mesereau: Remember telling him, “People like to kill celebrities, so you have to be careful with your life”?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Would it refresh your recollection if I show you that portion of your deposition?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to review that page?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said under oath to Mr. Feldman on that subject?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You did say, “When you're a celebrity, you live a different life than regular people. I mean, people like to kill celebrities, so, you know, he has to be careful, you know, with his life”. And then --
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to object as to hearsay, reading from a deposition that's not inconsistent with current testimony.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, are you telling the jury that throughout this deposition you committed perjury?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; calls for a legal conclusion.
Mr. Mesereau: I believe it was raised on direction examination by the prosecutor, Your Honor.
Mr. Zonen: Not issues of perjury.
The Court: I'll sustain the objection to the question as phrased.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You told Prosecutor Zonen that you repeatedly lied under oath in that deposition, correct?
Adrian McManus: Are you -- what are you talking about?
Mr. Mesereau: When Prosecutor Zonen asked you some questions today in court, remember that?
Adrian McManus: Okay, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: He asked you if you had lied under oath in the Chandler deposition, right?
Adrian McManus: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you did, right?
Adrian McManus: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know how many times you lied under oath in the Chandler deposition?
Adrian McManus: I believe the whole time I did not tell the truth on that.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you believe you were committing a crime when you did that?
Adrian McManus: I really didn't. I really didn't think of it that way.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, let me ask you this: So far, you've admitted you lied under oath in the Chandler deposition for what, a day?
Adrian McManus: Well, throughout that -- throughout that deposition, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And Judge St. John found that you lied in that trial, right?
Mr. Zonen: Objection. Asked and answered; argumentative.
The Court: The objection is sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: And the jury found you didn't tell the truth in your suit against Mr. Jackson, right?
Mr. Zonen: Objection. Asked and answered; and argumentative.
The Court: Sustained. Mr. Mesereau, a few questions back, after you refreshed her recollection with the transcript about “you're a celebrity”, I sustained an objection, and I was incorrect.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: Do you want to reask that question? I'll reverse my ruling on that.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
The Court: So what had happened is she'd refreshed her recollection, and then you wanted to --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: Go ahead.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember I showed you the page of the deposition about what you said about “people try to kill celebrities”?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did that refresh your recollection about what you said on that issue under oath?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And as you recall, what did you say under oath on that issue?
Mr. Zonen: Objection; irrelevant.
The Court: Overruled.
Adrian McManus: I forgot.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show it to you again?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
The Court: What I'm going to do is let you read it to her. That's what I stopped you from doing. And I'll allow you to do it.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
The Court: And he's going to ask you if this is -- You ask her. (Laughter.)
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right.
Mr. Mesereau: Ms. McManus, this is what you said under oath: “But you have to understand now, when you're a celebrity, you live a different life than regular people. I mean, people like to kill celebrities, so, you know, he has to be careful, you know, with his life, and that little sensor benefits him for his life”. Remember saying that?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you weren't lying when you said that, were you?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, you knew that Mr. Jackson is very nervous about his personal security, isn't he?
Mr. Zonen: Objection. Speculative as to what he is nervous about; lack of foundation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Adrian McManus: Repeat it, please.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew when you worked at Neverland that Mr. Jackson is extremely nervous about his security, isn't he?
Adrian McManus: I really don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, when you saw his bodyguards, right?
Adrian McManus: Are you talking --
Mr. Mesereau: Huh?
Adrian McManus: Are you talking OSS or just security from the house?
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase it. I think I was too vague on that one.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: During the time you worked at Neverland --
Adrian McManus: Uh-huh.
Mr. Mesereau: -- was it your understanding that Mr. Jackson is someone who's very concerned about his personal security?
Adrian McManus: I really don't know. I mean -- I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew he had personal bodyguards to protect him, right?
Adrian McManus: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew they traveled with him when he went on tours around the world, right?
Adrian McManus: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew they were often armed, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you knew that he was always concerned about threats to his personal welfare, right?
Adrian McManus: I don't know about that. But, I mean, I don't want to answer that, because I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Did it ever occur to you that he might be concerned about his personal welfare?
Adrian McManus: I -- I don't know. I --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You testified under oath that twice you saw June Chandler bring her son Jordie's clothes in a suitcase into Mr. Jackson's room?
Adrian McManus: I don't know if it was twice. I know at least once. I don't remember what I said on that.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you that page?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page of your sworn deposition?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said on that subject?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you say?
Adrian McManus: Twice.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You testified that you saw Mrs. Chandler open the suitcase and take clothes out, right?
Adrian McManus: I -- you know what, I don't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember saying that she would sit down on the floor, take clothes out of the suitcase, fold them? Do you remember that?
Adrian McManus: Honestly, no, I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you that page?
Adrian McManus: Yeah. Sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page of your sworn deposition?
Adrian McManus: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said on that subject?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you say?
Adrian McManus: That she would fold the clothes.
Mr. Mesereau: That she would bring the suitcase and get on the floor and --
Adrian McManus: And fold the clothes, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Remember testifying under oath that you were never there at night when Jordie Chandler was in the room?
Adrian McManus: You know what, I don't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: Remember testifying you said you were never at Neverland at night when Jordie was there?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall that either.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you that page?
Adrian McManus: Sure. Probably, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page of your sworn deposition?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said about that subject?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you say?
Adrian McManus: That I wasn't there at night with Jordie.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, there were many occasions where Jordie Chandler, his mother and sister would come to the ranch and stay, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember what his sister's name was?
Adrian McManus: Lily.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever talk to Lily?
Adrian McManus: I don't believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know what his mother's name was?
Adrian McManus: June Chandler.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever talk to June Chandler?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What were your typical hours working at Neverland?
Adrian McManus: They varied, actually.
Mr. Mesereau: Was there a particular time you normally punched in?
Adrian McManus: Sometimes 8:30, sometimes 9:00 in the morning.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember testifying that you have never seen Mr. Jackson in bed?
Adrian McManus: I don't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: Might it refresh your recollection if I show you your deposition?
Adrian McManus: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said --
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: -- on that occasion?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you say?
Adrian McManus: That I didn't see him in his bed.
Mr. Mesereau: You'd never seen Mr. Jackson in bed, right?
Adrian McManus: Right.
Mr. Mesereau: What was your understanding about when you were supposed to be at Neverland to do your work?
Adrian McManus: Well, there was a schedule, and we kind of just followed the schedule. But then there were times that you didn't know when you were going to go home because of the guests being there late. So you come in at a certain time, but that didn't mean that you were going to leave at the time that you were scheduled.
Mr. Mesereau: So how would you learn what time you had to be there?
Adrian McManus: I believe there was a schedule that was made. You know, like supervisor would make it. And you'd be on the schedule at maybe 8:30 or 9:00, sometimes maybe till 5:30 or 6:00. But then, like I said, if there were guests, you didn't know what time you were going to go home.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember testifying you couldn't tell if Mr. Jordie Chandler ever took a shower with Mr. Jackson, right?
Adrian McManus: A shower with Jackson?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Perhaps.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you that page?
Adrian McManus: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you taken a look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what did you say?
Adrian McManus: I said I didn't -- I said I didn't -- I don't know, I just forgot. Sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you couldn't tell if Mr. Jackson ever took a shower with Mr. Jackson, right?
Adrian McManus: I couldn't tell. Right. Right.
Mr. Mesereau: You said you'd never seen Mr. Jackson in a Jacuzzi, right?
Adrian McManus: In a Jacuzzi, like taking a bath in a Jacuzzi, is that what you're talking about?
Mr. Mesereau: You said you had never seen Mr. Jackson in his Jacuzzi?
Mr. Zonen: I'll object as hearsay if it's not inconsistent with current testimony, also vague.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: You testified under oath that you'd never seen Jordie Chandler get ready to go to bed, right?
Adrian McManus: Perhaps. Like I said, I haven't gone over that, and I'm sorry.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you that page?
Adrian McManus: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what did you say about Mr. Chandler on that issue?
Adrian McManus: That I didn't see him ready to go to bed.
Mr. Mesereau: And you also said you'd never seen him get up in the morning, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: The prosecutor asked you a couple of questions about whether Mr. Jackson ever played with a pet monkey in his bedroom, right?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And I believe you said he had; is that right?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Was that chimpanzee's name Max?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: When you had your deposition taken in the Chandler case, you said you'd never seen a chimpanzee in his bedroom, right?
Adrian McManus: Perhaps.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I show you the deposition?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that page?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about what you said under oath at that deposition?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what did you say?
Adrian McManus: I said, “No”.
Mr. Mesereau: You said everybody plays with the chimpanzee but you've never seen it in Mr. Jackson's room, right?
Adrian McManus: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you work at Neverland when Blanca Francia was working there?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And how long did you work at Neverland when Blanca Francia was also working there?
Adrian McManus: I would think maybe nine months.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you share similar responsibilities with Blanca Francia?
Adrian McManus: Are you talking about Mr. Jackson's room, or just as a maid, as an aide?
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase it. When you worked at Neverland, what did you understand Blanca Francia's responsibilities to be?
Adrian McManus: Blanca had Mr. Jackson's room. She was his personal maid. Although Blanca did help out with the other things in the house or the guest units. She kind of did a lot of everything.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you worked at Neverland, what did you understand your responsibilities to be?
Adrian McManus: Are you talking about the beginning or --
Mr. Mesereau: Let's start at the beginning, sure.
Adrian McManus: Okay. When I started, I was just a regular maid, like everybody else. I was in the kitchen helping wash dishes. Set tables. I mean, actually a lot of different stuff. You know, cleaning the guest quarters, the theater, everything, except Mr. Jackson's room.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you begin to clean Mr. Jackson's room?
Adrian McManus: Actually, about nine months after my employment, which was when Blanca quit.
Mr. Mesereau: During the first nine months of your employment when Blanca was working there, did you ever go into Mr. Jackson's room?
Adrian McManus: I can't recall.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall ever having similar responsibilities in Mr. Jackson's house to Blanca Francia?
Adrian McManus: At times, yeah, maybe.
Mr. Mesereau: Were there times when she would clean Mr. Jackson's room on a given day, and on another day you would clean Mr. Jackson's room?
Adrian McManus: No. No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So you didn't go near his room for the first nine months you worked there, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: During those nine months, did you and Blanca Francia speak to each other?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you speak to each other often during those first nine months?
Adrian McManus: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn that Blanca Francia had sold a story to a television show?
Adrian McManus: Um, I heard she did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you hear she had sold a story for money to Hard Copy?
Adrian McManus: I heard she did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you and Blanca ever discuss that subject?
Adrian McManus: No.
Mr. Mesereau: How many -- let me rephrase that. You sold the sketch to a tabloid, right?
Adrian McManus: Me personally?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Adrian McManus: Not me personally. Somebody else did.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, they did it on your behalf, right?
Adrian McManus: Well, I would probably think so. I don't -- yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, how did that person get the sketch?
Adrian McManus: Gary Morgan had gone to our attorney's office, Mr. Ring, Michael Ring, and that's where he got it, from there, at the attorney's office.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you bring the sketch to Mr. Ring's law office?
Adrian McManus: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell Mr. Ring, “I took this from Neverland Ranch”?
Adrian McManus: No, I -- actually, I don't even -- I don't even think Michael Ring -- I don't even think he saw it. I don't know if he saw it. I told Gary Morgan that I got it out of the trash. And I told him he could have it. So that's kind of where that went. And I don't know what Gary --
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you didn't really say he could have it, you sold it?
Adrian McManus: Actually, I told him he could have it. And he went and, I guess, sold it. And then I think he said something in the tabloid, I don't even know which one it was, something that I had told him that I got it out of Mr. Jackson's bedroom in the trash or something to that -- which was not correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You're telling the jury that Michael Jackson did a sketch of Elvis Presley and you picked it out of the trash?
Adrian McManus: I found it outside by the rec room in the trash, in the trash. And when I found it there, I thought, well, it was neat, so I took it. It was in the trash.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that one of the items the Santa Maria jury found you had stolen?
Adrian McManus: Well, that's what they --
Mr. Zonen: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: When you went to Mr. Ring, did you tell this attorney where you got the sketch?
Adrian McManus: I don't even recall if I -- he probably heard during the deposition that -- because I think I was questioned about that during the deposition, and I did say that I found it in the trash. But I don't remember -- I don't remember telling him about that myself. It must have been, you know, at the deposition where I said I found it in the trash.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you sell that sketch before you went to trial in your lawsuit against Michael Jackson?
Adrian McManus: Before I went to trial?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Adrian McManus: You know what? I don't even know -- I really don't know when that -- the timing. I don't know if it was during the trial maybe, later during the trial.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me ask you this: You've told the jury the money that came -- excuse me. Let me rephrase it. You've told the jury the money that was obtained in return for that sketch helped fund your lawsuit against Mr. Jackson, right?
Adrian McManus: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you know when you did that that Mr. Jackson was alleging that you had stolen that sketch?
Adrian McManus: Not that I know of.
Mr. Mesereau: Let me ask you if this statement is accurate: You took what you were accused of stealing and sold it for money to fund your lawsuit against Mr. Jackson, right?
Adrian McManus: I took what I found in the trash and gave it to Gary Morgan and he sold it.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point you knew you were accused of stealing that sketch of Elvis Presley, right?
Adrian McManus: I got accused of that, yes.
The Court: All right. Let's end for today.
Adjourn Message: The proceedings adjourned at 2:30 p.m.
