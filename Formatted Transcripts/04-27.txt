Message: HAMID MOSLEHI Having been previously sworn, resumed the stand and testified further as follows:
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION Continued BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Good morning.
Hamid Moslehi: Good morning.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Moslehi, yesterday you mentioned that you had decided to give Janet Arvizo a $2,000 loan on approximately February 19th, 2003, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you said you did that based upon a phone conversation with Ms. Arvizo that lasted about 25 minutes, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't give her the actual check till the next day after you had filmed the Arvizo family in what is often referred to as the rebuttal portion, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Towards the end of it, after the interview, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Now, obviously, if you were filming the Arvizo family in that tape, you heard what Janet was saying, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Oftentimes I wasn't paying fully attention to what she was saying because I was mostly concerned about, you know, lighting, camera, that kind of stuff. But, yeah, I heard some.
Mr. Mesereau: But you heard a number of the things that Janet Arvizo said in that footage, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Some, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you hear her saying words to the effect that her family had been spat upon and abused and not treated properly by various people?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And would it be accurate to say that your phone conversation with her the previous day plus what you heard her say in that tape-recording influenced you to give her $2,000?
Hamid Moslehi: In some effect, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, in your phone conversation with Ms. Arvizo on February 19th, 2003, did she ever tell you that she was living with and being supported by a Major Jay Jackson?
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll object as assumes facts not in evidence. Compound, as well.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll rephrase it if the Court would like.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Mesereau: When Ms. Arvizo on the 19th of February 2003 in your approximately 25-minute phone conversation discussed her financial situation, did she ever tell you she was living with Major Jay Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember her making a comment as far as where she lives and who she lives with.
Mr. Mesereau: In that conversation, did she ever tell you that she was being supported by a Major Jay Jackson?
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll object as assuming facts not in evidence.
Mr. Mesereau: Strictly a question.
The Court: The objection is overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: Um, did she mention whether she lives or being supported by Jay Jackson?
Mr. Mesereau: My first question was, did Janet Arvizo in your phone conversation on February 19th, 2003, ever mention to you that she was living with a Major Jay Jackson, and I believe you said, “No”.
Hamid Moslehi: I believe -- I don't remember having that conversation.
Mr. Mesereau: My next question is, in that same phone conversation did Janet Arvizo ever mention that she was receiving any financial support from a Major Jay Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember having that conversation.
Mr. Mesereau: In that phone conversation, did Ms. Arvizo ever mention that her family had obtained an approximately $152,000 settlement from J.C. Penney?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: In that phone conversation, did Miss Arvizo ever mention that her family had received any money from fund-raisers at The Laugh Factory?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll object and move to strike, as to the last question, as vague as to time.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: In that phone conversation of February 19th, 2003, did Ms. Arvizo ever mention that any celebrities had at any time given her family money?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; vague as to time.
The Court: Overruled.
Hamid Moslehi: Do I answer? No.
Mr. Mesereau: And in your phone conversation on February 19th, 2003, did Ms. Arvizo ever mention that she had set up a bank account for the benefit of her son Gavin from which she withdrew thousands of dollars?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; assumes facts not in evidence.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: In that phone conversation on February 19th, 2003, did Ms. Arvizo ever mention that she had set up a bank account for the benefit of her son Gavin?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And in that same phone conversation, did she ever mention that her family had ever obtained any vehicle from Michael Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did she ever say in that phone conversation any benefits, financial or otherwise, that she or her family had received from Michael Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did she ever say anything about someone named Louise Palanker giving the family $20,000?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did she ever say anything about Fritz Coleman, a newscaster in Los Angeles, trying to raise money for the family?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did she ever say anything about Chris Tucker giving $2,000 to the family?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did she ever say anything about Chris Tucker giving the family the use of a vehicle at any time?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you indicated that when you went to Neverland to pick up the family -- excuse me. Pardon me. Let me rephrase that. Poor question. You indicated that you drove to Neverland for the purpose of filming the family at Neverland, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you indicated that when you got there, to your knowledge, the children were there but Janet Arvizo was not, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And I believe you said you spoke to Joe Marcus about your desire to take the children to Los Angeles to do the filming, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: After Janet not being there, there was a decision made that the interview will take place in L.A.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: And I informed Joe Marcus about that decision.
Mr. Mesereau: And to your knowledge, who was Joe Marcus?
Hamid Moslehi: Joe Marcus is Neverland Valley property manager.
Mr. Mesereau: And had you met him before?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And was it your understanding he had worked at Neverland for a long period of time?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And your understanding from Mr. Marcus was that he didn't have the authorization to let the children get in your car and drive off to Los Angeles, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: What I remember is that I told him about the plan of taking the kids to Los Angeles for an interview, and if I remember correctly, he said that they're not allowed to leave the property.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point, he came back to you and said he had the authority to let you drive the kids to L.A., correct?
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, it just happened that I took the kids and I don't remember having any more conversation. But he was aware of me taking the kids with me.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So did you assume at the time that Mr. Marcus knew the children were on the property, without the mother, and that Mr. Marcus needed some type of authorization to just let them go off with you?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; requires speculation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: How much time elapsed between Mr. Marcus telling you that he didn't have authority to let the kids go and your actually taking the kids with you?
Hamid Moslehi: Approximately 30 minutes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did you assume that within that 30-minute period Mr. Marcus telephoned someone to find out if he could let these children leave the property?
Hamid Moslehi: I assume that's what he did, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you then, approximately 30 minutes later, put the three children in your car and drove them to Los Angeles, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you ever had those three children in your car before?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, when you went to Mr. Marcus and told him you wanted to take the three children to Los Angeles, did he ask you if you had the authority to do so?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you tell him you had the mother's permission to put her three children in your car and drive them to Los Angeles?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But I assume at some point you thought you had the mother's permission to do that, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And at some point in time, you learned that Janet Arvizo did not want to return to Neverland for the filming, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You learned that Janet Arvizo wanted the filming to take place somewhere in Los Angeles County, correct?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; assumes facts.
The Court: I'll sustain the objection as vague.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: At some point before you put the three children into your automobile and drove them to your home, was it your understanding that the mother approved your doing that?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And I gather you then drove the children directly to your home; is that right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: When you got to your home, was Janet Arvizo there?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: At some point after you arrived at your home with the three children, did Janet Arvizo arrive?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And as you testified, the filming then took place at your home, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you indicated that an investigator named Brad Miller was there, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you learn that he was working for Attorney Mark Geragos?
Hamid Moslehi: I did not know who he was working for.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you assume he was investigating somebody?
Hamid Moslehi: I didn't know why he's there.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did he ever explain to you why he was there?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But he must have identified himself as a private investigator, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No. What happened is I asked one of the gentlemen of Marc Schaffel's people who this guy is, and they said he's a private investigator.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you never really knew if he was investigating the Arvizos, or Schaffel, or you, or anybody, right?
Hamid Moslehi: I didn't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you've been interviewed by representatives of the District Attorney's Office, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And have they ever discussed with you who Mr. Miller is in those interviews?
Hamid Moslehi: On November 18, 2003, I was served with a search warrant. On that search warrant, it says that any document that could show any relationship between me and Brad Miller.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: And there were some other questions about that.
Mr. Mesereau: And other than him being at your house that night, you really had no relationship with him, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And if he was putting anyone under surveillance, you weren't aware of it, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And at some time you learned that he had actually done a few minutes of surveillance on you, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Recently I learned that.
Mr. Mesereau: You learned that from the prosecution, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, obviously yesterday, the prosecutor played that little bit of footage, and you identified yourself and your automobile, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And where did that footage take place, if you know?
Hamid Moslehi: That's what I was wondering yesterday. I don't --
Mr. Mesereau: It was not at your home, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: It was somewhere else?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: It appeared that you were going to a parked vehicle that you owned?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: But you're not sure where that was?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Did you ever see Investigator Brad Miller after that evening you filmed the Arvizo family?
Hamid Moslehi: Did I see him again?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: So that was the first and only time you've ever seen the guy?
Hamid Moslehi: That was the first and the last time I ever saw him.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he ever call you after that and ask you anything, to your knowledge?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But you're saying Marc Schaffel told you he was a private investigator?
Hamid Moslehi: One of his guys.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Not Schaffel himself?
Hamid Moslehi: Not Schaffel himself.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. But whoever told you that didn't tell you that he was employed by Attorney Geragos, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Did you learn that at some point, that Mr. Miller was a private investigator hired by Attorney Mark Geragos?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: I heard on the T.V.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. All right. Let me get back to the financial disagreement you had regarding your filming the Arvizo family, okay?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sorry, repeat that, please.
Mr. Mesereau: The concerns you had about being properly compensated for the work that you had done, okay?
Hamid Moslehi: Unpaid invoices?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. I want to ask you some questions about that. At the time you filmed the Arvizo family for purposes of the rebuttal documentary, did you know when the documentary was supposed to air on television?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And what was your understanding about when that rebuttal documentary with Maury Povich was supposed to air on television?
Hamid Moslehi: February 20th of 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: That didn't give you much time to get the footage you filmed to the network that was going to actually air the show, did it?
Hamid Moslehi: No. In fact, we missed the deadline.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Originally, was the plan for you to film the family, get immediately paid and get it to the network? Was that the initial plan?
Hamid Moslehi: The initial plan was to finish this rebuttal documentary by midnight of 19 -- February 19 of 2003, to be aired for the 20th. And the day after it's aired I was supposed to get paid in full.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And I believe you testified that you withheld the footage because you hadn't been immediately paid, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I held the footage because of other reasons. I had to make a copy of it. And also, since we missed the deadline, there was no reason to rush to deliver these tapes anyway.
Mr. Mesereau: But by withholding the footage, it was clear to you that it could never be on the televised documentary, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Sorry, say that again?
Mr. Mesereau: By withholding the footage the way you did for the reasons you've expressed, it was obvious to you that it could never appear on the documentary, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, as I said, we missed the deadline anyway, so there was no way that those footage could have been used in the rebuttal documentary.
Mr. Mesereau: But your understanding about why you were to film the family was that there was a desire to possibly use that footage in the T.V. documentary, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, originally we were supposed to shoot this on 19, February 19, to be delivered by midnight to the production company. Since we passed that deadline, I knew that it's not going to be used for the rebuttal documentary.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, yesterday, you testified that Dieter and Konitzer had promised you a profit participation in the televised documentary, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: A percentage of the revenue.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, I think yesterday you used the firm -- used the term, excuse me, a percentage of gross profits; was that true?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah, gross profit.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Because there is documentation that talks about your claim that you had a net profits interest as opposed to a gross profits interest?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, maybe I'm not qualified to distinguish the difference between the two, but there was an agreement that once -- once this documentary is aired, there would be a percentage of the sales, amount of the gross sales, to me for my work.
Mr. Mesereau: And was that percentage of gross sales supposed to include gross sales all over the world?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And in your mind, that could be many millions of dollars potentially, right?
Hamid Moslehi: At the time, I didn't know what was the sales.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you're saying that Dieter and Konitzer gave you an oral agreement to that effect, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: There was nothing ever reduced to writing about your having a percentage interest in profits associated with that show, right?
Hamid Moslehi: They promised me that they will put this in writing, but they never did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, in light of the fact that the footage of the Arvizo family could not appear in that documentary, did you still think you were entitled to that percentage interest?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: In light of the fact that the footage could not appear in that documentary, did you still feel you were entitled to your normal fees and costs?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, the Arvizo family footage was not the only one, the only footage to be used in that rebuttal documentary. There was some other footage created by me that was supposed to be used in there.
Mr. Mesereau: And an example of that footage was your own personal interview, right?
Hamid Moslehi: As far as profit goes?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Could you be more specific?
Mr. Mesereau: Sure. Sure. Let's talk about all the work you did on the rebuttal show that was hosted by Maury Povich, okay?
Hamid Moslehi: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: The work you did was a personal interview, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Personal interview of --
Mr. Mesereau: You.
Hamid Moslehi: I did not do that myself.
Mr. Mesereau: But you spoke yesterday about a personal interview --
Hamid Moslehi: No, I did not shoot that interview. In other words, I did not shoot myself to be interviewed. Somebody else shot me.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. But certainly you did grant an interview that somebody else shot for purposes of that documentary, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you also obviously did a shoot of the Arvizo family for the purposes of that documentary, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: What else did you do for the purposes of preparing that documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: As I remember correctly, I put 250 hours in a matter of 11 days, 250 hours in a matter of 11 days, oftentimes 20 -- 20 hours a day to finish this rebuttal documentary.
Mr. Mesereau: And that included footage of other family members of the Jackson family, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: The Jacksons' family members interview, other footage that I provided, and edited for --
Mr. Mesereau: Right.
Hamid Moslehi: -- for the purpose of this documentary.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. Now, other than the Arvizo footage, did you provide the other footage you did to the network?
Hamid Moslehi: Other footage of?
Mr. Mesereau: Family members. Did you provide that in a timely fashion so it could be used in the documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: When you say “family members”, are you talking about Mr. Jackson's family members?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: So that was given in time to be included in the documentary, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: The only footage you did that was not provided in time to include in the documentary was the footage of the Arvizo family, right?
Hamid Moslehi: The only footage that was not provided?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, let me -- I'm probably confusing you. Don't intend to. The Arvizo family footage never got there in time, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: The other footage you did did get there in time, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. If you knew that the footage of the Arvizo family was not going to get there in time, why did you continue to do it?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, since we set up all the equipment and everything, might as well shoot it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And your position after you shot it was, “I want to make a copy of it, and I'm not handing it over to anybody till I'm properly compensated”, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No, first my thought was I'm making a copy of it, just for insurance. In case something happens to the tapes, there's a copy of it. But the morning after when Ronald and Dieter and other of Mr. Jackson's agents refused to talk to me about this unpaid invoices issue, I decided that I'm not going to do anything until I get paid.
Mr. Mesereau: Uh-huh. Okay. Your position was you weren't going to do anything until you got paid your normal fees and costs that were owed, plus you had a documented percentage interest in profits coming from the show, right?
Hamid Moslehi: All the unpaid invoices and the percentage that they promised me.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Okay. Now, your lawyers at Greenberg Traurig, the law firm you retained, wrote a letter to David LeGrand on March 5th, 2003, that I showed you yesterday, okay?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't think you showed me a letter of my lawyer.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, may I -- would it refresh your recollection if I just show it to you?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: No, you haven't asked him a question that requires any refreshing of memory.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall a letter from your lawyers that was written to David LeGrand on March 5th, 2003?
Hamid Moslehi: There was a lot of letters wrote. I don't recall which one you are referring to.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall one written on March 5th, 2003?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember a specific date.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you a copy of that letter?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach?
The Court: No. You haven't asked him a question that requires refreshing of memory.
Mr. Mesereau: I thought -- he doesn't know the date, Your Honor. I was just going to refresh him on that. All right.
Mr. Mesereau: How long after you completed the footage of the Arvizo family did you retain a law firm to represent you?
Hamid Moslehi: Could you repeat that again?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. You filmed the Arvizo family on the 20th, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You withheld the footage - okay? - for various reasons that you've identified?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: And you went to a law firm to represent you shortly after that, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: What do you mean “shortly after”?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, within a couple of weeks, true?
Hamid Moslehi: Approximately.
Mr. Mesereau: The law firm was a firm by the name of Greenberg Traurig, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And Greenberg Traurig wrote a letter to Attorney David LeGrand, who you have spoken about before. They wrote him a letter on March 5th, 2003, identifying your position on compensation, right?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know for sure?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, again, I don't have my records here, so I don't know what -- what letter you're referring to.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Would it refresh your recollection if I show that to you?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: The letter of March 5th, is that permitted, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: So what number?
Hamid Moslehi: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that document?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, my lawyer was in touch with Mr. LeGrand, so most of the communications were between my lawyer and Mr. LeGrand.
Mr. Mesereau: But you've looked at that document I showed you, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Right now I looked at it.
Mr. Mesereau: And you see a date of March 5th, 2003?
Hamid Moslehi: It says March 5th.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know approximately when you hired a lawyer to represent you on this particular issue?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. It was shortly after you filmed the Arvizo family, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: When you say “shortly”, what do you mean?
Mr. Mesereau: Within a couple weeks? Within two weeks?
Hamid Moslehi: Approximately.
Mr. Mesereau: And had you made any verbal requests to Dieter and Konitzer to fulfill what you say their promises were before you went to a lawyer?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sorry, say that again?
Mr. Mesereau: Had you spoken to Dieter and Konitzer between the filming of the Arvizo family and the time you retained the law firm of Greenberg Traurig?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I spoke with them.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you try to get things resolved with them?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And I gather you could not do that?
Hamid Moslehi: Negative.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you were asking to be compensated for projects you had done since 1999, right?
Hamid Moslehi: There were unpaid invoices --
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: -- from .99, 2001, and I believe 2002 and 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: Right. One of them had to do with your filming the Air Force visiting Neverland, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't have my records, but it could be.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you your outstanding -- a record of your outstanding invoice?
Hamid Moslehi: Is that one of the outstanding?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: It is, for sure? Okay. I mean, I don't have my records. I do have records that shows what has been paid, what has not been paid.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: But right now I don't have nothing in front of me to be able to tell you whether that specific invoice has been paid or not.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection if I just show you a record of your invoices?
Hamid Moslehi: Please.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What number, Counsel?
Hamid Moslehi: Are you referring to this one? Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to look at that document?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it refresh your recollection about your outstanding invoices at that time?
Hamid Moslehi: What you showed me, it's a summary of all the unpaid invoices at the time.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And some of the work you had done you had provided and some of it you had withheld pending payment, true?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, the -- you had done an interview with Michael Jackson, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: I did an interview with Michael Jackson?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you, in your invoices, refer to the Bashir interview with Michael Jackson in Florida, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You had filmed that interview yourself, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were withholding that footage until you were paid, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, the schedule your lawyer provided indicated that, didn't it?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, this footage that you're talking about, it's been aired already. So that means I have provided that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall your lawyer saying you were going to withhold that footage until you were paid on March 5th, 2003?
Hamid Moslehi: Do I recall if my lawyer were saying that I'm going to withhold --
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: -- the footage until I get paid?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: That footage was not withheld.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Because it was aired already on February 20th --
Mr. Mesereau: So that --
Hamid Moslehi: -- by FOX.
Mr. Mesereau: So you weren't withholding anything in that regard?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, that footage, no.
Mr. Mesereau: The only footage you say you're withholding is the footage of the Arvizo family?
Hamid Moslehi: Again, I don't have my records, but if you tell me, I'll take your word.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall filming in London, in New York, some footage dealing with Sony?
Hamid Moslehi: I do remember that.
Mr. Mesereau: And were you withholding that footage until you were paid?
Hamid Moslehi: Again, I don't have my records to tell you whether I have turned over those footage or not.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm talking about March 5th, 2003. Do you recall whether your position was you were going to withhold footage dealing with Sony in New York and London until you were paid?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't understand your question.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Let me rephrase it. As of March 5th, 2003 --
Hamid Moslehi: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: -- the Arvizo footage that you have described was not the only footage you were refusing to deliver until you were properly paid, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I mean, I -- can you refresh my memory by making an example of it?
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to look at this summary of invoices your lawyer sent?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach?
The Court: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: When it says, “No”, not necessarily means nothing has been turned over. Maybe not like the original copy, but there has been copies that has been delivered already. In fact, if you look at that summary, you'll see under the Martin Bashir footage, it says, “No”, but it was provided, a copy of that footage anyway.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Because it was aired on February 20th.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall any money ever being wired to you in partial payment of what you felt you were owed for the work you did?
Hamid Moslehi: There was one payment made after -- I believe a month after what they promised me.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know how much that was?
Hamid Moslehi: 200,000.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Who wired you the 200,000; if you know?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe it was from David LeGrand's office.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And do you recall how much you felt you were still owed after you received the 200,000?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe my invoices were over $300,000.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: For a period of a year and a half, which 200,000 was paid.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you, to this day, never turned over the Arvizo footage to anyone, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: The Arvizo footage was seized by sheriffs representatives when they did a search of your home, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, when did you last talk to Janet Arvizo?
Hamid Moslehi: February 20th of 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So that was the last day you saw her or spoke to her, right?
Hamid Moslehi: As I remember, that's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Have you ever spoken to any of her three children since that day?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, the prosecutor asked you questions about Dieter and Konitzer claiming they managed Mr. Jackson's affairs, right?
Hamid Moslehi: I was informed by Mr. Ronald and Dieter, Konitzer and Weizner, that sometime in probably approximately December of 2002, they going to take over the management of Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were instructed by Konitzer not to call Michael Jackson, right?
Hamid Moslehi: At one point, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: He asked you to only call him and not call Michael Jackson or Evvy, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, it's in response to the doors opened by the prosecution on that issue.
The Court: The objection's overruled.
Mr. Mesereau: Approximately when did Konitzer tell you, “Don't speak to Michael Jackson or Evvy”?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe was like approximately February 21st.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Late February, I mean of 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: And did he do that in person or on the phone?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe there was an e-mail and a phone.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And he told you that he was going to clean up the mismanagement in Mr. Jackson's business affairs, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: He told you he was in charge of all restructuring, right?
Hamid Moslehi: They told me that they going to take over, and, you know, make things smoother.
Mr. Mesereau: Right.
Hamid Moslehi: Operation.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you honor his request that you not contact Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: Um, I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember whether or not you ever telephoned Mr. Jackson after Mr. Konitzer told you, “Don't call him; just talk to me”?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe I spoke to Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And do you know when that was?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe it was February 21st of 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: I believe.
Mr. Mesereau: And you think that was after Konitzer told you, “Don't ever call Mr. Jackson; just contact me”?
Hamid Moslehi: Could have been.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you talk to Mr. Konitzer after he made that request?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I believe I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever see him in person after he made that request to you?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know where that was?
Hamid Moslehi: In Santa Monica in a hotel.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, at some point did you learn that Weizner and Konitzer had been fired?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection. Assumes facts; hearsay; foundation.
The Court: Sustained on assumes facts.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn whether or not Ron Konitzer continued to be involved in Mr. Jackson's affairs?
Hamid Moslehi: After --
Mr. Mesereau: The 20th.
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah. That was my belief, that he still continued.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you ever learn from him at any point that he was no longer involved with Mr. Jackson's affairs?
Hamid Moslehi: Not from him.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you learn from someone else?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall a lawsuit in England that was filed by attorneys representing Mr. Jackson over the Bashir documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: I have heard about it, but I've never seen the lawsuit itself.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it true that after Bashir did his footage, you asked him to provide you copies of his footage?
Hamid Moslehi: Repeat that question one more time?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, I'm sorry if it's unclear. Did you ever ask Bashir or any agent of Bashir to provide you copies of Bashir's footage?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did you do that?
Hamid Moslehi: The very first day I met him.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, it was understood that you were going to do your own footage at the same time, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's -- well, the first day.
Mr. Mesereau: But you were also asking Bashir to give you some of his footage, right?
Hamid Moslehi: All his footage.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And did he respond to you?
Hamid Moslehi: He said -- he promised he will.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he ever do that?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ask him verbally or in writing; do you know?
Hamid Moslehi: Verbally.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was face to face?
Hamid Moslehi: That was face to face.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And was that at Neverland?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And was that before any of the filming began?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, he never objected to you doing your filming, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: He wasn't happy, but he had no choice.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How much of Bashir's footage -- excuse me, let me rephrase that. How much of the material that Bashir filmed did you film as well? Did you film everything that he filmed?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. What did you actually film yourself?
Hamid Moslehi: Two interviews and one sightseeing at Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: To your knowledge, what did Bashir film that you didn't film yourself?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, since I was not present at all the sessions that Mr. Bashir did, I really don't know how much he shot.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But other than your request that he give you some of his footage, you didn't participate in any litigation involving Bashir, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Legal litigation?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you knew litigation was going on in England, did you not?
Hamid Moslehi: I have heard from Mr. Jackson's personal assistant that there's going to be a lawsuit against Martin Bashir and Granada T.V. in regard to this documentary.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. During the filming of the Arvizo family at your home, you said you were sort of in and out of the room where the filming was being done?
Hamid Moslehi: While I was setting up, yeah, I was going from garage to the place where the interview was supposed to take place.
Mr. Mesereau: But while the interview was actually conducted, were you present at all times?
Hamid Moslehi: During the filming, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And approximately how long did that filming last, if you know?
Hamid Moslehi: Approximately an hour.
Mr. Mesereau: How long were the children at your house before the filming actually began, approximately?
Hamid Moslehi: Two to three hours.
Mr. Mesereau: And how long was Janet Arvizo at your house before the filming actually began?
Hamid Moslehi: Approximately one hour.
Mr. Mesereau: Who did the questioning during the interview?
Hamid Moslehi: Christian Robinson.
Mr. Mesereau: Had you worked with him before?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How many times had you worked with Christian Robinson before?
Hamid Moslehi: On one project.
Mr. Mesereau: All right. And was it your understanding that he had a list of questions he was going to ask during the interview?
Hamid Moslehi: I saw him having a list of questionnaire, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And was it your understanding that he was asking questions from the questionnaire?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you observed the Arvizo family responding to those questions, true?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Before the filming began, did you see Mr. Robinson meet with any member of the Arvizo family?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sure he did. But I did not observe that.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see him going over the questions with any member of the Arvizo family?
Hamid Moslehi: Could have been.
Mr. Mesereau: You're not sure?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm not sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Typically when you film an interview like this, the person doing the interview has a list of questions, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Most of the time.
Mr. Mesereau: And you've filmed numerous interviews like this in your career, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. During the two to three hours that the Arvizo children were at your home before the interview, you never watched them memorizing anything, did you?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; requires speculation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: Repeat that again.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. During the two to three hours that the Arvizo children were at your home prior to the start of the interview, you never saw them memorizing words, did you?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: In fact, what you saw them doing was mostly playing and having fun, right?
Hamid Moslehi: As I remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Before Janet Arvizo started the interview, you didn't watch her memorizing words, did you?
Hamid Moslehi: No, I didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: You said that Janet was there for about an hour, right --
Hamid Moslehi: Approximately.
Mr. Mesereau: -- before the taping began, okay? And I think you said that she was in a discussion about some type of contract, right?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe there was a release that she had to sign.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And was she talking to someone about that release?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Who was she talking to, if you know?
Hamid Moslehi: I think she was talking to a few people. Vinnie, Christian Robinson, and possibly Paul. There's a gentleman by the name of Paul, I believe it's Hugo or something like that. I don't know his last name, but --
Mr. Mesereau: And did you see a document that you thought was a contract or a release?
Hamid Moslehi: I saw a document, but I never looked at it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did it appear that Janet and these other individuals were discussing the document?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes. They were discussing the document.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you actually hear Janet and these individuals discussing this document?
Hamid Moslehi: Did I hear or see?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Well -- excuse me, let me rephrase. Did you hear what you believed was a discussion between Janet and these individuals about that document?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you see Janet and these individuals discussing that document?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe I saw some.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you ever see Janet on the phone during that period of time?
Hamid Moslehi: Could have been. I'm not sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. At some point, did you watch Janet sign that document?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember seeing her signing it. But it was towards the end of the interview, and I -- my understanding was that she signed it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And correct me if I'm wrong, but did you say something yesterday about there being changes made to the document?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe there was some changes being made to the document.
Mr. Mesereau: And what made you believe that?
Hamid Moslehi: Because Vinnie asked me to use my fax machine so he can fax some documents back and forth I believe with Schaffel.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And why did you think Janet at some point signed the document?
Hamid Moslehi: Because there was no other discussion about it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you see -- but you never saw anybody actually sign it, true?
Hamid Moslehi: I didn't see her sign it.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, did you say at some point Schaffel told you he didn't want the Arvizos to know where he lived?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he tell you he was suspicious of the Arvizos?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did Schaffel ever discuss with you why Investigator Brad Miller was there?
Hamid Moslehi: Schaffel himself?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did anyone else there ever tell you that the investigator was investigating the Arvizo family?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: What did you see Brad Miller doing while the taping went on?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, during the taping I was paying attention to, you know, my work. But before that, he was walking around my house.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did he appear to be taking notes at all, to your knowledge?
Hamid Moslehi: During the filming?
Mr. Mesereau: Let me start again. At some point Miller arrived at your house, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And did he knock on the door?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you answer the door?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: And did he identify who he was at that point?
Hamid Moslehi: I said, “Who are you?” And he said, “I'm for the interview”.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did he say he was a private investigator?
Hamid Moslehi: No, he did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Did he give you his card?
Hamid Moslehi: No, he did not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And why did you let him in?
Hamid Moslehi: Um, because I -- why did I let him in? Um, I thought he was with Marc Schaffel's people, and since they were there already, I thought they were expecting him. Maybe it's delivering something or -- I don't know. But being kind and polite, I let him in.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Okay. So he was there the whole time, as far as you know?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know when he left?
Hamid Moslehi: At the end of the interview.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know if he left with anybody?
Hamid Moslehi: I did not see him leaving with who -- with anybody.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see him recording anything in your house?
Hamid Moslehi: No, I did not see him recording anything.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see him writing anything down?
Hamid Moslehi: I did not. Could have been. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: And did you ever see him photographing anything while he was in your house, to your knowledge?
Hamid Moslehi: Not to my knowledge.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, when Janet -- excuse me. Before Janet Arvizo was filmed, she used your rest room and began to apply her own makeup, right?
Hamid Moslehi: She used my --
Mr. Mesereau: Rest room --
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: -- and applied her own makeup for the filming, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And you never saw anybody coaching Janet on what to say, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: No, I did not.
Mr. Mesereau: You never saw anyone coaching the children on what to say in the interview, right?
Hamid Moslehi: I did not see anything.
Mr. Mesereau: I believe you testified yesterday that, in your opinion, Janet Arvizo had a problem with a draft contract, right?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection to the use of the word “contract”.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, I'll change the -- I'll rephrase it.
Mr. Mesereau: You recall Janet looking at a three-page nondisclosure contract, right?
Hamid Moslehi: I never --
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll make the same objection.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever tell a representative of the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department during an interview that Vinnie brought a three-page nondisclosure contract for Janet to sign?
Mr. Auchincloss: Calls for a legal opinion.
The Court: No, he's asking if he told the sheriff that, so the objection is overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember being so specific about “three-page” or “nondisclosure agreement”. If I had said anything about that, about that document, it would have been a release. I don't remember saying that it was a three-page confidentiality or some sort of title for the document.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection to just show you a police report summary of your interview?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Um, I don't --
Mr. Mesereau: I have to first ask you a question.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to review that document?
Hamid Moslehi: No, I never have, that document.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you had a chance to review the document that I just showed you?
Hamid Moslehi: No, I did not, I never obtained that document that you just showed me.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you just look at that document?
Hamid Moslehi: I looked at that document. I do not remember saying three pages nonconfidentiality contract.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. Now, Vinnie at some point asked you to sign a document, did he not?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And you refused to sign a document presented to you by Vinnie, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know what that document concerned?
Hamid Moslehi: That was a three-page non -- a confidentiality document, which he left it at the house.
Mr. Mesereau: The FOX TV special, “The Footage You Were Never Meant To See”, appeared on February 20th, 2003, on television, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you watch that show?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did some of the footage you had done of the Bashir interview appear on that documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, it did.
Mr. Mesereau: Did your interview, your personal interview, appear in that documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, it did.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your understanding that additional documentaries were going to be made to put Mr. Jackson in a favorable light?
Hamid Moslehi: Another after “The Footage You Were Never Meant To See”, I had no knowledge of that.
Mr. Mesereau: You never understood there was to be a two- or three-part series in that regard?
Hamid Moslehi: No. Nobody informed me anything on that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall being at Neverland on approximately February 8th, 2003, to meet people from 60 Minutes?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so. I think it was a Saturday, if I'm not wrong.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember meeting someone named Ed Bradley at Neverland?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you remember meeting Mr. LeGrand on that day?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember meeting other people from CBS on that day?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And why were you at Neverland on February 8th, 2003?
Hamid Moslehi: I was there as a personal DP, which stands for Director of Photography, for Mr. Jackson, for his lighting and the look of his picture.
Mr. Mesereau: Was anything filmed on February 8th, 2003?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know why?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. How long were you there that day, if you remember?
Hamid Moslehi: A few hours.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember seeing Janet Arvizo there that day?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Would it refresh your recollection just to look at the police report summary of your interview?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember making that statement about Janet.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you think you have seen Janet Arvizo at Neverland?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say two or three times.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know approximately when?
Hamid Moslehi: At various times.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Approximately when do you think the first time you saw Janet Arvizo at Neverland was?
Hamid Moslehi: Between 2000 and 2003. It could have been 2001. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you meet her for the first time when the 60 Minutes crew was at Neverland?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember seeing her that day.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. When do you think you first saw her, ever?
Hamid Moslehi: It could have -- again, it's between the year 2000 and 2002, I would say. It could -- like approximately 2001. I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: And was your first meeting with her at Neverland, to your knowledge?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And do you recall whether or not her children were there when you met her the first time?
Hamid Moslehi: I think they were.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you indicated in response to the prosecutor's questions you developed a friendship with the Arvizo family?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, as I said, in the year 2000, I did two projects that Arvizo kids, David or Star and Gavin, were involved. One of the project I was directing. And within that project I had a lot of conversations and interactions with David and Gavin. So I kind of got to know them.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you stay in touch with them on a social level?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: When you weren't talking to them at Neverland, did you call them on the phone?
Hamid Moslehi: From Neverland, calling them?
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase it. I'll ask a better question. Aside from the instances where you saw them in person, did you have a relationship where you would call them from time to time?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Did they call you from time to time?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So your only involvement with them was either at Neverland or when they came to your home; is that right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't see them during your trips to Florida, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No, I didn't.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you indicated that you had met one of Marlon Brando's sons; is that correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And who did you meet that was a son of Marlon Brando?
Hamid Moslehi: Miko Brando.
Mr. Mesereau: And when did you first meet him?
Hamid Moslehi: .97, .98.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see him often at Neverland?
Hamid Moslehi: Sometimes.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it your understanding that he was a friend of Michael Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: Friend and associate.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And when did you last see him?
Hamid Moslehi: Last time, end of February of 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you did an interview with a woman named Debbie Rowe, didn't you?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was footage that you filmed for purposes of the rebuttal documentary, right?
Hamid Moslehi: At the time I don't think there was a rebuttal documentary. My understanding was she was responding to some of the comments that Bashir made on his documentary.
Mr. Mesereau: And that interview took place at your home, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did that take place?
Hamid Moslehi: At Marc Schaffel's house in Calabasas.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, okay. Okay. Do you know approximately when that interview took place?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe early February 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: So it took place before you filmed the Arvizo family, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you meet Ms. Rowe at Marc Schaffel's house?
Hamid Moslehi: I met her at -- well, not for the first time, but, yeah, I saw her.
Mr. Mesereau: But when you filmed her for purposes of responding to the Bashir documentary, you traveled to Schaffel's home, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And when you got there, was Debbie Rowe present?
Hamid Moslehi: Or she came afterwards.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't bring her there, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: So your understanding on February 20th was that Schaffel had no problem with Debbie Rowe knowing where he lived, but he didn't want the Arvizos to know where he lived, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That could be so, yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: But he never told you why he didn't want the Arvizos to know where his house was?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, it was no secret that the purpose of the rebuttal documentary was to put Mr. Jackson in a positive light, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Everyone knew that was the purpose, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: It was meant to be a response to the Bashir documentary, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: It was meant to show things that Bashir had left out of his documentary that were positive about Michael, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You actually had volunteered to provide footage that Bashir had left out of his show, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Did I volunteer?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. It was partly your idea to include your footage in the response to Bashir, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Um --
Mr. Mesereau: Let me rephrase it if it's unclear.
Hamid Moslehi: Please.
Mr. Mesereau: At some point following the airing of Bashir, you came forward and said, “I have footage of what positive things Bashir said about Michael”, right?
Hamid Moslehi: This, I believe, was prior to the airing it. Prior to the airing the ABC version of Martin Bashir in the United States.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Okay. Let me restate the question. You saw the Bashir documentary at some point, right?
Hamid Moslehi: At one point, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When you saw it, you realized he had left out a lot of footage where he praises Michael Jackson, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, he had footage where he praised Michael Jackson for being a good parent, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I mean, let me correct --
Mr. Mesereau: Sure.
Hamid Moslehi: Okay. The timing of how you're putting it is kind of off.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, okay.
Hamid Moslehi: I was told by Mr. Jackson's personal assistant at one point, before this documentary, the ABC version of the Martin Bashir was aired in United States; that Martin Bashir is going to air his own version in London through BBC, I believe. At that point I brought up the fact that I have some footage of the behind the scenes. So at that time I have not seen the Martin Bashir footage yet.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Am I clear?
Mr. Mesereau: At that particular time, you were the only one that had a copy of your footage, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did you talk to representatives of FOX about including your footage in the FOX documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Who did you talk to about including your footage in that show?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, this is how it happened: I talked to Mr. -- Miss Evvy Tavasci, which is Mr. Jackson's personal assistant. I informed her that I have footage of the behind-the-scene and other footage of the interview.
Mr. Mesereau: Uh-huh.
Hamid Moslehi: And I offered her to look at it. And she refused. She said, “It's okay. Don't worry. Mr. Jackson has obtained lawyers and they're going to take care of this matter”. I took the footage with a video camera and a play-back machine to the office of Miss Tavasci to show her what I have. She still refused to look at them, and she indicated that I should not be worried about it, and Mr. Jackson's lawyers will handle the situation. Then --
Mr. Mesereau: And what did you do next?
Hamid Moslehi: Next, I believe I spoke to Mr. Jackson and he asked me to call Dieter --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: -- about the matter.
Mr. Mesereau: Right.
Hamid Moslehi: I spoke to Dieter, and I told him what I have, and he informed me that I'm going to go to Florida for another type of filming, and we're going to discuss this matter with him.
Mr. Mesereau: And it was after that that you flew to Florida, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you flew to Florida expecting to do some filming, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point in Florida you learned that there was a change of plans and there would be no filming; is that correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: How long were you in Florida for that trip?
Hamid Moslehi: I think a day, one day maybe.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately when that was?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't have my records here. But I believe it's like February 6th and 7th. Something like that.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember hearing anything about a press conference that was cancelled in Florida?
Hamid Moslehi: Did I hear that there was a press conference that was cancelled?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall any talk about a press conference in Florida?
Hamid Moslehi: I asked what is the purpose of this filming --
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: -- and they never give me a specific answer. But my understanding was that it could have been either a press conference or a response in a video format from Mr. Jackson to Martin Bashir documentary.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, how long after you got to Florida did you find out there was a change of plans and you were not going to be filming anything?
Hamid Moslehi: I think hours after that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you spend the night in Florida on that trip?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did you stay?
Hamid Moslehi: At the hotel.
Mr. Mesereau: The Turnberry?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember the name of the hotel.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And did you fly back on your own the next day?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And when you were in Florida for that trip, did you see Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see any of the Arvizos?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see Chris Tucker?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see Dieter or Konitzer?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And where did you see them?
Hamid Moslehi: In their room.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
The Court: Okay, Counsel. Let's take a break.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Counsel?
Mr. Sanger: Yes, Your Honor, if I may address the Court.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you. We would -- first of all, it's a good time to do this on the record. There were four DVDs which were lodged with the Court on a previous occasion for a pre-trial matter that were numbered 913, 1011 and 12, and also 1315, and I don't think they were given exhibit numbers at the time. I believe the Court has allowed the clerk to now mark the Exhibits 913, 1011 and 12 as 5009-A, -B, and -C. And then the item marked 1315 has been marked as 5010. So we'd just like the record to reflect that, if we can, Your Honor, first of all.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sanger: Now, having said that, we would like -- as a part of the cross-examination of this witness, we would like to play Exhibit 5009-A, -B and -C, which are the outtakes or Mr. Moslehi's footage of the Bashir interviews. And they're offered for the purpose of showing the context and the complete statements made by Mr. Jackson at the time that certain statements were edited out and placed in the Bashir video. And as the Court recalls, statements in the Bashir video were admitted for the truth of the matter as admissions of the party. And these videos show the context in which those statements were made, not just the particular words, but the whole context in which Mr. Jackson was led to make those statements. So that's our offer. Now, I've talked to the District Attorney, Mr. Auchincloss. I asked him if he would agree that we could play this in open court without first showing Mr. Moslehi to authenticate it, and he is considering that; I think probably will agree to that. The question that he asked that we address right now was the admissibility of this, so I asked the bailiff to ask Your Honor to come out so we could talk about --
The Court: I already ruled that it wasn't admissible in the direct part of the People's case, because the Bashir case -- the Bashir tape was introduced for the limited purpose of showing that Mr. Jackson had some motive to be doing certain acts that the People claimed that he did, and it had nothing to do with the truth of the matter in the tape, although the tape was admitted under certain circumstances for the truth of the matter. So your request is denied. That's the second time I've denied it. All right. Let's bring in the jury.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, could I --
The Court: No.
Mr. Sanger: I don't mean to argue -- okay.
Message: The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence and hearing of the jury:
The Court: You may proceed.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Moslehi, I believe you testified that you had approximately six or seven meetings with the Arvizo family at various times. Does that sound right?
Hamid Moslehi: Approximately.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And I believe you testified that Janet Arvizo told you in the phone conversation of the 19th of February, 2003, that she was being hassled by the media; is that right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And she was not happy about that, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And in your interviews with representatives of the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department, you have discussed your various discussions with Janet, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Could you refresh my memory?
Mr. Mesereau: Sure. Sure. Maybe I'm not being clear. In your interviews with representatives of the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department, you have discussed conversations you had with the Arvizos, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Janet and the kids?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And in your discussions with representatives of the prosecution, you have discussed conversations you had with the Arvizos, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Mesereau: At no time did Janet Arvizo tell you she thought she was going to be murdered, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: She never said that to you, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: At no time did Janet Arvizo tell you there were death threats on she and her family, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: At no time did Janet Arvizo tell you she or her family were being falsely imprisoned, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: At no time did Janet Arvizo ever complain to you that Mr. Jackson was giving alcohol to her children, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: At no time did Janet Arvizo ever complain to you that Mr. Jackson was improperly touching any of her children, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: At no time did Janet Arvizo tell you her children were being abused by Mr. Jackson, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: At no time did Janet Arvizo ask you to call the police on her behalf, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you testified that at Mr. Jackson's request, you did a video at Neverland called “Neverland Channel”, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And was it your understanding that was supposed to be a videotape featuring Star Arvizo as sort of the narrator?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, initially my understanding was that we're going to do a pilot - a pilot is like a sample of an idea in a video format - of an idea that Mr. Jackson have.
Mr. Mesereau: And you did film that entire video, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And the understanding was that Mr. Jackson would pay for your services in filming that video, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You also testified that you did a video of Mr. Jackson with Gavin, right?
Hamid Moslehi: The 2000?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And it was your understanding Gavin was recovering from cancer, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, Gavin had cancer. I'm not sure whether he was recovering or not, but --
Mr. Mesereau: But your understanding is he was ill?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And your understanding was that Mr. Jackson also agreed to pay for your services in doing that video, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Customary, sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. At no time was it ever your belief that the Arvizos were supposed to pay for any of these videos?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you currently have a lawsuit against Mr. Jackson, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Unpaid invoices, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Right. You're seeking unpaid invoices and some other benefits, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Like?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you're asking that invoices be paid. You're also --
Hamid Moslehi: Damages.
Mr. Mesereau: Yeah. You're also talking about a profits interest that you claim Dieter and Konitzer promised you, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, in your lawsuit, you're also asking for damages related to a -- excuse me. You're also seeking damages related to some footage of what you call “Michael Jackson's Private Home Videos”, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And that was another FOX special that was done about Michael Jackson, right?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: And it's your belief that some of your work appeared in that show as well, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And it's your belief that you should be paid for your services in that regard, right?
Hamid Moslehi: For -- sure.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Was it your belief that footage you did was going to appear both in the Povich documentary and in another show done by FOX called “Michael Jackson's Home Videos”?
Hamid Moslehi: No. I was never been informed that there is a second documentary.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know, as you sit here today, whether or not there was a second documentary?
Hamid Moslehi: I did not know there was a second documentary. Meaning nobody informed me that there's a follow-up, .nother piece of documentary called “Michael Jackson's Home Videos”.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you learn at some point that that had happened?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: When did you learn that there had been a second documentary called “Michael Jackson's Private Home Videos”?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe I've learned that watching T.V., been advertised.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that show appeared in approximately April of 2003, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Approximately.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you watch that show on television?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Your belief is you're entitled to a profit participation in whatever revenues were generated from that show as well, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I guess we have to talk to my lawyer in regard to that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: Because that's a technical question. I'm not a lawyer to make that kind of --
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But your lawsuit is currently active, right?
Hamid Moslehi: It is.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And your claim is that the agreements you had about being compensated for your services and having a profit participation in these television shows were primarily based on what Dieter and Konitzer told you, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, the invoices, it's part of customary transactions between me and MJJ Productions.
Mr. Mesereau: Right.
Hamid Moslehi: But the percentage was between Ronald, Dieter and me.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you don't know whether Dieter or Konitzer ever discussed a profit participation with Michael Jackson, right?
Hamid Moslehi: With Mr. Jackson himself?
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: I'm not sure.
Mr. Mesereau: They just told you talk to them and don't talk to Mr. Jackson, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, I believe you said that approximately February 21st, 2003, Michael Jackson called you to thank you, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, obviously when he called you to thank you, he hadn't seen what you had filmed, right?
Hamid Moslehi: Filmed what?
Mr. Mesereau: Well, the footage you did of the Arvizos, he could not have seen, true?
Hamid Moslehi: Oh, of the Arvizo family footage.
Mr. Mesereau: But nevertheless, he called you and thanked you for what you had done, right?
Hamid Moslehi: After seeing “The Footage You Were Never Meant To See”, I believe that's why Mr. Jackson called me, to thank me.
Mr. Mesereau: He was talking about the Bashir footage that you had done; is that correct?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; requires speculation.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll rephrase it.
Mr. Mesereau: When Mr. Jackson called you to thank you on February 21st, was it your understanding that he was thanking you about what you had done in the Bashir interview?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; speculation.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: My understanding for that thank-you call was that Mr. Jackson saw the rebuttal documentary, the entire “Footage You Were Never Meant To See”, and because of what I've done --
Mr. Mesereau: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: -- he's calling to thank me.
Mr. Mesereau: But he obviously, at that point, had never seen your film of the Arvizo family, right?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Because you had control of that, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You had never released that, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And he was thanking you for what was on that Maury Povich documentary, true?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions, Your Honor.
The Court: Counsel?
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you, Your Honor.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. AUCHINCLOSS:
Mr. Auchincloss: During the period of time that you were working with the Arvizos on this rebuttal film, you've told us about Christian Robinson, Brad Miller, Paul being present, Vinnie being present, you and your crew. As far as you know, was anybody else involved in this rebuttal video?
Hamid Moslehi: Being involved or being present at my house?
Mr. Auchincloss: That's a good question. Let's add a few names. You mentioned that Frank was involved in it; is that correct?
Hamid Moslehi: He was involved with it, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And Mr. Schaffel was involved in it?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And Mr. Konitzer was involved in it?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm -- sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: He talked to you about it, right?
Hamid Moslehi: I think most of the conversation was going through Dieter than Ronald in regard to that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was Ronald present in that conversation?
Hamid Moslehi: It was a phone conversation, so I don't know whether Ronald was listening to that or not, or whether they had conversation within themselves.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. But you also mentioned a conversation you had in Florida with Ronald and Dieter?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did they discuss filming the rebuttal film at that time?
Hamid Moslehi: At that time, the discussion was about what I had already filmed of Martin Bashir.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: There was nothing on the table as far as project goes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So as far as the project goes, they just told you to talk to Mr. Schaffel?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; assumes facts not in evidence.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll strike the question.
Mr. Auchincloss: So as far as the project goes, what did they direct you to do?
Hamid Moslehi: Once we discussed what I have as far as the footage that I shot of Martin Bashir interview with Mr. Jackson, and once we agreed to certain terms, they informed me and advised me to go to L.A. and talk to Marc Schaffel.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And the purpose of this, you've testified, was to make Michael Jackson look good ultimately, the whole rebuttal film?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So other than the names I've mentioned, were -- were there any other people involved in this enterprise of making the entire rebuttal film, as far as you know?
Hamid Moslehi: Um -- okay, can we go through those names one more time? Just so I don't misunderstand.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Mr. Jackson, Ronald, Dieter. We've got Mr. Schaffel, Frank, Vinnie, Christian, Paul --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection to the question. I don't think it's -- I think it's a compound question.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm asking him for other names.
The Court: He's clarifying an earlier question. Overruled. Go ahead.
Mr. Auchincloss: Paul. Brad Miller. You and your crew.
Hamid Moslehi: Well, there was another production company called Brad Lachman Productions --
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: -- which FOX hired to put the final editing together.
Mr. Auchincloss: Very good. Anybody else other than that?
Hamid Moslehi: Not that I remember right now.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you were engaging in the production or the putting together the various videos that were going to make up this rebuttal film, what were the issues that you were trying to address specifically?
Hamid Moslehi: Comments that Martin Bashir made on his own documentary.
Mr. Auchincloss: Were there comments that Mr. Jackson himself made that you were attempting to address?
Hamid Moslehi: On the Martin Bashir documentary?
Mr. Auchincloss: In your rebuttal, yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Well, we tried to clarify certain statements that Mr. Jackson made which, for example, if Martin Bashir would have continued rolling, I mean, or editing that -- let me try this again.
Mr. Auchincloss: Sure.
Hamid Moslehi: There were certain statements that were made by Mr. Jackson in the Martin Bashir documentary --
Mr. Auchincloss: Uh-huh.
Hamid Moslehi: -- that the way it was edited, what happened is Mr. Jackson sounded different than if they would have continued another two or three seconds of that statement.
Mr. Auchincloss: Give me an example.
Hamid Moslehi: Um -- um --
The Court: Counsel, I have to ask a question. Why are you going into an area that I told the defense they couldn't go into? My objection's sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Thank you, Your Honor. I'll move on.
Mr. Auchincloss: What was the level -- well, let me ask you this: Was there any sense of urgency in the creation of this rebuttal film?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: We tried to get it as soon as possible.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And why was that?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: All right. I'll sustain the foundation objection.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know why there was a sense of urgency in creating this film?
Hamid Moslehi: My opinion? Or was there any discussion from any party?
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you discuss the timing issues of this film with any of the people that I've mentioned previously that were involved in it?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, once this project was sold to FOX, they set up a date, deadline to be aired.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: So basically, based on that date, we'll try to squeeze everything in there and finish it.
Mr. Auchincloss: And that date was?
Hamid Moslehi: February 20th.
Mr. Auchincloss: Midnight February 20th; is that right?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, the deadline to provide the footages was I believe the 19th, February 19 of 2003, to be aired on February 20th, 2003.
Mr. Auchincloss: In terms of the Martin Bashir special, was there any editing done by Mr. Bashir that was problematic, that you saw, that misrepresented Mr. Jackson's statements about him sleeping with children?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; leading; Court order.
The Court: The objection is sustained. It's the area I told you not to go into.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was that area one of the areas that you felt you needed to work on?
Mr. Mesereau: Same objection.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: As far as the -- I want to talk now about the activities that occurred at your home when the Arvizos were being filmed. You mentioned that Janet was -- expressed some reluctance to sign this release; is that correct?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; misstates the evidence.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Janet express any reluctance to sign this release?
Hamid Moslehi: What I saw is that there was a con -- a conversation and a discussion between Janet and Vinnie and other parties about this release or document that was presented to her.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did that discussion cause any delay in the shooting of the filming?
Hamid Moslehi: A little bit. A little bit.
Mr. Auchincloss: How many minutes of delay, would you say, if you can characterize it?
Hamid Moslehi: I would say 15 minutes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you said that Vinnie used your phone number?
Hamid Moslehi: My fax.
Mr. Auchincloss: Your fax number.
Hamid Moslehi: Or they could have used my phone, too.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if he used your phone number?
Hamid Moslehi: To call somebody?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: I remember my phone being used, but I didn't know who's calling who or what. But I remember my phone being used.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know the number (310) 283-5866?
Hamid Moslehi: That's my cell phone number.
Mr. Auchincloss: That's your cell phone number, okay. As far as the use of your fax machine, do you know if Vinnie made any documents that came from your fax machine?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe that he either received or send some faxes through my machine.
Mr. Auchincloss: When Janet had finished with negotiating or talking with Vinnie, Christian and Paul, you mentioned that Vinnie, Christian and Paul seemed happy previously, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: It seemed to me that the matter has been resolved, but --
Mr. Auchincloss: Did Janet seem happy, or could you tell? You tell me.
Hamid Moslehi: Well, when we started filming, she appeared happy. But I don't know, prior to, whether or not she was happy or not. I don't know.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there a change in her demeanor from before filming to when the cameras started rolling?
Hamid Moslehi: Repeat that one more time.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there a change in her demeanor from before the cameras were rolling and she's in your home for this however -- I guess you said it was over an hour -- to the time the cameras started rolling, was there a change in Janet's demeanor?
Hamid Moslehi: She seemed more energetic when the cameras are rolling.
Mr. Auchincloss: You were asked if you saw any coaching, and you said, “No”.
Hamid Moslehi: Not that I remember seeing any coaching.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if she was coached?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't know that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know whether or not -- did you keep your eye on her the entire time that she was in your house?
Hamid Moslehi: The entire house? No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there an opportunity for her to be coached?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; calls for speculation.
The Court: Calls for a conclusion. Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: You mentioned that you went to Neverland at one time for the filming of 60 Minutes, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And was that cancelled?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know why?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't.
Mr. Auchincloss: As far as the entire documentary, this rebuttal documentary, you mentioned that you were to receive some points?
Hamid Moslehi: Percentage.
Mr. Auchincloss: A percentage?
Hamid Moslehi: Yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you spoke to Ronald and Dieter, was it contemplated that this documentary was a for-profit enterprise?
Hamid Moslehi: For profit?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yeah, would make money.
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if it made money?
Hamid Moslehi: I think it did, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know how much it made?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know how much -- was there any discussion about how much this documentary was anticipated to make with Dieter and Ronald?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, FOX --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have a discussion with Dieter and Ronald about the profitability or the amount of money that this documentary or rebuttal could make?
Hamid Moslehi: Did I have any conversations with them that this documentary will make -- well, we knew there was going to be some money made off of it.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: But we didn't know how much at the time.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you have an idea?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation and Court order.
Mr. Auchincloss: It's a “yes” or “no”. That's fine, Your Honor. I'll move on.
Mr. Auchincloss: Now, as far as the -- the Arvizos being taken off -- the Arvizo children being taken off of Neverland, you answered a few questions for counsel concerning that issue when you took the children off Neverland. And you said there was a period of time, I believe it was about a half an hour, between when you first talked to Joe Marcus and he said the children were not allowed off the property and the time when you actually left; is that right?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe so, yeah.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you see where he went during that half hour at all?
Hamid Moslehi: No, I didn't.
Mr. Auchincloss: If you wanted to contact Mr. Jackson when he was away from Neverland, how would you do it?
Hamid Moslehi: I would either call his bodyguards or his office.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Why would you call his bodyguard?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, that's the fastest way to get to Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Auchincloss: Does Mr. Jackson carry a cell phone?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't believe so.
Mr. Auchincloss: Do his bodyguards carry cell phones?
Hamid Moslehi: I think they do.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you seen this?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: If he wants to make a call, do you know what he does in terms of use of a cell phone?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you seen Mr. Jackson ever use a cell phone?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; calls for speculation; beyond the scope.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you seen Mr. Jackson ever use a cell phone over the years you've known him?
Hamid Moslehi: Dialing it, or just talking on it?
Mr. Auchincloss: Talking on it.
Hamid Moslehi: I've seen him talking on the cell phone.
Mr. Auchincloss: Whose cell phone would he use?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm assuming his bodyguards', but I can be wrong.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So after this half hour passed and you left the property, did Joe Marcus offer any resistance?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did he seem to be okay with you taking the children off property?
Hamid Moslehi: Sure.
Mr. Auchincloss: You said that you had a conversation at Neverland with Mrs. Arvizo, and your sense was that she approved of you taking the children to your home. I believe that was your testimony. You correct me if I'm wrong. Is that accurate?
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, after I had a conversation with her, my understanding was that she's going to participate in this rebuttal documentary, but she's not going to be at Neverland, so therefore we went to L.A.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So that was on the evening of February 19th?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And your deadline was midnight on February 19th; is that correct?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was an arrangement made with Brad Lachman Productions that if you got the Arvizo film to them by midnight, they would still be able to incorporate it into the final production of the rebuttal film?
Hamid Moslehi: If I remember correctly, if we had any additional or new footage that we wanted to put into this documentary, should be delivered no longer than midnight 19 -- February 19.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. If you delivered it on February 19th before midnight, was it your understanding there was still time to get it into the final version?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: And your testimony is that you didn't make that deadline?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, we missed that.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you originally talked with Dieter and Ronald about being paid the money that you were owed, was it understood that upon the completion of the Arvizo film, you would be paid, the filming of the Arvizos?
Hamid Moslehi: Upon airing “The Footage You Were Never Meant To See”.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And the Arvizo footage was just part of that?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Did you anticipate that you would be getting a payday - in other words, a payment of all the money that was owed to you - after the 20th of February?
Hamid Moslehi: I was expecting the 21st, by midday, I would receive my payments in full, plus what they promised me.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Are you aware of whether or not this documentary was also sold all over the world?
Hamid Moslehi: It is sold all over the world.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. This rebuttal film was sold all over the world?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: In terms of the filming of the Arvizos, the footage that you obtained, is this footage -- was this footage at the time, did you consider it to be valuable?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; vague.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: At the time that this footage was filmed, you understood that it was not going to make it into the Brad Lachman production, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I was hoping that I can get it done by midnight.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay.
Hamid Moslehi: But once we passed the deadline, I figured it's not going to happen.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you shot it anyway because of what?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, because I was told to, and also I wanted to do my job. I mean, I had a responsibility and I wanted to do that.
Mr. Auchincloss: And who specifically told you to shoot that footage?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe it was arranged through Marc Schaffel and Dieter, those people.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you discuss with anybody the fact that you weren't going to make the deadline and that you should go ahead and shoot it anyway?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember discussing the deadline with anyone. This was just in my mind.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So that was your decision to go ahead and shoot it anyway?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, I figured since I had my crew and equipment ready, if they are happy to participate, get it done at least.
Mr. Auchincloss: Was there a discussion at the shooting about the deadline; that it had to be done by midnight?
Hamid Moslehi: I think I mentioned to one of these guys that, “Guys, we're not going to make it anyway”. But --
Mr. Auchincloss: Do you know if either Christian or Paul or Vinnie knew about the deadline?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm not sure about Vinnie, but I'm sure Christian and Paul should have known about the deadline.
Mr. Auchincloss: And I believe your testimony is that Christian wanted the video to take with him?
Hamid Moslehi: They wanted to take the tapes that night, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Even though it was too late to put it on the --
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. If you -- are you familiar with the value of footages such as this, you know, footage concerning a family that is of public interest on the open market?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Vague; Court order.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm unfamiliar with the Court order, but --
The Court: I'll sustain the objection. It's the restrictions I've placed on financial information.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Mr. Auchincloss: You testified that you gave Janet Arvizo $2,000, considered it a loan, and were asked a number of questions about financial conditions involving Janet Arvizo. Would it have made any difference to you in giving Janet Arvizo this $2,000 if you learned that some people gave her some money three years earlier based upon Gavin's illness? Would that have made any difference to you?
Mr. Mesereau: Calls for speculation and misstates the evidence.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: Um, can you repeat the question one more time?
Mr. Auchincloss: My question is, you gave her this $2,000.
Hamid Moslehi: Okay.
Mr. Auchincloss: You previously stated you were concerned about Janet. Her world was upside down is what you've said. Would it have made any difference, would it have prevented you from doing this act of generosity or kindness if you knew that years earlier she had received some money for charitable -- from charitable individuals to help Gavin? Would that have made any difference?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe, depending on the timing and the amount of money, it could have been.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. So let's say she got $20,000 to help Gavin with his illness in terms of creating a safe room for him, that type of thing.
Hamid Moslehi: Three years prior?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yeah. Would that have made any difference to you?
Hamid Moslehi: For 20,000 three years prior, no.
Mr. Auchincloss: And what about if she got a civil judgment for about 30,000 three years prior, would that have made any difference?
Hamid Moslehi: Three years --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; misstates the evidence.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: Three years, 30,000, no.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. You were asked if she told you some things about her circumstances at the time. Did Janet confide in you anything other than the fact that her world was upside down at that time?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you have a relationship with Janet where she would sit down and confide with you details about her problems, other than what you've stated?
Hamid Moslehi: Did I have a relationship? Such as --
Mr. Auchincloss: Is she the type of person that would sit down and confide in you personal things?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe because I worked with her kids a lot during a few other productions, she kind of felt comfortable to just empty herself of whatever she had in mind, I guess, at that time.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did she do that in that phone conversation with you at Neverland?
Hamid Moslehi: Did she did that on that conversation?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yeah. That you had when you were at Neverland.
Hamid Moslehi: I believe the way she was expressing her, you know, personal life matters, in this case being upside down because of the media, I felt like, you know, she needs a shoulder to cry, kind of things.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did she do that any other time?
Hamid Moslehi: No.
Mr. Auchincloss: When you were -- well, I want to go through this time period of February 20th to the 21st. And I want to talk particularly about your conversation with Mr. Jackson on that. First of all, when you talked to Mr. Jackson after the filming -- or after the airing of the rebuttal film, you mentioned that you talked to him about some financial problems that you were having with him and his production company.
Hamid Moslehi: I believe what I discussed with him is that my invoices are not being paid.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: And also some other issues.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you talk to him about the fact that you were also promised some -- a percentage of the rebuttal film?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't think I went that far. But I just wanted to keep it simple and, you know, short with him, just so, you know, whomever he needs to call, please call, because I'm not being paid.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you explain that you hadn't been paid in years, or over a year, I guess it was?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm not sure whether I mentioned the period of time that I'm not getting paid, but I said that my invoices are not being paid, and I --
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you mention the amount of money that was owed to you?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't remember.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. And what did he tell you to do about these problems?
Hamid Moslehi: He asked me to call David LeGrand, his lawyer.
Mr. Auchincloss: And did you call David LeGrand?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: And you told him about the problems?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, he knew the problem. I told him that, “Mr. Jackson wants to talk to you, so why don't you call Mr. Jackson”.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Did you mention to him that it was about finances?
Hamid Moslehi: I -- well, I don't remember specifically on that conversation whether I spoke or not. But during the day, during the whole entire day, I'd been calling them and asking, you know, “What is it with my payment?” So they were well aware of that I'm not being paid, that they have not made the payment.
Mr. Auchincloss: Sometime later in the day, did you receive a fax from David LeGrand that same day?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe it was the 21st, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: If I may approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Is that a marked exhibit?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes, it is.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Moslehi, I show you Exhibit No. 851. Appears to be a two-page document with a fax page on the first, and the top being -- at the top of each page are the words “Hale Lane”. Do you recognize that document?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I do.
Mr. Auchincloss: What is it, please?
Hamid Moslehi: This is a letter from David LeGrand dated February 21st, 2003. It was faxed to me. And is telling me that my services are no longer required. And then also Mr. Weizner and --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. I'll ask you, is this the document that you received from Mr. LeGrand in response to your conversation with him that he should call Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: And was a copy of this letter -- does this letter indicate a copy was sent to Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: Um --
Mr. Mesereau: Foundation.
Hamid Moslehi: It says carbon copy --
The Court: Just a moment.
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sorry.
Mr. Auchincloss: This is offered as foundation.
The Court: All right. Overruled.
Mr. Auchincloss: Does it indicate that a copy was sent to Mr. Jackson?
Hamid Moslehi: This letter is signed by David LeGrand and it's carbon copy, cc, to Michael Jackson, Ronald Konitzer, John Genga.
Mr. Auchincloss: And the facsimile page on the front, the first page, does it also indicate that copy was sent to Mr. Jackson at Neverland Valley Ranch?
Hamid Moslehi: That is correct.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. Offer 851 into evidence, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation and hearsay.
The Court: I need to see the document.
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes. It is offered as an authorized admission, as well as it is offered for nonhearsay purposes to show knowledge on behalf of the defendant. There is one further authentication issue that I will mention; that this is defense discovery to the People, so this is a copy of a document that's in the defendant's possession.
The Court: That doesn't authenticate anything. The only foundational issue that I just have a quandary about is how he knows that this is from -- who it purports to be from.
Mr. Auchincloss: It's a response to --
The Court: No, how the witness knows, not how you know.
Mr. Auchincloss: No, I mean his testimony is that he called Mr. LeGrand that day and received this letter.
The Court: I'd like to hear from -- I'll allow you to -- before I rule on the foundation issue, I'll allow you to ask him any other questions you have on that issue to --
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you.
The Court: -- authenticate that.
Mr. Auchincloss: Mr. Moslehi, how long after the conversation with Mr. LeGrand on the 21st -- first of all, let me ask you, did you receive this communication, Exhibit 851, before or after you spoke to Mr. LeGrand on the phone?
Hamid Moslehi: After.
Mr. Auchincloss: How much time after?
Hamid Moslehi: A few hours.
Mr. Auchincloss: And this document references a communication regarding future -- your business affairs that is -- that you are to have with Dieter Weizner and Ronald Konitzer on February 24th, 2003. Are you aware of that?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm sorry, um --
Mr. Auchincloss: If I may show you the exhibit again. Page two, paragraph two.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. I'm not sure what the procedure is.
The Court: Excuse me.
Mr. Auchincloss: Well, I'm --
The Court: Why are you showing him the document?
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll go about it the proper way.
Mr. Auchincloss: Would -- does this letter have a paragraph in this indicating that you are to communicate with Ronald Konitzer and Dieter on February 24th, 2003?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, it does.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you communicate with them on that date?
Hamid Moslehi: And prior, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you discuss this letter with them?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did they appear to understand and know about it?
Hamid Moslehi: They were playing games with me.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. But did they pretend that they didn't know about this letter, or did they --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'll strike the question.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Auchincloss: May I ask the next question?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: What do you mean they were playing games with you?
Hamid Moslehi: I would call Dieter, and Dieter would say call Ronald, and they were not responding to my phone calls properly. And they told me this was probably a misunderstanding, or -- you know, games.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right.
Hamid Moslehi: They were not sincere about their statements or, you know, whatever they had in mind.
Mr. Auchincloss: I would offer 851 into evidence at this time.
Mr. Mesereau: Same objection.
The Court: How did you know that that letter came from Mr. LeGrand?
Hamid Moslehi: Because it was faxed from his office, and it had a cover sheet and it's signed by Mr. LeGrand.
The Court: Did you recognize that signature?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe it was the first time I saw Mr. LeGrand's signature, but I had every reason to believe that that was from Mr. LeGrand.
The Court: All right. I'm going to reserve ruling on that. I have some problems with your foundation.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. I'll ask a couple more questions along those lines.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you subsequently received any faxes from Hale Lane, Attorneys at Law?
Hamid Moslehi: After that?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, I have.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did they look identical in terms of the appearance of the fax letterhead?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, they did.
Mr. Auchincloss: Have you subsequently received letters from David LeGrand?
Hamid Moslehi: After that one?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
Hamid Moslehi: I believe maybe I received one or two, and then he started communicating with my lawyer.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. As far as those letters go, did they match, did the signature match?
Hamid Moslehi: I never tried to look into the signature, see if it matches. Once I received that letterhead, I had every reason to believe that it's coming from David LeGrand.
Mr. Auchincloss: Did you -- this is a fax letter with a fax letterhead. Did you subsequently receive this letter by way of U.S. Mail?
Hamid Moslehi: I don't believe so.
Mr. Auchincloss: Okay. Thank you. No further questions.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Mesereau: May I see that exhibit?
Mr. Auchincloss: Uh-huh.
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Moslehi, if you had known that Janet Arvizo was living with someone who earned close to $80,000 a year, would you have loaned her that $2,000?
Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; assumes facts.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Hamid Moslehi: If I knew that Janet Arvizo was living with another husband or just a person that has $80,000?
Mr. Mesereau: Who was supporting her and who earned close to $80,000 a year, would you have loaned her the 2,000?
Hamid Moslehi: Well, at the time, my state of mind was different. I don't know. Today, probably not.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, the letter that the prosecutor just showed you, which purports to be from the Hale Lane law firm, is dated February 21st, 2003, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And you claim you did receive this letter, right?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: And in the letter, you were asked to return tapes, photos and other property of MJJ Productions by a certain date, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: Yes, it is.
Mr. Mesereau: The date you were supposed to return those properties was February 24th, 2003, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: I -- I'm not sure. I don't have it in front of me, but if you say so, I take your word.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And the letter suggested that your invoices will be addressed, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: I'm not looking at the document, but if you say so, I take your word.
Mr. Mesereau: And at some point after this letter was received, you obtained or received payment of $200,000, correct?
Hamid Moslehi: I believe a month after I received that letter, approximately a month after, I received.
Mr. Mesereau: So approximately late March 2003, you received payment of $200,000, true?
Hamid Moslehi: That's correct.
Mr. Mesereau: You never returned the tapes or photos referred to in the letter, true?
Hamid Moslehi: What does it refer in the letter?
Mr. Mesereau: Any tapes, photos or other property of MJJ Productions, or Michael Jackson or his affiliates.
Hamid Moslehi: I don't -- after 21st, I don't believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. To date, you haven't turned over all the tapes you did for Mr. Jackson, true?
Hamid Moslehi: Since my invoices were not paid in full, no.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. No further questions.
The Court: Was that 851 that you were quoting from?
Mr. Auchincloss: Yes.
The Court: All right. I'll admit it.
Mr. Auchincloss: No further questions.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, we do have a motion, and it probably ought to be heard before this witness leaves the general vicinity.
The Court: You have no other questions of this witness?
Mr. Mesereau: No, Your Honor.
The Court: And you have no other questions?
Mr. Auchincloss: No.
Mr. Sanger: Depending on the ruling on the motion.
The Court: Is it a motion that you already tried to make this morning?
Mr. Sanger: No. No, Your Honor.
The Court: Why don't you approach and tell me what it is. (Discussion held off the record at sidebar.)
The Court: What I'm going to do is require that the witness remain at the courthouse, and call your next witness. I think the way we'll handle this, the motion that the defense wishes to make, is that we'll stop a few minutes early so the jury gets a longer lunch, and we'll listen to the motion. Come forward, please. When you get to the witness stand, remain standing. Face the clerk and raise your right hand.
Message: TERRY PAULSEN Having been sworn, testified as follows:
Terry Paulsen: I do.
The Clerk: Please be seated. State and spell your name for the record.
Terry Paulsen: My name is Terry Paulsen. T-e-r-r-y; P-a-u-l-s-e-n.
The Clerk: Thank you.
Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. NICOLA:
Mr. Nicola: Good morning.
Terry Paulsen: Good morning.
Mr. Nicola: Would you mind scooting up by that microphone, please?
Terry Paulsen: Okay.
Mr. Nicola: And swivel that towards your mouth so that everybody can hear you. How are you this morning?
Terry Paulsen: Fine.
Mr. Nicola: Ms. Paulsen, who are you employed with?
Terry Paulsen: Huntel Systems.
Mr. Nicola: What is your position with Huntel Systems?
Terry Paulsen: I'm a senior billing analyst.
Mr. Nicola: How long have you been working in that capacity with Huntel?
Terry Paulsen: 27 years.
Mr. Nicola: And are you here today as the custodian of records for some documents from Huntel Systems?
Terry Paulsen: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: What kind of documents?
Terry Paulsen: They're phone calls made from an aircraft, telephone calls.
Mr. Nicola: Air-to-ground telephone calls?
Terry Paulsen: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Pursuant to a search warrant, did you provide the documents that I'm going to hand you marked as Exhibit 850, previously shown to counsel?
Terry Paulsen: Yes, these are ones I provided.
Mr. Nicola: Could you describe those documents briefly for the jury, please?
Terry Paulsen: It's phone calls made from an aircraft on February 7th, 2003.
Mr. Nicola: And the company that bill was sent to?
Terry Paulsen: It was sent to Xtra Jet out of Santa Monica, California.
Mr. Nicola: With respect to the contents of that exhibit, is that generally a phone bill?
Terry Paulsen: Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And is your company a company that bills for phone calls made from aircraft to the ground?
Terry Paulsen: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Does the document reflect information that's made in the regular course of the business of Huntel?
Terry Paulsen: Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: And Huntel is a telecommunications provider?
Terry Paulsen: Huntel is -- we're the billing vendor.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Is it part of your business to keep track of the kind of records that you're --
Terry Paulsen: Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Now, the entries in the phone record, do they begin on a particular page in that exhibit?
Terry Paulsen: They begin on page four.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Is there a page two or a page three in Exhibit 850?
Terry Paulsen: No, there is not.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Do you recall what is actually contained in the record of page two and three?
Terry Paulsen: One of it is just information on paying your bill by a credit card. The other was phone calls that did not pertain to the date that we were requesting to provide.
Mr. Nicola: Is it customary to provide only what is reflected in the search warrant, as far as your company is concerned?
Terry Paulsen: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And their request was for February 7th, 2003?
Terry Paulsen: February 7th or 8th, but there weren't calls on the 8th.
Mr. Nicola: Is the information on that document relied upon by your company in the regular course of its business?
Terry Paulsen: Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And do you rely on it being accurate?
Terry Paulsen: Yes, I do.
Mr. Nicola: And briefly describe for the jury how the information in those phone records is generated.
Terry Paulsen: When a customer makes -- or is flying in an airplane and they make a call, it goes from the airplane to a ground station, out a landline to the party that's being called. And when the call's completed, then the ground station records that in its memory. And once a week, we go into the system, we -- through a modem telephone line, computer program, we get that information out. And once a month, we process that into a telephone bill so it puts it in a format that can print on a bill, reads the information that's taken from the ground station.
Mr. Nicola: Does the ground station have an identifying number that shows up on the bill?
Terry Paulsen: Yes, it does.
Mr. Nicola: And, well, Your Honor, at this time I would offer 850 into evidence as a business record.
Mr. Sanger: No objection.
The Court: It's admitted.
Mr. Nicola: What I'm going to do, Miss Paulsen, is use the Elmo. “Input 4”, if you don't mind, Your Honor.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Nicola: If you would turn to line 25, I would just like to show you a sample line from this. If you could just start with the number 25 and explain to the jury what the items mean as you go from left to right as you look at the exhibit, please.
Terry Paulsen: Okay. Each call has its own item number. The date would be 2-07; would be it was made February 7th. They called El Monte, California. The phone number, the 626 number, is the number that they called. 6:57 p.m. is the time that they hung up from the call. So the call was made one minute prior to that, and one minute tells you how long the call lasted. “CCD” just means, years ago when these numbers were issued to companies, they were called calling cards. So it just -- “CCD” is calling card. Then the -- there's two charges per phone call, or the call's broken out into two different sections. One is the land time, and that's from the time, if I called you, you picked up the phone. From the time you pick up the phone till you hang it up, that's the land time. The air time is what is actually charged, and that's the time from when I pick up the phone in the airplane and I hang up the phone. That's the air time. So there's two different times. And you can tell by the time of day or by the number called which two calls go together. So in this case, Call 25 and 26 would go together. It was made over Troy, Alabama, and the phone number under that would be the phone number for Troy, Alabama.
Mr. Nicola: Is the number for the Troy, Alabama, place a ground station?
Terry Paulsen: Pardon?
Mr. Nicola: Is that what you would call a ground station?
Terry Paulsen: The ground station phone number.
Mr. Nicola: How does the wireless phone on the aircraft decide which ground station it's going to repeat at; do you know?
Terry Paulsen: Okay. As you're flying, the transmitter in the phone will pick up the strongest signal on the ground station. The ground station sends up signals, and it picks up the strongest one. So you don't have a choice of what station you're going through. It just picks it up and places a call. So if you're flying near Troy, it's going to pick up the Troy, Alabama, ground station.
Mr. Nicola: Now, with respect to the date stamp specifically on Item 25, it says 6:57 p.m. Is that 6:57 p.m. in any particular time zone? Or can you explain that for the jury, please?
Terry Paulsen: The time zone is the time zone that the ground station is located in. So if you're flying over Troy, Alabama, that would be the time of day at Troy, Alabama. If you're flying over Los Angeles, California, it would be the Los Angeles time, so there could be a difference in the time zones.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Miss Paulsen -- I wasn't done with the Elmo. If I could direct your attention, please -- and if I could have “Input 4” again, Your Honor -- to Line No. 40.
Terry Paulsen: Okay.
Mr. Nicola: And is that a call placed to Santa Ynez, California?
Terry Paulsen: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: You can read the area code and the number, please.
Terry Paulsen: The area code is (805) 688-9979.
Mr. Nicola: And the time of that call, please?
Terry Paulsen: Is 8:39 p.m.
Mr. Nicola: And where is the aircraft now?
Terry Paulsen: The aircraft is over Artesia, New Mexico.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Could you please flip to the second page of the exhibit?
Terry Paulsen: Page five?
Mr. Nicola: Yes. And just tell the jury what time the last call was recorded from that aircraft.
Terry Paulsen: Line Item 71?
Mr. Nicola: Yes, please.
Terry Paulsen: It was placed at 9:28 p.m. on February 7th over Grand Canyon, Arizona.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Thank you, Miss Paulsen. No further questions, Your Honor.
Mr. Sanger: Could I have that?
Mr. Nicola: Certainly.
Mr. Sanger: Just leave it up on the thing.
Mr. Nicola: Oh, on the --
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, I'm going to put this back up on the Elmo and....
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: Okay. It's your understanding that this reflects telephone calls made from an airplane that are eventually connected through to some landline somewhere, correct?
Terry Paulsen: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And when I say “landline”, it could be connected to a cell phone ultimately; is that right?
Terry Paulsen: It would still go through a landline to a cell phone. I mean, it goes out the ground station, however the ground station sends it out.
Mr. Sanger: When you're talking about Troy, Alabama, there's some ground station there, and essentially you're now hooked up with the phone system that we would hook into if we pick up the kind of phone we pick up in the courtroom, right?
Terry Paulsen: Right.
Mr. Sanger: And wherever that phone system then directs the call is the ultimate destination, right?
Terry Paulsen: Right.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And so just so we're all clear, you got two lines per call, right?
Terry Paulsen: Right.
Mr. Sanger: And the one line shows the number that's called -- actually both lines show the number that's called, correct?
Terry Paulsen: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then the second line shows the charge to the airline; is that right?
Terry Paulsen: Right.
Mr. Sanger: Now, first of all, the billing goes to a particular airplane or a particular company?
Terry Paulsen: Particular company.
Mr. Sanger: And so the company that owns the airplane will get the bill?
Terry Paulsen: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Can you tell which airplane that belongs to that company was the source of the telephone call?
Terry Paulsen: No, I cannot.
Mr. Sanger: So if an airplane -- private charter airplane company might have several planes, and their phone bill will not distinguish between one airplane and another; is that correct?
Terry Paulsen: It will distinguish between one phone number and another, but not one airplane and another.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And on the airplane, you have no idea how big these airplanes are; is that true?
Terry Paulsen: They're private aircraft. I'm -- I would assume like a jet or something, but I do not know, no.
Mr. Sanger: Yeah. So you're making some assumptions, but you don't know how many people, for instance, would be on the airplane, right?
Terry Paulsen: No.
Mr. Sanger: And you have no way of determining what person on the airplane made the call, correct?
Terry Paulsen: No, I don't.
Mr. Sanger: So let's assume hypothetically that an airplane had two pilots, 11 passengers, and a crew member. Assume that as a hypothetical. Of those 14 people, would you have any way to determine from your records who made these phone calls?
Terry Paulsen: No.
Mr. Sanger: Now, I do note that there are some phone calls, a number of them that are -- if we look at the exhibit, and this is Exhibit 850, I believe; is that correct? You have the actual exhibit in front of you.
Terry Paulsen: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And what's on the board is a copy of the same exhibit?
Terry Paulsen: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: So if we look up at the top there where it says, “Minute”, or “M-I-N” --
Terry Paulsen: Uh-huh, yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- what is the minimum unit of time that will be recorded on your bill?
Terry Paulsen: The minimum is -- you'll see there's a couple that are short-term charges that are 20 to 30 seconds. But the minimum usually is 30 seconds. But 20 seconds on.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So on this particular bill, the minimum that we see on that page -- and I'm taking this off so I can see it up close. The minimum charge -- or, I'm sorry, the minimum recorded in the columns on this exhibit is one minute; is that right?
Terry Paulsen: Right. So it rounds up to a minute.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So if there's a shorter call, it's still going to show up as one minute on the -- in that column there; is that correct?
Terry Paulsen: Anything over 30 seconds will.
Mr. Sanger: And you also, from this bill, do not know if two people were actually able to talk to each another during these phone calls; is that correct?
Terry Paulsen: It will connect. If it doesn't connect, it doesn't register.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. It connects to another phone, right?
Terry Paulsen: Right.
Mr. Sanger: Now, this is basically a cell phone in the air, right?
Terry Paulsen: Similar to a cell phone.
Mr. Sanger: And when you're flying and using one of these phones, you have to basically hit the repeater down on the ground in order to make a connection, correct? Do you know what I mean, or am I using the wrong word?
Terry Paulsen: If you can, yeah, rephrase that for me.
Mr. Sanger: Well, you said it's like a cell phone in the air.
Terry Paulsen: Right.
Mr. Sanger: So while you're flying along, your signal from the cell phone in the air has to hit --
Terry Paulsen: A ground station.
Mr. Sanger: -- the ground station. And that's called a repeater, is it not, or do you know? Or a cell site?
Terry Paulsen: I have no idea.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Whatever it's called, you got to hit that thing, otherwise it doesn't work, right?
Terry Paulsen: Right.
Mr. Sanger: And when you hit it, there are places where you will -- you'll hit it and you'll make a connection, but you will not have a clear enough connection to actually talk; is that correct?
Terry Paulsen: There's that possibility, yes.
Mr. Sanger: So it's, in that sense, like a cell phone; that you can have bad reception, and you can be saying, “Can you hear me now?” And somebody on the other side is saying, “What?” Right?
Terry Paulsen: True.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So you do not know, from all these phone calls, how many actual conversations occurred between human beings where they could hear each other and communicate; is that correct?
Terry Paulsen: No.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Thank you very much. No further questions, Your Honor.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. NICOLA:
Mr. Nicola: You mentioned that sometimes the airline charges will be together and you need to look at the actual time of a call that goes out?
Terry Paulsen: Uh-huh.
Mr. Nicola: If I could have the Elmo just one more time, Your Honor.
Terry Paulsen: Excuse me.
Mr. Nicola: I think we have an example here, line --
The Court: I'm going to break now for the argument. (To the jury) Go ahead and take your recess.
Mr. Nicola: Oh, the motion.
The Court: You may step down.
Mr. Nicola: Step down.
The Court: (To the audience) All right. Please remain seated. There's a motion that's going to be made. All right, Counsel. Go ahead. Do you want to make your motion?
Mr. Sanger: Yeah. (Indicating.)
The Court: Oh, I'm sorry.
Message: The following proceedings were held in open court outside the presence and hearing of the jury:
Mr. Auchincloss: Your Honor, would you like the witness to leave the courtroom?
The Court: No. She may well want to. She's free to do so, but she doesn't -- she's not required.
Mr. Nicola: Are we back in session at 11:45, Your Honor?
The Court: At the end of our break, yes. Go ahead.
Mr. Sanger: On behalf of Mr. Jackson, we are making a motion for mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct. And the grounds for that motion for mistrial are that the Court ruled, as Your Honor reminded me, at a 402 motion that we would not be allowed to play this tape in its -- in the prosecution's case-in-chief.
The Court: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: I made another motion contemporaneous in time, having felt that it was appropriate to do so. The Court summarily, and I think clearly, denied the motion.
The Court: And correctly. No, all right, go ahead. (Laughter.)
The Court: You don't have to say that.
Mr. Sanger: I'm going to assert my Fifth Amendment rights on that. I said that humorously, for the record.
The Court: I took it humorously, for the record.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you. The serious part here, though, is that Mr. Auchincloss deliberately overreached. And the harm is, that having -- the Court having made such a clear ruling, he attempted to gain benefit from the Court's ruling that he wasn't entitled to. Your Honor said we couldn't go into it, so he got up and went into it, and that was clearly inappropriate to start with. And it seemed calculated and intentional. Now, I can't read his mind. But I can't figure out how he could have missed that, after we just had a hearing on it. Your Honor made an admonition -- and unfortunately my Livenote is not hooked up today, so I can't quote verbatim, but Your Honor has it. You gave an admonition to Mr. Auchincloss not to do that, and you explained to him exactly why; that you had just ruled, and it's not appropriate for him to go into that same area. He persisted and asked at least two more direct questions that just flew right in the face of the Court's ruling. And the questions were not innocent questions that were going around to try to get to something else. They were even more focused, to telegraph to the jury exactly what he wanted them to hear. And he wanted them to hear that, in his opinion, the issue with regard to, as I think he said, something like sleeping with boys was not one of those areas that this witness felt was unfairly portrayed. And he knew that he could get away with that because the Court was, at the very least, going to sustain the objection. We already couldn't go into it. There's nothing we could do about it. The bell has been rung, and this jury heard it. I think the harm is particularly significant, because it's been our position that clearly those statements were the statements that were grossly misrepresented by Mr. Bashir in the way he edited the film. So as a result of that, a tremendous amount of prejudice has occurred. It was deliberate on the part of the prosecutor. I say that, and that's my interpretation of what I saw. I don't think there's another reasonable interpretation. It's -- there's no other remedy, other than to grant a mistrial and say this is prosecutorial misconduct. It shouldn't have been done. As a result of their willful misconduct, a mistrial has to be granted. And that's our motion. If the Court denies that, then we would of course ask the Court to entertain some other remedy which I'd ask to be heard on later, but I'm making a motion for mistrial, and I think it should be granted. Thank you.
The Court: Counsel?
Mr. Auchincloss: To begin with, the questions that I was asking this witness about did not focus upon the material that was produced in the video, “The Footage You Were Never Meant To See”. And those questions were not designed and obviously were not intended to ask him about what was on that final production. My question went directly to an issue that defense counsel spent five pages questioning this witness about on cross-examination yesterday. And I have a couple of those items highlighted, and if the Court would allow me, I'd like to project them from the official transcripts.
The Court: Just read them to me.
Mr. Auchincloss: All right. First of all, Your Honor, counsel started by asking the question of this witness: “And the reason you were being interviewed by Brad Lachman Productions was because the intention was to have some of those parts that you had filmed appear in the rebuttal video, right?” And I objected. I say, “I'm going to object. Relevancy and beyond the scope. “Mr. Mesereau: I believe that he opened the entire door, Your Honor. “The Court: The objection is overruled. “Mr. Mesereau: In fact, the title of that documentary on television was, “The Michael Jackson Interview: .The Footage You Were Never Meant To See', right?” We go on. He questions him extensively about “The Footage You Were Never Meant To See”, including charities and Mr. Bashir's remarks. We get to an area here that's particularly interesting in which counsel says: “And your belief at that time was that Mr. Bashir had presented a very distorted view of that interview with Mr. Jackson, correct? “Mr. Auchincloss: Objection; calls for a conclusion. “Mr. Mesereau: State of mind, Your Honor. “Mr. Auchincloss: Relevance. “The Court: Overruled”. Now, this is an area that was clearly gone into by the defense, and my questions went directly to that question that defense counsel asked of this witness, that the -- that Martin Bashir presented a very distorted view, and my questions went directly to those remarks.
The Court: You went from the general concept, which I allowed, to the specifics, which I was not allowing. The motion for a mistrial is denied. All right. We'll take our break.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, just -- if I may --
The Court: I'll let you address the issue of alternative remedies. I thought you said you wanted to do that later.
Mr. Sanger: Well, later. Whenever you want.
The Court: I will. I'll let you do that.
Mr. Sanger: Okay.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
Mr. Mesereau: I don't think Mr. Sanger is here, Your Honor. I think he was intending to present some potential remedies to the Court.
The Court: Yes, that's what I thought he was going to do. They're waving at you.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, okay. No, I said Mr. Sanger doesn't appear to be here, and I think he wanted to present some alternative remedies to the Court. And unfortunately, I don't know where he is. (Laughter.)
The Court: Perhaps we should just call the jury in and we could take up that issue later. Maybe he's doing some research on that.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, Your Honor. Thank you.
Mr. Nicola: He may wish to recross after I redirect Miss Paulsen. He may wish to recross.
The Court: This is his witness?
Mr. Nicola: Yes.
The Court: So we have to wait for him no matter what.
Mr. Nicola: If you say I could be back on Friday, I'll go look for him right now, Judge. Maybe he's in the law library?
Mr. Mesereau: I really don't know.
A Voice From The Audience: There he is.
The Bailiff: Yea. (Laughter.)
The Court: I'm sorry. I came out; I didn't know you were not here yet.
Mr. Sanger: I apologize. I had to go back to my office and get something here.
The Bailiff: I'm sorry, I thought he was here. Sorry.
Mr. Sanger: Do you want to address the --
The Court: If you're prepared. I came on so that you could do that. I don't know if you wanted to do it now or later. I misinterpreted what you had said earlier, so....
Mr. Sanger: That's fine, Your Honor. The reason I wanted to bring it up sooner rather than later is that if the Court fashioned a remedy that involved Mr. Moslehi, he would be here; and if you didn't, he could leave. So let me just address it quickly. The motion for mistrial having been denied, and without conceding anything in that regard, our alternative request would be to either have, number one, an admonition to the jury that it was inappropriate to continue to ask those questions and that you had precluded the defense from getting into it, and make it very clear that those -- the questions, as the jury's been instructed, are not to be considered unless there's an answer. But in this particular case, because you had already made rulings very clearly, you want to make sure that there's no unfair inference drawn, even if it's a subconscious or subliminal one. So some instruction to that effect, a curative instruction of some sort to try to get us back to square one and unring the bell. Absent that --
The Court: “You're to disregard any subliminal messages you received during the last session?” (Laughter.)
Mr. Sanger: I'm sure we could word something more artfully than the concept that I just floated there, but I think there is something that could be done by way of a curative instruction to try to unring that bell. And I think it was unfairness and it was a matter of seizing on what the Court has just ruled on, and I think that's the big harm. It's not a matter that -- it's a matter that the prosecution had objected to our bringing that tape in and then sought to gain the benefit of the Court's continued ruling. If the Court does not do that, then I would ask -- or in the alternative, either way, I'd ask the Court to allow us to now just play the outtakes, and that's --
The Court: That's where I thought you were going.
Mr. Sanger: I didn't want to disappoint. (Laughter.)
Mr. Sanger: And it's a fair way to do it, Your Honor. The outtakes are the outtakes. And if the jury sees that, they'll be able to form their own opinion and they won't be dealing with subliminal matters. They'll be dealing with liminal matters. I'll submit it.
The Court: (To Mr. Auchincloss) You can sit down. You know, I don't believe that Mr. Auchincloss seized the moment to take advantage of you after objecting. You know, I think there was a disconnect from -- in his brain somewhere about -- because he was worried about the earlier examination that had been done. And I just don't believe he was trying to do something to confront the Court or affront the Court. And I think I, you know, saved the day by objecting myself, stopping it. So the jury has -- knows that I did not think that was proper. They got the message loud and clear. I've never done that before in this trial, so it was a very loud message I sent. So I think that's sufficient in this case. So, do you have your witness here if we bring in the jury?
Mr. Nicola: Yes, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. And, you know, the issue of the playing those tapes still remains for your part of the case. That may well be. So if there's a foundational issue here, you had suggested that the prosecution might agree. I would like that out of the way, because I don't think -- if all we need is to have him come back, when all you want to do is play the tapes, we wouldn't want to have to do that. You may want him back, too. I don't know. But if that's something we could agree on, playing those outtakes without a further foundation from him, if either of the parties desire, I think that would be a good thing to do. But you can talk to each other about that.
Mr. Sanger: Very well, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: And is it permissible for Mr. Moslehi to leave? He's waiting for us.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Auchincloss: Thank you.
The Court: But you understand my issue on --
Mr. Auchincloss: I do. And I think that's something --
The Court: -- whether you want to agree to a foundational issue that he took those tapes. We've all watched them.
Mr. Auchincloss: I'm certain if it's merely authentication, we can come to some agreement.
The Court: Okay. I'll leave while you bring the jury in.
Message: The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence and hearing of the jury:
The Court: All right, Counsel. Proceed, please.
Mr. Nicola: Thank you, Your Honor. May I have -- “Input 4” is already on.
Mr. Nicola: Miss Paulsen, if I could direct your attention to Item 29 and 30. There appear to be two air link charges right behind each other. Is that an example of what you testified to on direct as having to look for the corresponding number to figure out which charges go together?
Terry Paulsen: Yes, it is. Item 27 and 29 would go together. And Item 28 and 30 would go together.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And Item 27 is registered in the bill as a two-minute call to the same telephone number as Item 25; is that correct?
Terry Paulsen: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Once a call gets past one minute, does it register automatically in your system as a two-minute call?
Terry Paulsen: Anything over one minute, if it goes over a minute, it registers as two minutes.
Mr. Nicola: Thank you, Mrs. Paulsen. I have nothing further.
Mr. Sanger: Nothing further, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. Thank you. You may step down.
The Court: Call your next witness.
Mr. Nicola: The next witness will be Gabe Dominguez, Your Honor.
Mr. Sanger: Which exhibit?
Mr. Nicola: With T-Mobile. Stop that witness. Oh, he got it. Never mind.
The Court: Raise your right hand, please.
Message: GABRIEL DOMINGUEZ Having been sworn, testified as follows:
Gabriel Dominguez: I do.
The Clerk: Please be seated. State and spell your name for the record.
Gabriel Dominguez: Gabriel Dominguez. G-a-b-r-i-e-l; last name D-o-m-i-n-g-u-e-z.
The Clerk: Thank you.
Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. NICOLA:
Mr. Nicola: Good morning, sir. How are you?
Gabriel Dominguez: I'm fine.
Mr. Nicola: Are you here as a custodian of records for the telephone company T-Mobile?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: How long have you been employed with T-Mobile, please?
Gabriel Dominguez: For over four years.
Mr. Nicola: And have you testified before as a custodian of records for T-Mobile?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Approximately how many occasions?
Gabriel Dominguez: Over 60 or 70 times.
Mr. Nicola: Is that your primary role with T-Mobile?
Gabriel Dominguez: It is one of them.
Mr. Nicola: You go to court and authenticate the records that were asked for pursuant to subpoena and search warrant?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. With respect to this particular case, did your company send records pursuant to search warrant for phone records for the following individuals: Christopher Carter; Franchesco Cascio; Vincent Amen; Evelyn Tavasci; and Christian Robinson?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: In front of you is Exhibit 452. Do you recognize that?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: How do you recognize that?
Gabriel Dominguez: I recognize this to be subscriber information and billing records, or called detail records, for the people you just mentioned.
Mr. Nicola: Is there a table of contents in that exhibit?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Have you compared the contents of the exhibit with the table of contents?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Have you looked through the entire exhibit prior to your testimony today?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Generally, and I mean this with respect to all the documents in that exhibit, save the table of contents, are they records that are made in the regular course of T-Mobile business?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Now, with respect to the specific subscriber information within those exhibits, is the information recorded on the subscriber report made by persons under a duty to record the information accurately at or near the time that the information is relayed to them?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Would you explain to the jury what a subscriber record is?
Gabriel Dominguez: A subscriber record is a customer's name, address, Social Security number, and any identifying information for that customer.
Mr. Nicola: Why do you need that information?
Gabriel Dominguez: For billing purposes.
Mr. Nicola: I'd like you to turn specifically to Tab No. 1, and is that the information for one Christopher Carter?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And Tab No. 2, please, is that the information for Franchesco Cascio?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Tab No. 3, please, is that the information for Vincent Amen?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Tab No. 4 and Tab No. 5 respectively, Evelyn Tavasci and Christian Robinson?
Mr. Sanger: I'm going to object. That's compound.
The Court: Overruled.
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. With respect to the contents of Tab 1, the records pertaining to Christopher Carter, are there also bills which include phone tolls?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Are those records also kept in the regular course of T-Mobile business?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Do you regularly rely upon those records in generating revenue?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Do you rely on their accuracy?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Mr. Dominguez, with respect to Christopher Carter, is the phone number listed on the table of contents the same phone number that appears on the record within Tab No. 1 of Exhibit 452?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And with respect to Franchesco Cascio, is the phone number listed on the table of contents the same as the phone number listed on the pages of Tab 2?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: How about with Vincent Amen; same question with respect to Tab 3?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And I have the same question for Evelyn Tavasci, Tab 4.
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And Christian Robinson, Tab 5?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Do the phone tolls for each of the individuals that we've just named extend from a period of January through March of 2003?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. With respect to the Christian Robinson subscriber information in Tab 5, is there also another name in the subscriber report?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And what is that, please?
Gabriel Dominguez: Site LLC.
Mr. Nicola: Is there another document right behind that that has the name Christian Robinson on it?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And what is that document?
Gabriel Dominguez: That is the front page of a bill.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. What does it say on the top left-hand corner?
Gabriel Dominguez: The top line says, “Site LLC”. Second line says, “Attention: Christian Robinson”.
Mr. Nicola: With the Court's permission, we'd offer this into evidence so we can project it.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, before you rule --
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- my understanding is they're offering the entire book as an exhibit. Is that correct?
Mr. Nicola: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And I object, because the entire book -- there's material in at least the book that was given to me that has not been covered by the prosecution, and I would like an opportunity to approach the witness and see what is in that book.
The Court: You may.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you. Your Honor, can I have a moment to speak with counsel for just a --
The Court: Yes. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Nicola: We're having a -- trying to explain the different table of contents, Your Honor.
The Court: That's fine.
Mr. Sanger: It's more than that. There are things that were removed from the book and we're just trying to figure out which book is right. And there we go. Based on what I've now seen, I will withdraw -- if I objected, I'll withdraw it. Otherwise, I'll submit it.
The Court: All right. I'll admit it.
Mr. Nicola: Thank you, Your Honor. May we have “Input 4”, please?
Mr. Nicola: If you could turn to the subscriber record for Christopher Carter located under Tab No. 1, and is this the account information that it contains for Mr. Carter for the phone number that appears at the very top of the exhibit, (702) 234-9059?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And is the work telephone number gathered at the time that the account is opened?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And for this exhibit, it is -- or for this account, it is (818) 910-5505?
The Court: I just cut the screen on this. You're showing a person's Social Security number and address, and I don't think you should be doing that.
Mr. Nicola: A little brain dead right now. I apologize.
Mr. Nicola: Can you turn to, in your book, the exhibit that begins with -- I believe it's 29 of 32 for Chris Carter's number. Okay. It's the exhibit in Mr. Carter's bill that begins with roaming charges, 29 of 32. Do you have it in front of you?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Is the first entry on that dated 1-31-03, Miami, Florida?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Just one second before we do this. Before we do this, let me just have a moment.
Mr. Nicola: Maybe we should kill that. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sanger: Now, having resolved that, I guess I have a belated question. We had raised it earlier with regards to Mr. Jackson's phone numbers. I mean, we are putting everybody's phone numbers up on the board.
Mr. Nicola: May we approach so we can -- I have a solution for that that will take two seconds to discuss at sidebar.
The Court: All right. (An off-the-record discussion was held at sidebar.)
Mr. Nicola: May I proceed with the Elmo, Your Honor?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Excuse me, the “Input 4”.
Mr. Nicola: We were talking about the -- this document in the T-Mobile exhibit. If you could just explain generally the highlighted area and what they mean for the jury, please.
Gabriel Dominguez: The first column shows the date that that call took place. The following column under “Call Destination”, that shows the city called. And that's also an outgoing call. Column after that shows the time that that call took place. The “Number Called” is either the number called or received. And then the duration.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. How do we know if a call has been received?
Gabriel Dominguez: If a call has been received, it would show “incoming”. So if you look at where it says, January 31st, 2003, at 6:27 p.m., that's an incoming call, and that's how you can tell it's an incoming call, because it says so.
Mr. Nicola: Sometimes the incoming call will record in there and sometimes it will not?
Gabriel Dominguez: Um -- explain.
Mr. Nicola: Well, if it's an incoming call, will the --
Gabriel Dominguez: Where the number doesn't show up, it's because the person is blocking their number or our system did not catch a date and incoming number.
Mr. Nicola: Let me ask you about the code highlighted parentheses “A”. What does that mean?
Gabriel Dominguez: If you were to look at the bottom of the page, there's a legend that displays the call type and what the “A” would stand for. “A” stands for call waiting.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Let me move that up.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, I'm very sorry. This is -- this is -- yeah, I understand. This is somewhat piecemeal here.
The Court: Did you want me to black out the screen while you --
Mr. Sanger: Could you please, Your Honor? This -- this -- I don't want to argue in front of the jury, but the availability -- this witness is not being called, as I understand it -- I don't think there's relevance to these phone records. And I know I submitted it. And now that I'm hearing what is being presented from these records, I think I should object to this exhibit or move to strike this exhibit based on irrelevancy, at least this Tab No. 1, unless there's something that's going to connect it up at some point in this case.
The Court: I assume you are entering this information for a purpose.
Mr. Nicola: We are, Your Honor. And I don't want to argue this in front of the jury.
The Court: Okay. I'm going to allow -- I'm going to deny the motion to strike and go forward.
Mr. Nicola: Thank you.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. The different call types are listed on the bottom of the billing page?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And “A” is for call waiting?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: For those of you who don't know how call waiting works, can you explain that real quickly for us?
Gabriel Dominguez: When someone receives an incoming call, they'll hear a tone telling them then there's a call on the other end. What they would do then is they would switch over to the other line, and they could speak to the other person. And when they're finished, they can terminate that call and continue with the phone call they -- they initially originated or whoever called them originally.
Mr. Nicola: So the subscriber is on the phone?
Gabriel Dominguez: Right.
Mr. Nicola: Another call comes in; he hears a beep?
Gabriel Dominguez: Right.
Mr. Nicola: Pushes a button; can talk to the other person on the phone without hanging up on the first one?
Gabriel Dominguez: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. What about call forwarding?
Gabriel Dominguez: Call forwarding. Call forwarding works -- if you wanted to receive a call, but you wanted to forward it to a different number, someone calls you, that number, then that call then goes to the number that you forwarded it to.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Say, someone has their home phone number forwarded to their cell phone. Would that register as an incoming call on the cell phone?
Gabriel Dominguez: It would -- on the record, it would show the incoming number from the person that's calling. It wouldn't show the number where it's being forwarded to.
Mr. Nicola: And if you forward your cell phone to a different number, will the number that called, that was forwarded, show up on the bill?
Gabriel Dominguez: No.
Mr. Nicola: With respect to the “G” in parentheses, what is that code for?
Gabriel Dominguez: Voice mail.
Mr. Nicola: So if somebody is checking their voice mail, it will show up on the bill as voice mail retrieval?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And then get charged for that?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes, if they go over their allotted minutes.
Mr. Nicola: Are there different sections of this particular bill for Mr. Carter? For example, this one here has a header called “Roaming Charges”.
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes. There would be another bill, just the regular billed charges of calls that he made while he was in his home area.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And with respect to the charges listed under this heading, “Roaming Charges”, can you tell us where the phone that was being used to dial out, say, to this number here, the 305 number, where that phone was?
Gabriel Dominguez: In the Miami/Dade area, or Southern Florida.
Mr. Nicola: And how can you tell that?
Gabriel Dominguez: On the top left-hand corner above the date, it says, “Miami/Dade”.
Mr. Nicola: Right there where I'm pointing?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Now, if it is not under a “Roaming Charges” section in the bill, where does “Call Destination” correspond to?
Gabriel Dominguez: The “Call Destination” doesn't actually correspond to the physical location of the outgoing number that they're calling. A few years ago the area code and prefix used to correspond to a specific geographic area. Now, with cell phones, they can be pretty much anywhere.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. If you could turn to page 4 of 23 on the March 5th bill. Are we looking at the same page here?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. So where it says, “2-9-03, Santa Ynez, California”, the time and the phone number, is that under one of the regular billing headers?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. So the call was not placed from Santa Ynez, as far as the bill is concerned?
Gabriel Dominguez: Right.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And, now, is Santa Ynez a region that just shows up on the bill because of a --
Gabriel Dominguez: Because of the area code and prefix.
Mr. Nicola: And that destination tied in with the phone number that was dialed?
Gabriel Dominguez: No.
Mr. Nicola: How does that work?
Gabriel Dominguez: The area code and prefix are the first six numbers. The area code, being 805 the prefix being 688, that belongs to Santa Ynez.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. If you can move on, please, to the documents in Tab 2 for Franchesco Cascio, do those records show a work telephone number for him of Area Code (818) 905-0386?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. If you'd turn to page -- or Tab 3, please, for Vincent Amen. If you could turn to the bill dated February 21st, 2003. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Nicola: I'd like to show you an example of an incoming call with respect to the phone call which registered 2-11-03, 2:30 p.m, that's highlighted. Do you see that?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: What does the “F” mean?
Gabriel Dominguez: “F” means mobile-to-mobile. The number that is being dialed or received is another T-Mobile customer.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Does that work outside of your calling network?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: So if someone with AT&T Wireless on a mobile phone dials the owner of this cell phone, will their number show up here?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes, but it wouldn't have an “F” behind it.
Mr. Nicola: So this is within the same calling area?
Gabriel Dominguez: No, it's within the same company. They're both T-Mobile customers.
Mr. Nicola: So there's no charge?
Gabriel Dominguez: There's no charge, because they can either be within their allotted minutes, or if they have part of their price plan all T-Mobile to T-Mobile, calls can be free.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. I'd like you to turn to the next tab, please, the records for Ms. Evelyn Tavasci. I'm going to take this down. On the subscriber record, do you see the home telephone number of Miss Tavasci?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And is that the same number that is listed in Christopher Carter's subscriber information as being a work number?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Thank you, Mr. Dominguez. Your witness, Mr. Sanger.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: Good afternoon.
Gabriel Dominguez: Good afternoon.
Mr. Sanger: We always have to look at the clock when we say that, because we don't know when it's noon around here.
The Court: Some of us. (Laughter.)
Mr. Sanger: Oh. Some may be painfully aware, I suppose.
Mr. Sanger: All right. You have testified to some records that are in front of you there, and the fact that -- let me withdraw that. These particular telephones are mobile telephones. They're cell phones, right?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So these are not phones that are associated with a particular address. I mean, you have a billing address and that sort of thing, but they're not stuck someplace, right?
Gabriel Dominguez: No.
Mr. Sanger: Secondly, you mentioned that the Tab No. 4, Evelyn Tavasci phone, and the Tab No. 1, Christopher Carter phone, have a similar -- or have the same number on the - what would you call it? - subscriber database; is that right?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yeah, the one has the number for being the work, and the other has it for their home telephone number.
Mr. Sanger: Just to make this a little more clear, the actual telephone number for the records -- in other words, you have billing records behind each tab, right?
Gabriel Dominguez: Right.
Mr. Sanger: Are the billing records for Tab No. 1 for the same telephone number as Tab No. 4?
Gabriel Dominguez: No.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And all that you show there is that in the subscriber database where you have other telephone numbers for people, this telephone number ending in 5005 shows up in both of those bases; is that correct?
Gabriel Dominguez: One shows up in the work telephone slot, because that was the number that they gave when they signed up for their account as to what their work telephone number was. The other one shows that number as being their home telephone number, because that was the information they gave when they set up the account as that being their home telephone.
Mr. Sanger: And obviously you're here as custodian of records. You weren't there when these were signed up. You don't know who did it, right?
Gabriel Dominguez: No.
Mr. Sanger: Is it common for a company or an organization to purchase a number of telephones from your company?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And they would have similar subscriber information for more than one telephone on occasion; is that correct?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes. For a large corporation, yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And finally, the fact that these phone records -- these billing records are billed to a particular person, it says, “Statement For” up in the right-hand corner; is that correct?
Gabriel Dominguez: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: The fact that it says, “Statement For”, Christopher Carter or Franchesco Cascio or any of the others, does that the mean that those particular individuals were using the telephone on that day?
Gabriel Dominguez: No, it does not.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Thank you. I have no further questions.
Mr. Nicola: Nor do I, Your Honor.
The Court: Thank you. You may step down.
Mr. Nicola: Pacific Bell, Anne Marie Sims, Your Honor.
The Court: On Exhibit 452, I'll order that the District Attorney provide redacted pages for those pages that have home addresses, Social Security numbers, and unrelated phone numbers on them.
Mr. Sanger: Just to clarify while we're waiting, I take it that your ruling on the motion to strike is without prejudice to renewing it if it isn't connected up.
The Court: It is, correct.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you.
The Court: Come forward, please. When you get to the witness stand, please remain standing. Face the clerk. Raise your right hand.
Message: ANNE MARIE SIMS Having been sworn, testified as follows:
Anne Marie Sims: I do.
The Clerk: Please be seated. State and spell your name for the record.

Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. NICOLA:
Mr. Nicola: Good afternoon, ma'am.
Anne Marie Sims: Hello.
Mr. Nicola: What company do you work for?
Anne Marie Sims: SBC.
Mr. Nicola: You're here about telephone numbers.
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Surprise. How long have you been with SBC?
Anne Marie Sims: It will be 25 years in May.
Mr. Nicola: We placed in front of you Exhibit 451, I believe; is that correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And are you familiar with the contents of Exhibit 451?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Now, with respect to your role here as custodian of records for Pacific Bell, how long have you been working for them in that capacity?
Anne Marie Sims: Two years.
Mr. Nicola: And have you testified on a number of occasions as a custodian of records?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Have you had an opportunity to look at the records contained within Exhibit 451 prior to today's date?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And is there a table of contents in the front portion?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Have you compared the information under the subscriber name and the subscriber phone number with the records which are contained within that exhibit?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Did you find that they corresponded?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And is the table of contents accurate?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: With respect to generally the entire exhibit, are the records in there, save the table of contents, records which are made in the ordinary course and scope of the business of Pacific Bell?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And is the information contained within Exhibit 451 recorded at or near the time of the events that they purport to relate?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And is this exhibit -- excuse me, are the contents of this exhibit records that you normally rely upon in conducting the business of Pacific Bell?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: We'd move this into evidence at this time, Your Honor.
The Court: It's admitted.
Mr. Sanger: Excuse me, Your Honor. I was going to ask counsel and he started too soon. May I just approach and --
The Court: I'll withdraw my ruling until you've had an opportunity to look at them.
Mr. Sanger: Just take a quick look at them. Thank you.
Mr. Nicola: Ahh.
Mr. Sanger: May I borrow that for a second? I'll submit it, but again, relevance has not been demonstrated as yet.
The Court: All right. They're admitted, subject to that same proviso.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you.
Mr. Nicola: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Nicola: In Tab No. 1, I believe there are the records of Ms. Evvy Tavasci.
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Is that correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And the phone lines that you'll be referring to contained within Exhibit 451, are they cellular phones or are they hard lines that go into houses, business lines?
Anne Marie Sims: They're landlines, wire lines.
Mr. Nicola: Do you have two phone numbers listed for Ms. Tavasci's home? You don't have to tell us what they are. Are they within the table of contents?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And is the one ending in 0088 the second line into that home?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And the one ending in 5005 the primary line?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Are there specific billing information records within the exhibit for Evvy Tavasci, Tab No. 1, for the period between approximately January and March of 2003?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: If you could move to Tab No. 2. Are those the billing and subscriber information records for Ms. Azja Pryor?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And if you could move to Tab No. 3. Contained within that tab, do you find the billing and toll information for a business entitled, “Neverland Valley Entertainment”?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And are there five separate phone lines going into that business that you have record of?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And are all those phone numbers reflected in the records within Tab No. 3?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: I have the same question about exhibit number -- excuse me, Tab No. 4 in Exhibit No. 451. Is that the subscriber and billing records of one Miko Brando?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Moving on to Tab No. 5, please, subscriber and billing records for David Ventura?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: I would like to show you a page from that, if I may. If you could turn to the March 12th section of the bill. It would be a long-distance call. Okay. Do you have a call to Santa Ynez on that date?
Anne Marie Sims: On what date?
Mr. Nicola: Did I say March 12th? March 14th.
Anne Marie Sims: March 14th, yes. On March 14th?
Mr. Nicola: Yes.
Anne Marie Sims: Oh, yes.
Mr. Nicola: You do?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: If I may have the “Input”, Your Honor.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Is that the page you're looking at in the exhibit?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Perhaps we can just go over this one page. Is the phone number connected to David Ventura (626) 575-6162, this one up here?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: On this bill, can you explain these groups of numbers up here? The 8-1 of 9, what does that mean?
Anne Marie Sims: When we're looking at telephone accounts or bills in the computer, the screen can only show a third of the page, so -- or, you know, just a portion of the page that prints out on the actual customer's bill. So this would be like eight -- the eighth page, the first part of the screen in the computer.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. So --
Anne Marie Sims: And then there would be nine pages altogether.
Mr. Nicola: So this is part of page nine of the bill; is that right?
Anne Marie Sims: It would be, I believe, page eight. I don't know.
Mr. Nicola: Page eight out of nine pages, I'm sorry.
Anne Marie Sims: Right.
Mr. Nicola: It's confusing. That's why I'm trying to --
Anne Marie Sims: You're confusing me.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. So this is the eighth page, first computer screen --
Anne Marie Sims: Right.
Mr. Nicola: -- out of nine pages?
Anne Marie Sims: Right.
Mr. Nicola: Now, the call you were referring to, is that Item No. 10 listed down here?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: So on “MR14”, is that March 14?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: This is the 2003 bill at 2:15 p.m. A call was placed to that number down there?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: That's (805) 688-9788?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Would you please turn to the page immediately preceding that in the exhibit? Is that page No. 7-4 of 9?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: On the Ventura bill there appear to be calls both on February 13th and February 14th to a number in Morristown. And does that “NJ” stand for New Jersey?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And the number dialed was (201) 213-0763?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Can you tell over here under the “Minutes” column whether those are completed calls or not?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: How can you tell that?
Anne Marie Sims: Because they were printed on the bill.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. So if I call this number but hang up before someone else picks up the phone, it's not going to show up on my bill?
Anne Marie Sims: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And do you use the round up, take-whatever-you-can-get-from-the-consumer system of counting minutes?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: So a two-second call -- excuse me. I couldn't resist. A two-second telephone call with this company, completed, will cost a minute, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. So it's a little different than some other systems?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: A three-minute one-second call will register as four minutes, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: The most you can say about any of these numbers over here under “Minutes” is that this call, Item No. 9, lasted between three and four minutes; is that accurate?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. If we could go back to the table of contents, please. And Tab No. 6, are those the records for one Jay Jackson?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And is the telephone number for Jay Jackson (213) 739-9279?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Moving on to Tab 7, MJJ Productions, is the phone number for MJJ Productions listed as (310) 278-3383?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And how about the information for one Chris Tucker in Tab No. 9? Without telling us the phone number, is his information within Tab No. 9, is that information accurate?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: I'm going to ask you now about, in order, The Country Inn at Calabasas. Oh, yes. I'm sorry. Is their subscriber information under Tab 10?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: How about the next tab, Number 11, the L.A. City Board of Education, specifically Burroughs Junior High School? Is the subscriber information and telephone number in there as well?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And finally, No. 12 and 13, Kaiser Foundation and Enterprise Rent-A-Car respectively.
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. I have no further questions, Your Honor.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: Good afternoon. Let's start with Tab No. 9, and -- yeah, let me borrow that. And I'm going to ask you if you correlate a particular telephone number to Chris Tucker.
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Yes? And does that number end in 1861?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And in fact, it's (818) 757-1861. That's Chris Tucker's number; is that right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And I'm going to ask you to turn now to Tab 9. And with the Court's permission, I'm going to put up on the board -- I'm sorry, wait a second. Tab 6. Tab 6. With the Court's permission, I'm going to put up on the board a page from that exhibit, which appears to be February 8th at the top and then it says, “3-3 of 6”. Let's see if we have the same thing there. Are you looking at that page in the book?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So we're on the right page. Okay. Just a second. Oop, there it goes. All right. Sorry. This -- first of all, page six would be the phone number for Jay Jackson up in the upper left-hand corner; is that correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And that shows his phone number right up here, the upper left-hand corner above his name, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: The entry on line 16 is for February 4, 2003, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And at 6:11 p.m., it appears that a call -- is this made to or was received from?
Anne Marie Sims: Made to.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So the call was made to Reseda, California, to Chris Tucker's phone number, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And it lasted -- is that the amount of time right there, four --
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Four-minute call? All right. And then it appears that at 6:14 p.m., another call was made to Chris Tucker on February 4, that same number, that lasted about four minutes, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Now, you could not tell from the billing records, from this billing record, whether or not this particular billing record -- whether or not Chris Tucker called -- well, let me withdraw that. On this record, we see the two calls are made to that Chris Tucker number, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. I'm going to ask that -- if you leave it on for a second, Your Honor, I'm going to flip to another page. I'm going to ask that you go back to Tab 5, and I'm going to go to the page -- it's actually the first page that was shown to you by the prosecutor and the two pages after that. So it will be the March 26th, 2003, 8-1 of 9, 8-2 of 9. And then we'll go to the next page in the exhibit, in the way mine's organized anyway, which is the April 26th, 2003, 5-4 of 5. Is that the next page in your exhibit?
Anne Marie Sims: I -- I have 2-1 of 5 and then 5-4 of 5.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Well, I'm going to go to 5-4 of 5. So we've got those three?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Let's start with the first one. If I may, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: I'm going to put up this page. And this shows us that this is the telephone of David Ventura, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And it appears that on March the 12th -- and I'll just note that apparently there's some pen marks here that aren't on the actual exhibit, if I can be excused for that, but it's on my copy. Quite frankly, I must have done it, or somebody did. Other than that, look -- just look at the printed page here. On March 12, somebody at David Ventura's number is calling a number in Buellton two different times, at 5:08 p.m. and 7:02 p.m., right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then there's a number on March the 12th at 11:25 p.m. That's 35 minutes before midnight, right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And somebody, at half an hour or so before midnight, is calling Guadalupe, California, and calling a number there, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And talking for 35 minutes, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: There are a couple more calls on the 13th to Santa Ynez. And then on the evening of the 13th at 6:45 p.m., somebody at David Ventura's number is calling that same number in Guadalupe again. Do you see that?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And talking for 64 minutes. Right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And when it's 8:45, that's the start time of the call, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: So that call went on from 8:45 in the evening to 9:49, if I add it correctly, in the evening; is that right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes. Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you. You have to say “yes” or “no” for the court reporter there. Okay. Now, I'm going to -- and then the District Attorney already asked you about the last one, a call to Santa Ynez at 2:15 p.m. Let's go to the next page, if we may, with the Court's permission. And this is the next page of the phone bill, or the next computer screen of the phone bill; is that right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And again, this is David Ventura's telephone. Somebody in David Ventura's house on March the 14th, at 8:12 p.m., calls that same number in Guadalupe, talks for -- or is billed for a minute. So it was connected and it lasted less than 60 seconds, right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And then at -- on the 16th, which would be one minute after midnight on the early morning of March the 16th, there's a call to the same number from David Ventura's phone to that Guadalupe phone number, same number, right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Lasts 26 minutes, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And then March the 16th, that was just one minute after midnight, the first thing in the morning. The next one is later that night at 10:14 p.m. on March the 16th. Somebody's calling that same number in Guadalupe, California, right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Six minutes.
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then on the 17th, there are three telephone calls here that I'm pointing to, on lines 14, 15 and 16, and they are respectively at 6:28, 8:51 and 8:57 p.m. So somebody's trying to call someone at that same number in Guadalupe, and apparently concluding the call within a minute?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And then on March the 18th, somebody from Mr. Ventura's phone calls Guadalupe at 3:26 p.m., talks to someone at that same number, presumably, for 22 minutes, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then at 9 -- almost 9:30, 9:29 p.m. on the 18th, there's another call to that same Guadalupe number for 26 minutes; is that correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now I'm going to go to the next page I referred to. I'll put it up and I'll describe it. It's the next page in my book, but wherever it is in the official book it is. It's identified by the number at the top, April 26th, 2003, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And 5-4 of 5, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And this is David Ventura?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Now, here it shows a series of calls on 3-19 and 3-20 and 3-21. So March 19th through March 21st, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And this is still 2003, right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And somebody is calling from the Venturas' telephone, calling that very same number at Guadalupe; is that right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And without going too laboriously through this, the calls are in the evening of 3-19 at 7:10 p.m. for 36 minutes?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then that would have taken it from 7:10 to 7:46. So about 15 minutes later, at 8:01 p.m., there's another call to the same number for another 17 minutes, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then at 10:50 p.m. is another call for three minutes --
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- correct? And the next day, at 2:57 p.m., there's a three-minute call?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And later that evening, at 7:52, there's a three-minute call, correct?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then on 3-20, at 7:55 p.m. So it -- if I'm right, it looks like that three-minute call, there was a hang-up and a call right back; is that right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: So -- and that call then lasts for 20 minutes; is that right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then the next day, at 9:37 at night, there's a call to that same number in Guadalupe from the Ventura residence for one minute; is that right?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you. Oh, and before I leave, all -- I think the District Attorney asked you this, but just to be sure. All of these phones are landlines, so they're -- they're all connected by a wire to the wall?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: So the location that's indicated for the telephone is the location where that telephone actually is?
Anne Marie Sims: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Thank you. No further questions.
The Court: Counsel?
Mr. Nicola: No redirect, Your Honor. Oh, I'm sorry. I do have one question.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. NICOLA:
Mr. Nicola: With respect to a completed call on the phone bill, is there any way to -- any way to tell whether the call actually went to voice mail or whether it was live conversation?
Anne Marie Sims: No.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Thank you.
The Court: You say “yes” better than any witness I've ever had. (Laughter.)
Anne Marie Sims: Thank you.
The Court: You're excused.
Anne Marie Sims: Thank you.

Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. NICOLA:
Mr. Nicola: Any chance you're here to talk about phones?
Joseph Shebroe: I am.
Mr. Nicola: Which company, please?
Joseph Shebroe: Verizon Wireless.
Mr. Nicola: Are you here as the custodian of records for Verizon Wireless?
Joseph Shebroe: I am.
Mr. Nicola: How long have you been with Verizon Wireless?
Joseph Shebroe: A little over seven years.
Mr. Nicola: What is your current position?
Joseph Shebroe: I currently supervise a specialty customer service group called the Executive Relations Team.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. With respect to this particular case, were you sent here by your agency to testify about search warrant information that you sent to the court in People vs. Jackson?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, sir.
Mr. Nicola: Do you recognize the contents of Exhibit No. 456?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, I do.
Mr. Nicola: Go ahead and look through that, please. Have you had an opportunity to see Exhibit 456 prior to your testimony today?
Joseph Shebroe: I have.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And is there a table of contents?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, there is.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And is that a two-page table of contents?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, sir.
Mr. Nicola: Have you compared the information contained within each of the tabs with the corresponding information on the table of contents for each entry?
Joseph Shebroe: I have.
Mr. Nicola: And is the table of contents accurate with respect to what is actually within Exhibit 456?
Joseph Shebroe: It is.
Mr. Nicola: Does Exhibit 456 contain subscriber information for the following individuals under Tab No. 2: Deborah Rowe?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Jesus Salas?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Franchesco Cascio?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Paul Hugo?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, sir.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Does Exhibit No. 456, Tab 2, accurately reflect the telephone numbers for each of those subscribers?
Joseph Shebroe: It does.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Moving to Tab No. 3, does Tab No. 3 include the billing -- excuse me, the account summary for Mr. Cascio for the billing period of February of 2003?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, sir, it does.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Is that a phone number, (201) 213-0763?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Tab No. 4, does that contain what is -- what we put on the exhibit as an incoming/outgoing February 2003 heading for the number 213-0763?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Is that actually a document that's a switch record?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Could you explain what a switch record is for the jury?
Joseph Shebroe: Sure. A switch record is basically more -- it's not like a billing statement. It's the record that -- that the cell towers produce when a call is placed that we use kind of as a back end.
Mr. Nicola: I don't think they heard the last part of that.
Joseph Shebroe: Kind of as a back end. It's not something that's produced for the customer. It's the records that we use internally that then feeds to the billing system, which then generates a particular bill.
Mr. Nicola: Do you keep those particular records for a period of time?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, although I'm not sure of the exact amount of time we keep those for.
Mr. Nicola: Is it longer than a couple of weeks?
Joseph Shebroe: Absolutely.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Tab No. 5 are the contents of Mr. Cascio's March 2003 bill for the same phone number, 213-0763?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And the Tab No. 6, does that contain the switch records for the same period of time?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, the same time.
Mr. Nicola: And Tab No. 7, does that include Mr. Cascio's account summary for April of 2003, the same phone number?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, it does.
Mr. Nicola: Moving down to the next entries are Tab 10?
Joseph Shebroe: Uh-huh.
Mr. Nicola: Is there a Tab 11?
Joseph Shebroe: Not in the table of contents. There is in here.
Mr. Nicola: Are there two Tab 10s on the table of contents?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, there are.
Mr. Nicola: Would you take a look at the second Tab 10 and see if the contents should be marked as Tab 11, please?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Would you change that on the table of contents? Do you have a pen? So we do go now Tab 10 and Tab 11?
Joseph Shebroe: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And is that the account information for one Ms. Deborah Rowe?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: For February and March respectively?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Are the contents of Exhibit 456 records which you keep in the ordinary course of Verizon Wireless business?
Joseph Shebroe: They are.
Mr. Nicola: Is the information contained within Exhibit 456 recorded at or near the time of the events purported to be --
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, they are.
Mr. Nicola: -- purported to be in the exhibits?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, they are.
Mr. Nicola: All right. And does Verizon Wireless regularly rely upon the documents within 456 to conduct their business?
Joseph Shebroe: We do.
Mr. Nicola: We move that this exhibit be moved into evidence, Your Honor.
Mr. Sanger: May I approach and take a look?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Subject to a motion to strike if it's not connected, based on the prior ruling to the Court, I'll submit it.
The Court: I'll admit it with that proviso.
Mr. Nicola: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Nicola: Would you please turn to Frank Cascio's February billing statement, please, under Tab 3?
Joseph Shebroe: Okay.
Mr. Nicola: And could you please turn to what is marked as page 23 of 35?
Joseph Shebroe: Okay.
Mr. Nicola: This blacked-out section up above, is that something that your company does prior to sending the records in?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Makes it hard for us to do this. Can you read what the fourth column header is? Is that called “Origination”?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: If I go back down to the fourth column --
Joseph Shebroe: Uh-huh.
Mr. Nicola: -- the number 926, is that a telephone call item number?
Joseph Shebroe: It's actually 936.
Mr. Nicola: Okay.
Joseph Shebroe: But, yeah. Yes, it is.
Mr. Nicola: Could you just read for us what, going from left to right, what these columns mean?
Joseph Shebroe: Sure. Item No. 936, the date the call was placed was February 1st at 12:16 a.m. The “O” under “Rate Period” is for off peak, meaning a night or a weekend. “Call Origination” is Miami, Florida. Then the phone number that was called. Would you like me to read the number?
Mr. Nicola: No. We can see it.
Joseph Shebroe: Okay. The phone -- the location of that phone number is Beverly Hills, California. The duration was ten minutes. It was placed on a weekend. The “Home Air Time Charges Included”, that's basically in relation to the calling plan that was chosen. And then the two charges on the right are both zero.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. So the first geographical location is where the call was placed from?
Joseph Shebroe: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: And the second geographical location is where the phone number is registered to?
Joseph Shebroe: That's correct.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Could you explain what the -- the codes beginning with “W”, “RMW” and “CW” mean?
Joseph Shebroe: Sure. The “RMW” is a voice mail retrieval. You can also tell that just to the left of that, where it says “Voice Mail”. That's another way. And the “C” -- the “W” under the “CW” is the weekend. The “C” I'm not exactly 100 percent sure of.
Mr. Nicola: Is there a legend in the phone bill that would assist you?
Joseph Shebroe: Yeah. There should be. There is. It's call waiting.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Do you find that on page 34 of 35 on the February 7th, 2003, bill?
Joseph Shebroe: 34 of 35, yeah.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Is that what you're looking at?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes, sir.
Mr. Nicola: Is there a three-way calling feature with Verizon Wireless?
Joseph Shebroe: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Is that encoded somewhere on this legend, or does that have a separate --
Joseph Shebroe: It would have a separate, but it's not on the legend that you have up there, though.
Mr. Nicola: What is the code for three-way calling?
Joseph Shebroe: I'm not sure.
Mr. Nicola: Can you find that for us? I think we're going to probably take a break here in a couple of minutes.
Joseph Shebroe: Okay. Thank you.
Mr. Nicola: Go ahead, if you can look through the record. If you'd like, we'll move on to something else, and during the break you can find that code for us, okay?
Joseph Shebroe: Okay.
The Court: We'll take a break.
Mr. Nicola: Now?
The Court: We'll go ahead and take a break.
Mr. Nicola: Thank you, Judge.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: Go ahead, Counsel.
Mr. Nicola: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Nicola: Mr. Shebroe, just prior to the break, I asked you if you knew what the code was for the three-way calling off the top of your head. Did you find your cheat sheet to help you?
Joseph Shebroe: Yeah.
Mr. Nicola: What is the code for three-way calling?
Joseph Shebroe: The code letter “O”.
Mr. Nicola: Is there a code for call forwarding?
Joseph Shebroe: For call forwarding? The letter “F”.
Mr. Nicola: I believe that's all I have.
The Court: Mr. Sanger?
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Mr. Shebroe, how're you doing?
Joseph Shebroe: Good. How are you?
Mr. Sanger: I'm fine. All of these phones are cell phones; is that correct?
Joseph Shebroe: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. No further questions. (Laughter.)
The Court: But you couldn't say, “No questions”, could you? (Laughter.)
The Court: You came that close.
Mr. Nicola: May the witness be excused, Your Honor?
The Court: You may. You may step down. Just so the jury knows, the short delay, our court reporter is still having problems with her computer, so in case nobody told you that, that's why we're having some lengthened recesses. It's not because I care about your recesses. Call your next witness.
Mr. Nicola: Here she is. Jeanne Mulcahy.
The Court: Please remain standing. Face the clerk and raise your right hand.
Message: JEANNE MULCAHY Having been sworn, testified as follows:
Jeanne Mulcahy: I do.
The Clerk: Please be seated. State and spell your name for the record.
Jeanne Mulcahy: Jeanne Mulcahy. J-e-a-n-n-e, M--u-l-c-a-h-y.
The Clerk: Thank you.
Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. NICOLA:
Mr. Nicola: Good afternoon, ma'am. And which phone company are you here to testify about?
Jeanne Mulcahy: I'm with Cingular Wireless, and we also acquired AT&T Wireless, so both companies.
Mr. Nicola: You purchased that with cash, right?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Because two seconds equals one minute?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Sure. Yes.
Mr. Nicola: I placed in front of you Exhibit No. 53 and Exhibit No. -- excuse me, 453 and 454?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Uh-huh.
Mr. Nicola: Have you been through those two exhibits prior to coming to court today?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes, I have.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And what is Exhibit 453, please?
Jeanne Mulcahy: They're the records that were requested from AT&T Wireless.
Mr. Nicola: Pursuant to search warrant?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes, sir.
Mr. Nicola: Have you been through the contents of Exhibit 453 to check it for accuracy?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes, sir.
Mr. Nicola: Within Exhibit 453, Tab No. 3, do we find the billing information, the bill, for one Paul Hugo?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And within Exhibit 453, Tab 4, do we find the billing information for MJJ Productions, Miko Brando?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And under Tab 5, is the account information there for Rudy Provencio?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Under Tab 6, is there subscriber information for MJJ Productions/Paul Hugo and Rudy Provencio?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And under Tab 7, those -- are those records for tolls of MJJ Productions/Miko Brando?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And under Tab 9, do we find some billing and financially labeled party information for the following people or entities: MJJ Productions/Miko Brando?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: MJJ Productions with five telephone numbers associated?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And three entries for one Evvy Tavasci with telephone numbers ending in 8984, 4676 and 9111?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Are the records contained within Exhibit 453 kept in the normal course of business?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes, they are.
Mr. Nicola: Are the entries within Exhibit 453 made at or near the time of the events they purport to record?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And does AT&T Wireless rely on these documents in the performance of their business?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: With respect to Exhibit 454, are the documents contained within 454 Cingular Wireless records?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And are they records for the following two individuals, Ann Kite under Tab No. 1?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Evvy Tavasci at Tab No. 2?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Now, prior to the merger of AT&T and Cingular -- well, excuse me, one bought the other, right?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Which agency did you work with?
Jeanne Mulcahy: AT&T Wireless.
Mr. Nicola: AT&T Wireless, okay. Are you familiar with the Cingular Wireless records?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes, I am.
Mr. Nicola: And their billing cycle?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And is it with respect to that knowledge that you come here and testify as a custodian of the records that have the Cingular label on them?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes, sir.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Are these records also kept within the normal course and scope of the business of AT&T Wireless/Cingular?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And with respect to the documents in 454, are they recorded at or near the time of the events?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And does Cingular/AT&T rely on these documents in the regular course of their business?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Your Honor, at this time we would offer 453 and 454 into evidence.
Mr. Sanger: Same request, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. They're admitted with the same provision.
Mr. Nicola: If you could please turn to Exhibit 454, Tab No. 1, and what appears to be labeled “Field Usage” for one Ann Kite. May I have the Elmo, please, Your Honor? I'm just going to lay this on the projector.
Mr. Sanger: I think you have to open it.
Mr. Nicola: I keep thinking it's a copy machine.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Can you just give us an example of how you would read this bill across, from left to right, please, top line?
Jeanne Mulcahy: The first area is the number; and then the electronic serial number; rate plan; an abbreviation of the amount; called locations; description, whether it's incoming, or the number that was dialed if it was outbound; the date; the time; duration; and charges; and the roamer system that was being used to processed calls.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Do you know what the codes are for three-way calling if they're available for these mobile phones?
Jeanne Mulcahy: I believe it's usually 3 -- 3W.
Mr. Nicola: 3W; three-way?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Makes more sense than an “O”, right?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: I'd like you to turn to Exhibit 453, please. I'd like to show you a different format bill. Why don't you turn to page one of the Paul Hugo account under Tab 3. I'll lay this on the Elmo. And these records appear to be in a different format, correct?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: Could you explain to us, please, just starting at Item No. 1, what the columns mean across?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Sure. It's the date; the time of the call; the number called; the general area that the call was placed to; quantity of minutes; the rate that was charged; and just the charge description.
Mr. Nicola: And the calling plan?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Uh-huh, yes.
Mr. Nicola: Is the code for a three-way call on this bill also “3W”, or is that different?
Jeanne Mulcahy: I believe so.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Could you please turn to the next page on the Paul Hugo exhibit?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Are there sections of your bills which indicate where a party may be while they're placing phone calls using these wireless phones?
Jeanne Mulcahy: I don't believe on this bill.
Mr. Nicola: Are you looking at what I'm looking at?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Oh, I'm sorry. Under the “Roamer Usage”, yes, that's the detail of when you're roaming. Sorry.
Mr. Nicola: Okay, I'm going to guess this means the phone was in Brazil.
Jeanne Mulcahy: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: And on Item No. 2, does that entry mean that while in Brazil, this number called, on March 2nd at 6:05 p.m., the phone number (201) 233-0063?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. If I could show you just one more format bill. Please turn to Tab 4. And is that the service information and toll record for MJJ Productions, Service User Miko Brando?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: If you could turn to what is marked as page 48. I believe it's the first page in that exhibit.
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And yet another way to track phone calls. Is that in the same format, just spaced differently?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes, it's the same format.
Mr. Nicola: And is the first group of numbers the phone number of the user?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. And then the fourth column in from the left, or, actually, the next phone number you would see would be the number dialed, correct?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Yes.
Mr. Nicola: And then the date and the time entry in the middle of this bill now, right?
Jeanne Mulcahy: Correct.
Mr. Nicola: Okay. Thank you, Miss Mulcahy. Your Honor, I have no further questions.
The Court: Counsel?
Mr. Sanger: No questions. (Laughter.)
The Court: Doesn't get any better than that. (Laughter.)
The Court: Call in your next witness. Thank you. You're excused.
Mr. Zonen: Call Deborah Rowe to the stand.
The Court: Come to the witness stand, please. When you get to the witness stand, please raise your right hand, face the clerk.
Message: DEBORAH ROWE JACKSON Having been sworn, testified as follows:
Debbie Rowe: Yes, I do.
The Clerk: Please be seated. State and spell your name for the record.
Debbie Rowe: Deborah, D-e-b-o-r-a-h; Rowe, R-o-w-e; Jackson, J-a-c-k-s-o-n.
The Clerk: Thank you.
Mr. Zonen: May I proceed?
The Court: You may.
Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: Do you refer to be called Miss Rowe?
Debbie Rowe: Debbie, please.
Mr. Zonen: All right. But in court, we're a little more formal.
Debbie Rowe: Oh.
Mr. Zonen: In terms of surnames, do you go by Miss Rowe?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know the defendant, Michael Jackson, seated to my right with the long, dark hair?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, I do.
Mr. Zonen: How do you know Mr. Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: We've been friends and we were married.
Mr. Zonen: When were you married to Mr. Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: From 1997 to 1999.
Mr. Zonen: All right. We've --
Debbie Rowe: Sorry.
Mr. Zonen: The acoustics are not quite what they could be in this courtroom, so you have to stay close to the microphone and keep your voice up. Is that all right?
Debbie Rowe: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: All right. You were married to Mr. Jackson between which periods of time again, please?
Debbie Rowe: I believe 1997 to 1999.
Mr. Zonen: For what period of time did you know Mr. Jackson prior to that?
Debbie Rowe: Probably 20 years or more.
Mr. Zonen: Were you friends with Mr. Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Are you the mother of his two children?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, I am.
Mr. Zonen: The two oldest children?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, I am.
Mr. Zonen: And their names are what?
Debbie Rowe: Michael Joseph Jackson, Jr., and Paris Michael Katherine Jackson.
Mr. Zonen: And when were you divorced from Mr. Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: October -- I believe October 1999.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have -- did you ever live with Mr. Jackson during the course of your marriage?
Debbie Rowe: We never shared a home.
Mr. Zonen: Did you live with Mr. Jackson prior to that marriage?
Debbie Rowe: We never shared an apartment.
Mr. Zonen: At the time that the marriage was dissolved, was there an understanding or an agreement as to child custody?
Debbie Rowe: I'm sorry?
Mr. Zonen: Was there an understanding or agreement as to child custody?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And who had custody of the two children?
Debbie Rowe: Michael did.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have visitation of the two children?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: And what was the extent of the visitation as determined by that divorce?
Debbie Rowe: Every 45 days for eight hours.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you, in fact, see the two children every 45 days for eight hours?
Debbie Rowe: I tried.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Were there difficulties in being able to do so?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What kinds of difficulties?
Debbie Rowe: There were times that the children and Michael would be out of the country, and I was working at the time, and if they were in South Africa, I would not have enough time to fly to where they were and then return home in time to be at work.
Mr. Zonen: Were you able to make up that eight-hour period when they returned?
Debbie Rowe: No. It was pushed off until the next 45 days.
Mr. Zonen: For what period of time did that continue, that custody arrangement?
Debbie Rowe: I believe a year and a half.
Mr. Zonen: At some point in time did you voluntarily agree to give up parental rights as to those two children?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And when was that, can you tell us?
Debbie Rowe: I believe 2001.
Mr. Zonen: And why did you do that?
Debbie Rowe: The visitations were not comfortable. We were hooked up at a hotel. I was -- when I would bring things to do, finger-painting, coloring or whatever, the nanny was always very concerned with the children getting dirty. I would bring T-shirts or something to put over their clothes, and the environment was very sterile. It wasn't a quality relationship.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ask to have more time with the kids?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. The answer was, “Yes”.
Debbie Rowe: I'm sorry.
The Court: Next question. That's all right.
Mr. Zonen: And was that request granted?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: And tell me why you made the decision to give up parental rights as to the two children at that time.
Debbie Rowe: I didn't believe that --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Relevance; opinion.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: At some point in time -- when was the last time that you saw the two children?
Debbie Rowe: Two and a half, three years ago. I'm not sure. I don't remember the dates.
Mr. Zonen: Did you receive a call from anybody in the early part of February of 2003 requesting your assistance on behalf of Michael Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Debbie Rowe: I'm sorry.
The Court: Overruled. You may -- it's answered, “Yes”. Next question.
Mr. Zonen: From whom was that telephone call?
Debbie Rowe: Originally --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Zonen: I asked who it was.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer as to who it was.
Debbie Rowe: Originally my former boss's partner called me and said that I needed to call my old boss; that he needed to speak with me; that Michael needed my help with something.
Mr. Zonen: Who was the old boss you're referring to?
Debbie Rowe: Arnold Klein.
Mr. Zonen: What kind of work was that that you were doing for Mr. Klein?
Debbie Rowe: He's a dermatologist. I was an assistant for him.
Mr. Zonen: For what period of time were you his assistant?
Debbie Rowe: From 1979 to 2000 or 2001.
Mr. Zonen: What kind of work did you do for Mr. -- Dr. Klein?
Debbie Rowe: I assisted him with surgeries and patients.
Mr. Zonen: Without getting into the content of that telephone call, did you, in fact, call Dr. Klein?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: And did you have a conversation with him?
Debbie Rowe: Very brief.
Mr. Zonen: Did that conversation lead to a conversation with yet another person?
Debbie Rowe: Yes. He wanted me to speak with Marc Schaffel.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Move to strike.
The Court: Stricken.
Mr. Zonen: That conversation led to a conversation with yet another person; is that correct?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, it is.
Mr. Zonen: Who was that person with whom you then had a conversation?
Debbie Rowe: Marc Schaffel.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know Marc Schaffel?
Debbie Rowe: Not before this conversation.
Mr. Zonen: Was that the first time you had ever spoken with Mr. Schaffel?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Prior to that conversation, did you know who he was?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Had you -- had you ever heard his name prior to that day?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you, in fact, call Marc Schaffel?
Debbie Rowe: The call was placed between Dr. Klein and myself.
Mr. Zonen: All right.
Debbie Rowe: I don't hand out my phone number.
Mr. Zonen: Ultimately, Marc Schaffel contacted you, or Dr. Klein arranged the conversation? How was that?
Debbie Rowe: Correct. Dr. Klein arranged the conversation. I did not feel comfortable with a three-way, and told Mr. Schaffel that I would call him if he gave me his number.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did Mr. Schaffel, in fact, have a conversation with you?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, he did.
Mr. Zonen: Do you recall when that conversation took place?
Debbie Rowe: It was early in February, in the morning.
Mr. Zonen: And what was the nature of that conversation?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection, hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Would you tell us if -- prior to that conversation, were you aware of a documentary that was titled, “Living with Michael Jackson”?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were you aware of a person by the name of Martin Bashir?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: As a consequence of this conversation with Marc Schaffel, did you then have a conversation with the defendant?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And how long after your conversation with Mr. Schaffel was your conversation with Michael Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: Probably 30 minutes.
Mr. Zonen: Who called who?
Debbie Rowe: They called me back, because they could not get ahold of Michael immediately.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Nonresponsive; hearsay; move to strike.
The Court: Nonresponsive. Who called who is the question?
Mr. Zonen: Right.
The Court: I'll strike the answer.
Mr. Zonen: Were you contacted by somebody with regards --
Debbie Rowe: Marc Schaffel, yes.
Mr. Zonen: Marc Schaffel called you?
Debbie Rowe: And Ronald Konitzer.
Mr. Zonen: You then had a conversation with Ronald Konitzer as well?
Debbie Rowe: For a brief moment. Michael was with him.
Mr. Zonen: Did Michael Jackson then get on the telephone?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, he did.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Zonen: What did Mr. Jackson say to you in the course of this conversation?
Debbie Rowe: He told me there was a video coming out, and it was full of lies, and would I help. And I said, as always, yes. I asked him if he was okay. I was very upset.
Mr. Zonen: When was the last time you had talked with Michael Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: The day of our divorce.
Mr. Zonen: And how long prior to that, to this conversation you're now referring to, was that day of your divorce?
Debbie Rowe: October 12th.
Mr. Zonen: Of what year, please?
Debbie Rowe: .99.
Mr. Zonen: All right. So we're now talking about February of 2003; is that correct?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Now, he asked you for some kind of assistance; is that correct?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What exactly did he ask you to do, if anything?
Debbie Rowe: He asked if I would work with Ronald and Dieter to help him, and I said yes. And I asked him how he was. I asked him how the children were. And I asked if I could see them when everything settled down.
Mr. Zonen: What did he tell you?
Debbie Rowe: He said yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Had you had any communication with Mr. Jackson in the preceding period of time with regards to the children?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Had you sent any letters to him at all requesting that you be able to see them at some point in time?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you want to see the children?
Debbie Rowe: Very much.
Mr. Zonen: All right. The conversation that you had with Mr. Jackson over the telephone, did he tell you from where he was calling?
Debbie Rowe: No. I was told by Marc that they had to call Europe.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay; nonresponsive; move to strike.
The Court: It's nonresponsive. Stricken.
Mr. Zonen: You had mentioned that Ronald Konitzer had called back; is that correct? Did I get that right?
Debbie Rowe: Marc Schaffel called me back. Ronald had called Marc, or Marc had called Ronald. I don't know who placed that call.
Mr. Zonen: At some point in time you actually spoke with Ronald Konitzer?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know Mr. Konitzer prior to that day?
Debbie Rowe: I think I met him years ago when Michael was on tour. I don't -- he said that I had met him. I didn't remember. I didn't have a face and I didn't recognize the voice.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And did you carry on -- without getting into the content of the conversation, did you, in fact, have a conversation with Mr. Konitzer before your conversation with Michael Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: He just said, “Michael needs your help” --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Nonresponsive; hearsay.
Mr. Zonen: The question is “yes” or “no”.
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
The Court: Sustained.
Debbie Rowe: Sorry.
Mr. Zonen: The conversation that you had with Michael Jackson was approximately how long in length?
Debbie Rowe: Two and a half minutes, maybe.
Mr. Zonen: Were you at home at that time?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, I was.
Mr. Zonen: You said that you had asked him how he was and how the children were?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What did he tell you specifically about the -- whatever it was, the performance that was coming on television or the documentary, how did he describe it to you?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading and assumes facts not in evidence.
The Court: Sustained as to assuming facts.
Mr. Zonen: What did he tell you about what was going to happen?
Debbie Rowe: That there was a bad video coming out. I did not -- he didn't go into any more detail about that.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ask him what it was about?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ask him if it dealt with him personally, Mr. Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: I assumed it did.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Now, he asked you for some assistance; is that correct?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And did he describe to you in any detail or particularity what it was he wanted you to do?
Debbie Rowe: No, he did not.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. Did he tell you to follow anybody's direction?
Debbie Rowe: He asked me --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Debbie Rowe: I'm sorry.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: What did he tell you to do?
Debbie Rowe: He asked me to work with Ronald, Dieter and Marc.
Mr. Zonen: All right. You just told us about Ronald. Is Dieter somebody you knew prior to that day?
Debbie Rowe: I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know Dieter's last name?
Debbie Rowe: Weizner or Weizer.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. And you don't recall at this time whether you had ever met him prior to that date, the time of that phone call?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Now, did you ask any directions as to how you were going to work with him or what you were going to do?
Debbie Rowe: I told them that I needed a release of confidentiality, and that until that was done, I wouldn't be able to do anything.
Mr. Zonen: You told Mr. Jackson that?
Debbie Rowe: No, I'm sorry, I told Marc Schaffel, Dieter and Ronald.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Let's go back to the conversation again with Mr. Jackson --
Debbie Rowe: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: -- before you hung up the phone or before your telephone conversation ended. You said specifically about the children. Tell me what it was that he told you about the children with regards to visitation.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; asked and answered.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Zonen: Go ahead.
Debbie Rowe: When -- when -- I said, “Are you” -- “Are you okay? Are the children okay?” And he said, “Yeah, we're okay”. And I said, “Can I see you when everything -- and the children when everything is over with?” And he said, “Yes”.
Mr. Zonen: Did you want to see Mr. Jackson and the children?
Debbie Rowe: Absolutely.
Mr. Zonen: Did he give you any other direction as to when that might be?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did that conversation end at that time, or was there anything else that you discussed in the course of that conversation?
Debbie Rowe: Michael and I?
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Debbie Rowe: No, we didn't discuss anything else. The phone was handed back to Ronald.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Your conversation then continued with Ronald?
Debbie Rowe: Correct.
Mr. Zonen: All right. What was asked of you at that point by Ronald?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Zonen: As explaining her conduct thereafter, not for the truth of the matter.
The Court: All right. I'll allow the hearsay for that limited purpose.
Mr. Zonen: What was explained by Ronald thereafter?
Debbie Rowe: That they were going to do a special - I don't know if they used the word “rebuttal” - to counter whatever this video was.
Mr. Zonen: And what was asked of you?
Debbie Rowe: Would I help.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; assumes facts not in evidence.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: And leading.
Mr. Zonen: Was anything said by Mr. Weizner as to your involvement?
Debbie Rowe: What -- I don't understand. What do you mean by that?
Mr. Zonen: Well, in the telephone call that continued -- maybe I'm confused. Was it Konitzer or was it Weizner?
Debbie Rowe: Konitzer.
Mr. Zonen: It was Konitzer, all right. Ronald Konitzer. What exactly was it that Mr. Konitzer then said to you about what you were supposed to do?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Debbie Rowe: To --
Mr. Mesereau: Assumes facts not in evidence.
Mr. Zonen: Again, to explain --
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Was there a conversation with Mr. Konitzer at that point about anything that you were then going to do?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Zonen: That was overruled?
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Go ahead and answer.
Debbie Rowe: What was the question? I'm sorry.
The Court: I'll have the court reporter read it back to you.
Debbie Rowe: Thank you.
The Court Reporter: Was there a conversation with Mr. Konitzer at that point about anything that you were then going to do?
Debbie Rowe: I was supposed to work with Marc Schaffel, and that was when I told them that we had to have the paperwork done --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; nonresponsive.
The Court: The second part of the answer I'll strike. Leave the first part in.
Mr. Zonen: All right. With regards to working with Marc Schaffel, was there any other statement that was given to you by Mr. Konitzer at that time?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Mr. Zonen: Hardly suggests the answer.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Debbie Rowe: That I would be working with Marc on whatever project that had been decided.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you, in fact, then have a conversation with Marc?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: When did that conversation take place? Marc Schaffel.
Debbie Rowe: After the connection was broken between Michael and Ronald and myself.
Mr. Zonen: That same day?
Debbie Rowe: It was the same conversation. Marc had us on two lines. So when he hung up the one line, Marc and I were still on another line.
Mr. Zonen: Was Marc Schaffel part of the conversation that you had with -- in other words, was it a conference call between Marc and you and Ronald Konitzer?
Debbie Rowe: Correct.
Mr. Zonen: So he was privy to the conversation that was taking place at that point?
Debbie Rowe: He set it up.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Was he part of the conversation while you were talking with Mr. Konitzer? In other words, did he periodically say things as well?
Debbie Rowe: I don't remember.
Mr. Zonen: What did Mr. Schaffel want you to do?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Hearsay; assumes facts not in evidence.
Mr. Zonen: Same exception.
The Court: Foundation, sustained.
Mr. Zonen: In the course of this conversation, did Mr. Schaffel make requests of you?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Debbie Rowe: Nothing specific. I couldn't discuss anything at that point.
Mr. Zonen: Did you advise him that you needed to do something?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And what was that?
Debbie Rowe: We needed to agree on a confidentiality release between Michael and myself.
Mr. Zonen: Was there such an agreement that you had between you and the defendant?
Debbie Rowe: Eventually.
Mr. Zonen: Well, prior to this conversation, was there some kind of a confidentiality contract that you had with Mr. Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And when did you and Mr. Jackson enter into that agreement?
Debbie Rowe: At the time of our divorce.
Mr. Zonen: And did that restrain you from having conversations with people about something or other? What did it restrain you from doing, this confidentiality agreement?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; leading; relevance.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know what the confidentiality agreement was? Have you ever read it?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And you read it at or about the time that you entered into this divorce with Mr. Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did that confidentiality agreement keep you from doing something?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, it did.
Mr. Zonen: What did it keep you from doing?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; leading; relevance.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Mesereau: 352.
Mr. Zonen: Go ahead and answer the question.
Debbie Rowe: The confidentiality agreement said that I could not speak with the press, public, anyone, regarding Michael or the children or our lives together.
Mr. Zonen: Were you able to get an exemption from that agreement?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have an attorney working on that?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What is your attorney's name?
Debbie Rowe: Iris Joan Finsilver, F, as in Frank, i-n-s-i-l-v-e-r.
Mr. Zonen: Has Miss Finsilver been your attorney for some time?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did she represent you in your divorce with Mr. Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, she did.
Mr. Zonen: Ultimately when that exemption was executed, were you then able to speak with Mr. Schaffel about what you were expected to do?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And what was it that you were expected to do?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you have a conversation with Mr. Schaffel after the execution of this exemption?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. In the course of that conversation, were you told things by Mr. Schaffel with regards to doing something on behalf of Michael Jackson?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: What did Mr. Schaffel tell you in this conversation?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Zonen: For the same exception.
The Court: All right. Overruled.
Mr. Zonen: Go ahead.
Debbie Rowe: That we would be doing an interview.
Mr. Zonen: Did he tell you where or when?
Debbie Rowe: He said that it would probably be at his home in Calabasas and within two or three days of when everything was settled.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Now, when was it exactly that you had this conversation with Mr. Schaffel about doing the interview relative to this first phone call from Mr. Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: Do you mean when we were going to do it? Or when we scheduled it?
Mr. Zonen: When you scheduled it.
Debbie Rowe: We didn't schedule it till after the documents had been signed.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. And how long did that take before you were able to create and sign documents?
Debbie Rowe: I would like to say that it was probably only two days. It seemed a lot longer. There was a lot of faxing back and forth.
Mr. Zonen: Was there some urgency in doing it soon?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Did anybody ask you to do it at a particular time?
Debbie Rowe: Mr. Schaffel.
Mr. Zonen: What did he say with regards to that?
Debbie Rowe: As soon as he could arrange --
Mr. Mesereau: Hearsay.
Mr. Zonen: Same exception.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Debbie Rowe: As soon as he could arrange to have whatever he needed, I believe, for the interview.
Mr. Zonen: And was there a date finally set for the interview?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know what that date was?
Debbie Rowe: I don't know exactly. Beginning of February, I believe.
Mr. Zonen: Are you aware as to when or if the screening of “Living with Michael Jackson” ever actually aired in the United States?
Debbie Rowe: I know that it aired. I don't know when it aired. I didn't watch it.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know when, relative to the airing of that production, your interview took place?
Debbie Rowe: I know in relation to when it took place in Europe, but not here.
Mr. Zonen: When did it take place relative to the European airing?
Debbie Rowe: The day before I gave my interview.
Mr. Zonen: Did that interview take place at Mr. Schaffel's residence?
Debbie Rowe: My interview?
Mr. Zonen: Yes, your interview.
Debbie Rowe: Yes, it did.
Mr. Zonen: Can you tell us who was present during that interview?
Debbie Rowe: Hamid, who is Michael's photographer; Rudy; Christian; Marc; Stuart Backerman, who I think was Michael's PR person; and Iris came with me.
Mr. Zonen: Up until the time that you arrived at Mr. Schaffel's home to do this, had Mr. Schaffel told you that you would get any benefit from doing this interview?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading and hearsay.
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry?
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Were you going to be paid for this interview?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were any promises made at all?
Debbie Rowe: Just that I --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading and hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: And vague.
The Court: Hearsay, sustained. Hearsay.
Mr. Zonen: On hearsay. We would offer it again as to tending to explain her actions and her response, and not for the truth of the matter stated.
The Court: The objection's sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Did anybody offer you anything in response to your doing this?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Debbie Rowe: Do you mean quid pro quo?
Mr. Zonen: Yes.
Debbie Rowe: No, I was excited to see Michael and the children when all this was over.
Mr. Zonen: Why did you do this interview?
Debbie Rowe: I promised him that I would always be there for him and the children.
Mr. Zonen: Did anybody mention your children in the course of either doing this interview or leading up to the interview?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Asked and answered and leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Zonen: You can answer that question.
Debbie Rowe: Can you explain what you mean?
Mr. Zonen: Did anybody mention anything about your children with regards to -- relative to this interview --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection.
Mr. Zonen: -- leading up to the interview or during the course of the interview?
Mr. Mesereau: Vague; compound; and leading and foundation.
The Court: Rephrase. It's an extended question now.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Specifically, you had conversations with Mr. Schaffel, did you not --
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: -- prior to the interview?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have a number of conversations prior to the interview?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: How many conversations did you have with him prior to the interview?
Debbie Rowe: One to set up the day and time, and one for directions on how to get to his house.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Prior to actually arriving at his house, did he talk to you about your children at all?
Debbie Rowe: He said the kids were fine; that Michael was going to be okay.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did he make any representations to you about visitation?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; foundation; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Debbie Rowe: When I expressed excitement for seeing the children and for seeing Michael again and possibly reconnecting, he seemed to be very happy.
Mr. Zonen: All right. During the course of your being at the house conducting this interview, did you talk with Mr. Schaffel any further about your children?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. What did he say with regards to your children while you were at his house?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
Mr. Zonen: Same exception. I will add also it's a statement in furtherance.
The Court: I reject that as a reason, but let me look. All right. I'll allow the question for the limited purpose of explaining her action after that. Do you want the question read back?
Debbie Rowe: I can't see that far, yes, please.
The Court: Okay.
The Court Reporter: All right. What did he say with regards to your children while you were at his house?
Debbie Rowe: That they were fine; that Michael was going to be okay; that it was -- he was happy for me that we were all going to get to see each other again, and how big the kids have gotten, and how beautiful they were, and how strong-headed Paris is and -- about like me.
Mr. Zonen: What was your expectation with regards to your children in terms of your completing this interview?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; foundation.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have any expectations with regard to your kids at all?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What was that? What were your expectations?
Debbie Rowe: To be reintroduced to them and to be reacquainted with their dad.
Mr. Zonen: You wanted to be reacquainted with Mr. Jackson as well?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Why?
Debbie Rowe: He's my friend.
Mr. Zonen: Let me ask you about the interview. For what period of time were you at Mr. Schaffel's home?
Debbie Rowe: I was at his house about ten and a half hours, but the taping was about nine.
Mr. Zonen: Was your attorney with you?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: The entire time?
Debbie Rowe: She stayed downstairs when Ian Drew arrived. And I was concerned about someone being able to say that --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Nonresponsive and hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: The question was whether or not she was there the entire time. Was there a period of time --
Debbie Rowe: She was in the house.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. She was in the house, but at some times not with you?
Debbie Rowe: Correct.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Now, prior to the start of this interview, had you talked with anybody about the content of this interview, in other words, what was going to be asked of you?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence, leading and foundation.
The Court: Overruled. Do you want the question read back?
Debbie Rowe: No. No, I did not want that.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know what it was you were going to be saying?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know what it was -- the questions, what questions would be asked of you?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know whether or not it had anything to do with this video or this television show?
Debbie Rowe: All I knew, it was whatever was being put out about Michael could be hurtful to him and the children, and I don't know if I was supposed to run interference. I don't know what the basis was for my interview.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ask him about the content of the television show?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you ask anybody about the content of the questions that would be put to you?
Debbie Rowe: Absolutely not.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know that it would be questions put to you? In other words, it would be in the format of an interview?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Who had told you that?
Debbie Rowe: Mr. Schaffel.
Mr. Zonen: Who was present at the time when this interview commenced?
Debbie Rowe: Iris. Stuart. Rudy. Christian was in and out. It was either Christian or Rudy that was in and out. Marc. Myself. And Ian Drew.
Mr. Zonen: Iris is Iris Finsilver, your attorney?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Stuart is who?
Debbie Rowe: Stuart Backerman, I was told, was a spokesperson for Michael.
Mr. Zonen: Had you ever seen Mr. Backerman prior to that day?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Had you ever heard his name prior to that day?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Were you introduced to him that day?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you actually have a conversation with him?
Debbie Rowe: Nothing other than, “Nice to meet you”, and very casual. Nothing important to say.
Mr. Zonen: You said Rudy. Who is Rudy?
Debbie Rowe: He was Marc's go-fer boy.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; foundation.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Zonen: Marc's -- say that again?
Debbie Rowe: Go-fer boy.
Mr. Zonen: Go-fer? Somebody who did things for Mr. Schaffel?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know Rudy's last name?
Debbie Rowe: No, I don't. I'm sorry.
Mr. Zonen: Do you recall if you were told his last name at any time?
Debbie Rowe: No, I was -- I was introduced to everyone on a first-name basis. I knew Hamid from before.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Rudy was or was not somebody you knew prior to that day?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Christian, if I'm reading my handwriting correctly --
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: -- was the name you mentioned?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was Christian somebody you knew prior to that day?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Was his name given to you at that time?
Debbie Rowe: I don't remember if I was introduced to him or if someone had said, “Christian will get it”. I knew it was his name, because -- I don't remember being formally introduced to him.
Mr. Zonen: All right. You don't recall an acquaintance with him prior to that day?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: You mentioned Ian Drew.
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Who is Ian Drew?
Debbie Rowe: He was someone that was going to interview me.
Mr. Zonen: And was he somebody you knew prior to that day as well?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have any preliminary conversation with him prior to the commencement of this interview?
Debbie Rowe: Absolutely not.
Mr. Zonen: Was that by your choice?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And why is that? Why was that?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; 352; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Zonen: Go ahead.
Debbie Rowe: Because I didn't want anyone to be able to come back to me and say that my interview was rehearsed, that someone told me what to say. Mr. Jackson knows no one can tell me what to say. I tend to speak my own mind, and I didn't want the interview to be construed as something other than what it was, which was a cold interview.
Mr. Zonen: At some point in time, were you given any kind of a list of questions?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection.
The Court: Overruled.
Debbie Rowe: It was offered to me and I declined it.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Who offered you the list?
Debbie Rowe: Ian Drew.
Mr. Zonen: Why did you decline it?
Debbie Rowe: Again, it was a cold interview, and I wanted to keep it that way.
Mr. Zonen: Was anyone else in the room during the course of the interview?
Debbie Rowe: Everyone was. Rudy and Christian were in and out, but the main people who were there was Hamid, Iris, Stuart, Marc and myself.
Mr. Zonen: All right.
Debbie Rowe: And Ian.
Mr. Zonen: Did you know Hamid prior to that?
Debbie Rowe: Yeah, I did.
Mr. Zonen: Was that Hamid Moslehi?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And you recognized him when you got there?
Debbie Rowe: Oh, yes.
Mr. Zonen: He had been Mr. Jackson's videographer for some time?
Debbie Rowe: Yeah, for a long, long time.
Mr. Zonen: Was the location of this interview in Calabasas, California?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Do you happen to know the date?
Debbie Rowe: It was the day before that documentary was to air. I don't know the date.
Mr. Zonen: Miss Rowe, in the course of the interview that took place, I think you said over about the next nine hours --
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: -- were you truthful in the answers that you gave?
Debbie Rowe: Can you rephrase that?
Mr. Zonen: Did you tell the truth? Did you answer all those questions truthfully and honestly?
Debbie Rowe: No.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Why is that?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Foundation; opinion; relevance.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Mr. Zonen: Why is that?
Debbie Rowe: Because my personal life is my personal life and no one's business. And it pretty much doesn't matter. I could call something black. In the media, it will be called white.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember the questions that you were asked?
Debbie Rowe: Not all of them.
Mr. Zonen: Do you remember some of the questions that you were asked?
Debbie Rowe: I would have to see the tape again.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have an opportunity to review the tape recently?
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. How many hours of tape did you review?
Debbie Rowe: To scan over? It was probably two and a half hours of it, but I wasn't really paying attention. I found myself very boring and dull.
Mr. Zonen: Do you mean as the subject matter of the tape?
Debbie Rowe: Yeah.
Mr. Zonen: It went for, I think you said, about two and a half hours?
Debbie Rowe: That I -- that I saw, I think it was a three-hour tape, but I didn't watch the entire video.
Mr. Zonen: Do you have a belief as to whether or not it was an edited version of what had taken place?
Debbie Rowe: It had to be. It was a nine-hour interview. And if there's only three hours, there's six hours someplace.
Mr. Zonen: Were you asked questions about Mr. Jackson?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, I was.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; hearsay.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Zonen: What questions that were asked of you about Mr. Jackson did you not give honest answers to?
Debbie Rowe: Can you be more specific?
Mr. Zonen: I can. Did he ask -- were you asked questions about Mr. Jackson and his parenting of your two children?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. Leading; move to strike.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Zonen: Did you understand the question? Would you like to hear it again?
Debbie Rowe: Yes, I was asked the question.
Mr. Zonen: May the court reporter repeat the question, Your Honor?
The Court: I think she understood the --
Debbie Rowe: I understood the question, and I said, “Yes”.
Mr. Zonen: Oh, I'm sorry.
The Court: She answered your question.
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry.
Mr. Zonen: Were those the questions, or among the questions, that you did not answer honestly?
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
The Court: Overruled. You may answer.
Debbie Rowe: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: When was the last time you had actually seen Mr. Jackson related to your two oldest children?
Debbie Rowe: The day that we signed our divorce papers.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have any information at all about his parenting skills with your children?
Debbie Rowe: Just -- yes, I did. I -- when I was seeing the children, I spoke with the nannies before we divorced. I saw him with the children. I've seen him with the kids the whole time I've known him.
The Court: Counsel, we'll take our afternoon break. Before we break, I just want to ask you a question, Mr. Sanger.
Mr. Sanger: Yes, sir.
