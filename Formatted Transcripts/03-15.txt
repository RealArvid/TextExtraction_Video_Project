Message: GAVIN-ANTON ARVIZO Having been previously sworn, resumed the stand and testified further as follows:
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION Continued BY MR. MESEREAU:
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Arvizo, when you claim you were inappropriately touched by Mr. Jackson, you claim there were no witnesses watching, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, at some point, do you recall giving a DNA swab to any Santa Barbara Sheriff.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes. They gave me a DNA swab.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately when that was.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever learn what the results were of any DNA testing.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever discuss it with Prosecutor Sneddon.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever discuss it with any other prosecutor.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever discuss it with any sheriff.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: How about any lawyer or paralegal.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever discuss it with any member of your family.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: So as you sit here today, you don't know what the results are of those DNA tests, right.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you indicated that you were upset that there was no press conference in Miami when you and your family traveled to Miami to see Michael Jackson, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: I said it wasn't that big of a deal, because I was already having fun.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you wanted a press conference in this case, didn't you.
Gavin Arvizo: Michael wanted it.
Mr. Mesereau: No --
Gavin Arvizo: Michael told me he wanted it.
Mr. Mesereau: Sir, when you were testifying before the grand jury, you wanted to give a press conference, didn't you.
Gavin Arvizo: No, I thought we were going to have a press conference, because that's what I was told.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling Mr. Sneddon and the grand jury that you wanted to have a press conference.
Gavin Arvizo: I might have said that we wanted to have a press conference, because Michael wanted to.
Mr. Mesereau: Michael wanted to have a press conference when you were in front of the grand jury; is that what you're saying. You can answer the question.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Remember telling Mr. Sneddon, “Oh, man, I was going to have a press conference”.
Mr. Sneddon: Excuse me, Your Honor. Could we have a page reference on that, before Counsel reads it.
Mr. Mesereau: Sure. Sure. It's 449.
Mr. Sneddon: That's fine.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember when you were in front of the Santa Barbara Grand Jury, Mr. Sneddon told you there was an order that you not talk to the media, and your response was, “Oh, man, I was going to have a press conference”. Do you remember that.
Gavin Arvizo: That was probably a joke.
Mr. Mesereau: That was a joke.
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: So you're in front of the Santa Barbara Grand Jury talking about this case and you're telling a joke.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right. Do you know someone who worked at Neverland named Julio Avila.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember that name at all.
Gavin Arvizo: I remember a guy that might have been named Julio, but I forgot his name.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And was he someone who worked around the amusement rides.
Gavin Arvizo: Oh, yes. Well, he -- he was the manager of the whole Neverland, but then they moved him to the amusement park, if we're talking about the same guy.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember anyone complaining about you and Star --
Mr. Sneddon: Object, Your Honor. It's a violation of a 403 ruling.
Mr. Mesereau: I don't think it is.
The Court: I'm not remembering this. Give me another hint.
Mr. Mesereau: It has to do with behavior at Neverland. Nonsexual nature.
The Court: All right. I'll sustain the objection.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall you and your brother Star being picked up by a FOX News reporter at your home.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never happened.
Gavin Arvizo: Well, I have a friend that works for FOX News, but --
Mr. Mesereau: What's your friend's name.
Gavin Arvizo: Barbara.
Mr. Mesereau: Barbara Schroeder.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know her last name.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall being picked up by Barbara Schroeder and taken for a spending spree.
Gavin Arvizo: I remember going to the movies with her and her daughter.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember she and another member of the media treating you and your brother to shopping.
Gavin Arvizo: I have a friend that used to work for FOX that I met at The Laugh Factory, but he works in, like, cell phones or something.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall Barbara Schroeder and another representative of FOX News taking you and Star shopping and paying your bills.
Gavin Arvizo: They weren't representing FOX News to us. They were our friends.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember them taking you shopping and paying your bills; yes or no.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't remember them paying my bills. And I remember going to the movies with them. I don't remember going on shopping sprees.
Mr. Mesereau: Where did you go with them.
Gavin Arvizo: We went to the movies.
Mr. Mesereau: Where.
Gavin Arvizo: Galleria.
Mr. Mesereau: Which galleria.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know. Somewhere in Los -- Hollywood somewhere.
Mr. Mesereau: In Los Angeles, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you're saying they never took you to any store and paid any bill for you.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You mentioned that someone named Gary Hearn had driven you and your family from time to time while you were at Neverland, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, Gary drove us around.
Mr. Mesereau: How many times do you recall Gary Hearn driving you around.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Was it five times. Ten times.
Gavin Arvizo: Well, no, it was less than that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And where do you remember Gary Hearn driving you to.
Gavin Arvizo: I remember he drove us one time from the hospital to Neverland, and once from our apartment to Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember your being in his car and your mother asking to stop so you could buy various things at stores.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Don't recall him ever stopping so anyone in your family could go shopping.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know someone named Andrew Lassak.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you mentioned --
Gavin Arvizo: Lassak. Police officer.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Do you know him.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you meet him.
Gavin Arvizo: He was an LAPD officer that -- I forgot, really, how we met him. I think he was -- I don't know. My mom met him or something, and then he visited us a lot.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know approximately when you first met this LAPD officer, Mr. Lassak.
Gavin Arvizo: After my father left. A few months after my father left, after I finished chemotherapy.
Mr. Mesereau: And he was a friend of your family, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: He used to visit your house, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You spoke to him, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You saw your brother and sister speak to him, didn't you.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you saw your mother speak to him, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall anyone ever complaining to Los Angeles Police Officer Andrew Lassak that anyone was being held against their will.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object to the question as vague as to time frame.
Mr. Mesereau: I'll rephrase it, Your Honor.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Mesereau: During the period you claim you escaped from Neverland three times, do you recall anyone in your family ever complaining to LAPD Officer Andrew Lassak that anyone was being mistreated or held against their will.
Gavin Arvizo: His name is Lassak, and I don't remember anything happening like that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, I think you testified that you used to stay up -- let me rephrase that. You would end up staying up most of the night when you were at Neverland, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Sometimes.
Mr. Mesereau: Not all the time.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Isn't it true that you and your brother would sometimes roam around the main house starting at 7:00 a.m. in the morning.
Gavin Arvizo: The cooks -- the chefs would be in there like 6:30 or 7:00 or something, and then we'd go in there to eat breakfast.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And how often do you remember doing that.
Gavin Arvizo: Every morning when we would eat breakfast.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know someone named Shane Meredith.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never knew an employee named Shane Meredith at Neverland.
Gavin Arvizo: If I did, I don't remember that.
Mr. Mesereau: He caught you with an open bottle of alcohol at Neverland, didn't he, when Michael Jackson wasn't even around.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you talked yesterday about someone named Brett Ratner. Do you remember that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And he was working on a Rush Hour movie, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes, he was the director for both of them.
Mr. Mesereau: And you met Brett Ratner at Neverland one time, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes, he came to Neverland once.
Mr. Mesereau: And you saw him in the library, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Michael and him were in the library, and they told me to go there.
Mr. Mesereau: You saw him in the library with Michael, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: They told me to go in there.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And you sat down next to Michael Jackson, didn't you.
Gavin Arvizo: I sat on the couch. I sat on this red couch and Michael was sitting here on the seat, and Brett Ratner was sitting here also.
Mr. Mesereau: At one point during that meeting, you rested your head on Michael Jackson's shoulder, didn't you.
Gavin Arvizo: No. It was early in the morning, and I was -- we were sitting -- he was sitting on another chair.
Mr. Mesereau: And you asked if you could go with Michael and Brett Ratner to Florida, didn't you.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't remember asking that.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't remember it or you're not sure you did it.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't remember ever asking that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember hearing your mother tell Jesus Salas that she was very concerned about all the media attention.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't remember. I remember my mom would say stuff like that, but -- she didn't really like it, but, I mean, I don't remember if she did say it to Jesus Salas.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you indicated that you would get to the kitchen sometimes early in the morning, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Well, yeah. Me and a bunch of other people, when we wanted to eat breakfast.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you and your brother often would cook for yourselves, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: We wouldn't really cook. We might grab an apple or some ice cream, but we wouldn't cook.
Mr. Mesereau: Ever see your brother Star cook in that kitchen.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember ever telling Chris Tucker that you didn't make any money from the fund-raiser.
Gavin Arvizo: No. Well, what fund-raising.
Mr. Mesereau: Fund-raiser for you at The Laugh Factory.
Gavin Arvizo: No, because we did make money at The Laugh Factory.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. So you never told Chris Tucker, “We didn't make any money from the fund-raiser”.
Gavin Arvizo: Why would I say that when we did. No, I never said that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall yourself asking Chris Tucker for money.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling Chris Tucker that your family was being hounded by the media and could not leave your house.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never said that.
Gavin Arvizo: I might have told them about some media people that were around our house, but, I mean --
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling Chris Tucker the media was hounding your family and there was no place for you people to go.
Gavin Arvizo: No. Because --
Mr. Mesereau: Never said that.
Gavin Arvizo: I might have talked to him about some guy that was holding a camera outside of my house, but, I mean --
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling Chris Tucker that your family had nowhere to go.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember telling Chris Tucker that you knew Michael Jackson was in Miami and you wanted to go see him.
Gavin Arvizo: No. Well, I -- well, the first time I flew in his plane over to Miami, so I don't know if you're trying to talk about that or what.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, before you flew on Chris Tucker's plane to Miami, do you remember telling Chris Tucker that you wanted to go to Florida to see Michael Jackson.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never said that.
Gavin Arvizo: Michael called, and they arranged it so that we can go on Chris's plane.
Mr. Mesereau: But you never told Chris you wanted to go see Michael in Florida, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't remember if I said in those exact words.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know Vernee Watson.
Gavin Arvizo: I kind of remember her name. But --
Mr. Mesereau: She was an acting teacher for you, wasn't she.
Gavin Arvizo: Was she on a show with Will Smith, the Fresh Prince of Bel Air show.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me, I couldn't understand what you said.
Gavin Arvizo: I think I remember who she is, but I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Did she teach you acting at a school owned by Belinda Johnson.
Gavin Arvizo: I went to some -- I mean, I don't know if we're talking about the same Renee Watson.
Mr. Mesereau: Just asking you if you know someone named Vernee Watson.
Gavin Arvizo: I kind of remember her name. But, I mean, I haven't --
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know who she is.
Gavin Arvizo: As I said, I kind of think I do, but I don't know if it's that person -- if that name goes with that face.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, can you please describe the Vernee Watson that you know.
Gavin Arvizo: She has like dreadlocks and she's African-American. And she -- she played Will Smith's mother on Fresh Prince of Bel Air. And -- yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: And how do you know her.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't remember. She's been our friend for a long time.
Mr. Mesereau: Is she still your friend.
Gavin Arvizo: Um, we -- we haven't called her in a while. But I think I met her through a dance company, a dance class -- a dance studio I was with.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall ever asking her for money.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you recall your mother ever asking Vernee Watson for money.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, I think you said yesterday that you did not call Chris Tucker on February 4th, 2003; is that right.
Gavin Arvizo: I said that I don't really remember if I said that or not, but I don't know if I called Chris Tucker on February 4th, 2003.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember calling Chris Tucker before you went to Miami and telling him you're being harassed by the media.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, object as asked and answered.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Did your mother ask you to call Chris Tucker.
Gavin Arvizo: No, I don't think so.
Mr. Mesereau: How did you know Michael Jackson was in Miami.
Gavin Arvizo: Because he called us and told us that he was in Miami.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you call Chris Tucker on a regular basis at that particular time.
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, I was still talking to him.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Did you typically call him from home.
Gavin Arvizo: Sometimes.
Mr. Mesereau: Where else would you call him from.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know. At my grandma's house.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, Chris told you that he was going to Orlando, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember him saying that.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And to your knowledge, did Evvy Tavasci book a commercial flight for your family to fly to Miami to see Michael Jackson.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know who was in charge of deciding how you would get to Miami.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know who was in charge of that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know how you ended up on Chris Tucker's plane rather than a commercial flight.
Gavin Arvizo: Chris wanted to see Michael. And then we could just -- we could have just went on a ride with him because he was going over there.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you recall you, your brother, your sister and your mother going to a dental office around February 24th, 2003.
Gavin Arvizo: I remember we might have went to a dental office. I mean, I used to have braces.
Mr. Mesereau: And you went to that office to have your braces removed, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Pardon me.
Gavin Arvizo: I believe so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Well, do you remember going there from Neverland.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And it was a Dr. Seamont you went to, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: He was not too far from Neverland, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I think they were in Solvang.
Mr. Mesereau: And you had your braces removed, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes. Because my teeth started separating because the wires were all broken.
Mr. Mesereau: And who took you to that dental office.
Gavin Arvizo: I think it was Frank.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know the approximate date.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And you left Neverland and went into town that day about 2:34 in the afternoon, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And do you remember how long you were away that day, from Neverland.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: It was about five and a half hours, wasn't it.
Gavin Arvizo: As I said, I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you remember stopping in Solvang.
Gavin Arvizo: I thought that's what the orthodontist was, in Solvang.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember, when you left the office, going anywhere else.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember anybody complaining at the office that anyone in your family was being held against their will.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you have dinner or any meal in Solvang.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't remember having a dinner or a meal.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember going shopping in Solvang that day.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: No.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, your mother was mad at your L.A. dentist that put the braces on originally, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know if she was mad at him.
Mr. Mesereau: You never noticed that at all.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know who paid for your dental work in Solvang on that day.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know who paid for it.
Mr. Mesereau: And your mother was there, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Davellin was there, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: And Star was there, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay.
Gavin Arvizo: They never -- they hardly ever let us be apart. They wanted to keep us together.
Mr. Mesereau: Excuse me.
Gavin Arvizo: They never wanted us to be in separate areas. They always wanted to keep us together.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, remember you went to Toys R Us with Michael.
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, I remember.
Mr. Mesereau: Your mother wasn't there.
Gavin Arvizo: My mom was at Neverland, where they can still keep her.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh, was your mother on the trip to Toys R Us.
Gavin Arvizo: No, she was in Neverland in her unit, where they could still keep her and watch her.
Mr. Mesereau: I see. So you went into town with Michael Jackson, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. Michael took us to Toys R Us.
Mr. Mesereau: You picked up some fans, correct, on the way.
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, Michael invited some people into our -- the thing.
Mr. Mesereau: You never complained to anyone in the store or any of these fans that anyone was being held against their will, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: I was actually happy to be at Neverland all the time.
Mr. Mesereau: And you were happy to go --
Gavin Arvizo: That's something you don't really understand, is that the majority of those times was -- the first few escapes that you talk about, I liked being at Neverland. That was like Disneyland. I loved being there. I had lots of fun. I mean, my mom was the one always worried. It wasn't until the last time that I realized “I don't want to be here”.
Mr. Mesereau: Your mother was worried, but she always came back, right. Right.
Gavin Arvizo: I guess so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I'm going to show you some photographs that have been premarked. They've been shown to the prosecutor, Your Honor.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach.
The Court: They're not in evidence yet.
Mr. Mesereau: Not yet.
The Court: Can you just give me the numbers. It's for my notes. No, just -- what's the run.
Mr. Mesereau: It's Exhibit 5020 through Exhibit 5029.
The Court: Thank you.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Arvizo, I'm going to show you some photographs, and ask you if they appear accurate to you. The first one says “Jean Seamont, DDS”. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you remember going to that office.
Gavin Arvizo: That might be a little -- it's like the -- a little -- I don't know exactly how it is, but --
Mr. Mesereau: It's like a sign.
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, a sign. There we go.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that's -- that looks accurate to you, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And that is Exhibit 5020. Now I'm showing you Exhibit 5021. Does that look familiar to you.
Gavin Arvizo: A little bit. Yeah. That looks like the place that they took us to.
Mr. Mesereau: That's the dentist's office, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Appears accurate to you.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now I'm showing you Exhibit 5022. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes, I see it.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's downtown Solvang, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: That's near the dental office, isn't it.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know if that was the same place.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it look accurate to you.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know where that is.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now I'm showing you Exhibit 5023. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And does that look like the inside of the dentist's office.
Gavin Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Looks accurate to you.
Gavin Arvizo: I think it was the dentist's office.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And now I'm showing you Defense Exhibit 5024. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's the inside of the dentist's office, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I think so.
Mr. Mesereau: Looks accurate to you.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And now I'm showing you Defense Exhibit 5025. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's the inside of the dentist's office, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know if that's the same place they did my stuff, but, I mean, it looks --
Mr. Mesereau: Looks accurate to you.
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. I'm showing you now Exhibit 5026. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Inside of the dentist's office, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Look accurate to you.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Now I'm showing you Exhibit 5027. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's also the inside of the dentist's office, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I think so, yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Look accurate to you.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm now showing you Exhibit 5028. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That's the outside of the dentist's office, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know. I never went out there.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it look accurate to you.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know. I never went out there.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. And now I'm showing you Exhibit 5029. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: That's the outside of the dentist's office, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know.
Mr. Mesereau: Does it look accurate to you.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know. I never went out there.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Unless there's an objection, I'll move these photographs into evidence.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, excuse me, Your Honor. There is an objection to the ones he said he didn't know anything about, so that would be --
The Court: I've got it. 5023 is not admitted. 5025 and 502 -- no, 5028 and 5029 are not admitted. The others are all admitted.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know how long you were at that dental office, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see any telephones --
The Bailiff: Is your microphone on.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh. Pardon me. Let me start again.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know how long you were at that dental office, right.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever see any phones in that dental office.
Gavin Arvizo: No -- well, there's probably one in the front. But I didn't see one in that picture, though.
Mr. Mesereau: Did anyone in your family ever complain while you were at that dental office, “We're being held against our will”, to your knowledge.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, I'd like -- I have in front of me a Neverland Valley guest book I'd like to be marked next in order.
The Court: That would be 5030.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please.
Mr. Sanger: There is a 5030.
The Clerk: We already have a 5030. So that would be 5031.
The Court: Excuse me. 5031.
The Clerk: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Arvizo, I have -- Excuse me, Your Honor. Oh.
Mr. Sneddon: Excuse me, you know, could -- Your Honor, we've never seen this. It wasn't provided to us.
Mr. Mesereau: We produced it to them, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: I haven't seen the book. And I'd like to look at it before he asks any questions.
The Court: We'll organize this. You let her -- there you go. You got the label on it. Would you show it to the District Attorney.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, Your Honor. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, I have in front of me Defense Exhibit 5034 (sic).
The Court: They can't hear you.
Mr. Mesereau: Oh. Here we go again. I have in front of me Defense Exhibit 5031, which is a Neverland Valley guest book. May I approach the witness.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Arvizo, I'm showing you a Neverland Valley guest book that's listed as Exhibit 5031. Have you seen that before.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Where have you seen this before.
Gavin Arvizo: In the front of the -- the -- where you walk in the front entrance, there's like this podium-type thing, and it sat on there.6.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, there's some writing on the cover of that book. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that your writing.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't write that.
Gavin Arvizo: No. That's my brother's, I think.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, it says “Gavin”, doesn't it.
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't write that.
Gavin Arvizo: It says “Blow Hole and Gavin”.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know who wrote that.
Gavin Arvizo: “Blow Hole's” my brother.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't write that at all.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Do you know why your brother wrote on the cover of the guest book.
Gavin Arvizo: Because it looked cool. Because it's on the part where you can see it. I don't know. You should ask my brother.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you see him do that.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Did you ever talk to him about it.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you had looked through this guest book before, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: I didn't really look through it, but I signed it once.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. So your signature would be in there.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know if my signature would be in there. But I remember --
Mr. Mesereau: I'm sorry.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know if my signature was in there, but I remember saying, like, “Thanks for letting us come to Neverland”, and it was the first time I'd ever been to Neverland.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. But this is the book you saw at Neverland, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Move to admit Defense Exhibit 5031.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I have no objection to either option. They can put in a photocopy of the front, which is what he was questioned about, but as to the entire contents, I object.
The Court: All right. The objection is sustained as to the contents.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. With your permission, Your Honor, we can just get a duplicate of the cover.
The Court: That would be fine.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay.
The Court: You can leave -- is there an agreement that once he gets the duplicate of the cover, that he can exchange the duplicate for the original and remove the original. Or do you want to wait until the end of the trial for that.
Mr. Sneddon: No, that would be fine, Your Honor. I'm just at a little bit -- “duplicate” meaning --
The Court: The duplicate of the cover is what he was saying.
Mr. Mesereau: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Will it have the same writing on it.
The Court: “Duplicate” usually means the same. I mean, it's a duplicate.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. I'll wait till the duplicate comes in, and we can talk about it then. How's that.
The Court: Okay. All right. Go ahead, Counsel.
Mr. Mesereau: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Arvizo, according to you, it's your brother's handwriting, right.
Gavin Arvizo: It kind of looks like it. But I don't know if it is.
Mr. Mesereau: And it says, “Hi, Doe-Doe, it's your Blow Hole. I love with you all my heart. Love forever, your Blow Hole, Gavin”. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: It says “Blow Hole and Gavin”. It doesn't say “Blow Hole” --
Mr. Mesereau: It looks like an “F”.
The Court: Counsel, you're testifying.
Mr. Mesereau: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Okay.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't see your brother do this, right.
Gavin Arvizo: No --
Mr. Sneddon: Asked and answered, Your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, I have in front of me an exhibit, No. 5032, which is a photocopy of a mannequin. I'd like to approach the witness, if I may.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Arvizo, I'm showing you a document that's labeled Exhibit 5032. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that appears to be a photograph of a mannequin, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Appears to be an African-American girl with braids, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: With a blue jean jacket, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And a pink shirt. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Have you seen that mannequin before.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes, I saw it in Michael's bedroom.
Mr. Mesereau: Is that the mannequin that you're claiming Mr. Jackson simulated a sex act with.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, did you ever discuss with Mr. Jackson where that mannequin came from.
Gavin Arvizo: No. He said that -- there was a bunch of mannequins all over his bedroom.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, did he ever tell you this was something that was custom made and it's a mannequin of a cousin of his.
Gavin Arvizo: No. He just said that he has lots of mannequins.
Mr. Mesereau: So you never discussed with him what this mannequin was all about, right.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You never knew that this mannequin was something that was paid for and custom made because it's his cousin.
Gavin Arvizo: He never told me that.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Okay. When did you first see this mannequin.
Gavin Arvizo: In his bedroom. Where the bed actually is.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you know approximately when that was.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't -- probably the first time I went in his room I saw it there. And then the second time I was in his room. All the way after Miami was when we made the joke about it.
Mr. Mesereau: At some point you learned that somebody had defaced that mannequin, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Defaced. What do you mean.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes. Somebody had taken like a magic marker and messed up that mannequin, right.
Gavin Arvizo: No, I don't remember that.
Mr. Mesereau: Your Honor, at this time I'd like to approach the witness and show him Exhibit No. 5033, which is a photograph --
The Court: All right.
Mr. Mesereau: -- of a mannequin as well.
Mr. Mesereau: Mr. Arvizo, I'm showing you Defense Exhibit No. 5033. Do you see that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And do you see where somebody went into the vaginal portion of that mannequin and defaced it with a magic marker.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes. I see that, I guess.
Mr. Mesereau: You know who did that, don't you.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: May I publish this, Your Honor.
The Court: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You don't know who did that at all.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You didn't do it.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Your brother didn't do it.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: May I approach one more time.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you see the skirt on the mannequin in Defense Exhibit 5032.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: Same material as you see on the mannequin in Defense Exhibit 5033, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I guess so. Yeah.
Mr. Mesereau: But you've never seen this defaced portion --
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: -- right.
Gavin Arvizo: No. No.
Mr. Mesereau: Do you know why your brother defaced the guest book.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. Counsel's testifying. And he's already said he didn't do it.
Mr. Mesereau: I didn't ask if he did it.
The Court: Sustained; calls for speculation.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Move to admit Defense Exhibits 5032 and 5033, Your Honor.
The Court: They haven't been properly identified. So it's denied.
Mr. Mesereau: Exhibit 5032 is the photograph of the mannequin that I showed Mr. Sneddon.
The Court: That one is admitted.
Mr. Mesereau: And 5033 is also a photograph of the same mannequin.
The Court: But it hasn't been identified as to the marking you're talking about. He has never seen it that way, so we don't know who did it, when it was done. There's no foundation.
Mr. Mesereau: We'll do it -- we'll do it later, then.
The Court: All right. No foundation.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. All right.
Mr. Mesereau: Finally, Mr. Arvizo, in your direct examination, you commented a couple of times on Mr. Jackson wearing makeup. Do you remember that.
Gavin Arvizo: Here.
Mr. Mesereau: When you were answering Prosecutor Sneddon's questions, a couple of times you used the word “makeup” in referring to Michael Jackson, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I said one time when he was -- a story about a time when we were in the room where his makeup was, but I don't remember me saying it a lot of times.
Mr. Mesereau: Now, you knew that Michael Jackson has a skin disease called vitiligo, right.
Gavin Arvizo: He told me about it.
Mr. Mesereau: And he told you that he's an African-American man with a skin disease that eats up pigment in his skin, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you knew that that disease was causing certain patches of white and brown on his skin, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes. I guess.
Mr. Mesereau: And --
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know. It's not like I was making fun of him yesterday, if that's what you're trying to imply.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you knew that his skin is vulnerable to sunlight, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And that's why you see him with an umbrella, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: And you also knew, because of the patches that appear on his skin from that disease, he does sometimes put some makeup on, right.
Gavin Arvizo: I didn't know about patches. I thought he was just all white.
Mr. Mesereau: Well, you discussed the skin disease with him, right.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Mesereau: You knew the skin disease was changing the color of his skin, right.
Gavin Arvizo: That's what he told me.
Mr. Mesereau: And you knew that's why he put makeup on; true.
Gavin Arvizo: Not really. I thought it was just because he had, like -- because he -- he didn't have pink on his lips, so he would put makeup on his lips. I mean, I wasn't making fun of him yesterday, if that's what you are trying to say.
Mr. Mesereau: You weren't making fun of him at all.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. Now, you're aware, are you not, that you have until the age of 18 to file a lawsuit against Mr. Jackson if you choose to, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: You've never discussed that with your mother.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Never discussed that with Larry Feldman, the attorney.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: And never discussed it with Bill Dickerman, the attorney.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Okay. You're also aware that if Mr. Jackson is convicted, you could automatically win that civil suit, right.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: No one's ever discussed that with you.
Gavin Arvizo: No. We said things like, oh, we don't want his money, and stuff like that.
Mr. Mesereau: Never discussed that issue with any attorney, right.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: First time you've heard about it.
Gavin Arvizo: About that I can -- you just told me now that I can sue him till I'm 18 or something like that. I didn't even know about that stuff.
Mr. Mesereau: Didn't even know about that, right. And never heard your mother mention it.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: No further questions.
The Court: Redirect.
Mr. Sneddon: Yes.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. SNEDDON:
Mr. Sneddon: Morning, Gavin.
Gavin Arvizo: Hey, Tom.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to ask you just a few questions. It won't be long. First of all, with regard to this particular case, Mr. Mesereau has asked you a lot of questions about did you have conversations with your brother and your mother and other people about what you've testified here in court today.
Gavin Arvizo: Uh-huh.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall those questions.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you said you did not.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Were you given some instructions with regard to who you could talk to and who you couldn't talk to about this case.
Gavin Arvizo: You guys told us that we can't talk to anybody about this case. Well, our family and -- anyone that was, like, involved; you know what I mean.
Mr. Sneddon: When were you told that.
Gavin Arvizo: When the case first started.
Mr. Sneddon: So from the time you were first involved in the case till today, those were the instructions you were given.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And have you followed those instructions faithfully.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Mr. Mesereau asked you yesterday about the fact that when you went through chemotherapy you had some temporary memory loss and inability to concentrate at some points in time.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: At the time that these events occurred at Neverland Ranch involving you and the defendant, Michael Jackson, were any of those effects from the chemotherapy still present with you.
Gavin Arvizo: No, they went away after a while.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember Mr. Mesereau asking you about a video that was taken during one of your first trips to Neverland, with you and Mr. Jackson, when we saw the music “I'll Be There”. Do you remember that one.
Gavin Arvizo: The one where he carried me and stuff.
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah. Do you remember that video.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: When was the first time you saw that video.
Gavin Arvizo: Um, it was probably -- I think they brought it to Chris at his house, and that was the first time I saw it.
Mr. Sneddon: Who brought it to Chris.
Gavin Arvizo: I think it was -- or -- I don't remember the first time. It could have been either at the hotel in Miami or at Chris's house before we left. But I'm not sure.
Mr. Sneddon: So up until the time -- that photograph was taken back in 2000 when you were just starting your chemotherapy, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: So from the time in 2000 when the video was produced until the time that you went to Miami, or shortly before Miami, with Chris Tucker, you had never been given a copy of that by Mr. Jackson.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Did Mr. Jackson ever visit you in the hospital when you were sick.
Gavin Arvizo: Never.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you told us that you had some telephone numbers for Mr. Jackson that had been given to you by Mr. Jackson or somebody else.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Who gave you the phone numbers.
Gavin Arvizo: It was usually Michael. But, like, Frank gave me his phone and he said that he was usually with Michael, so that I can call his phone and then he can give me Michael.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there times when you called Frank's phone and got ahold of Mr. Jackson.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you have conversations with the defendant, Mr. Jackson, about his relationship with the person that you call Frank Tyson.
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. Frank told me, like, he's like his --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: You say you had a conversation.
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah. I had a conversation, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Now, first of all, I want to ask you, did Mr. Jackson make statements about his relationship with Frank.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, offered under 1223.
Mr. Mesereau: Same objection.
The Court: I'll admit it. These are statements by Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: They are, Your Honor. About his relationship with a co-conspirator.
The Court: All right. These are admitted conditionally, as the other statements were.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, what did the defendant, Mr. Jackson, say about his relationship with Frank Tyson.
Gavin Arvizo: He told us that Frank was like his second cousin or something. And then that Michael would change his diapers when he was a baby, and stuff like that.
Mr. Sneddon: So he had known him for a long, long time.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you testified, you were asked by Mr. Mesereau some questions concerning the Martin Bashir documentary. Do you recall that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, what I want to ask you is, before you went to Miami and saw Mr. Jackson in Miami - okay --.
Gavin Arvizo: Uh-huh.
Mr. Sneddon: -- what was it -- what portions of that video had you seen at anyplace.
Gavin Arvizo: I haven't seen it -- I didn't see it at all. I just saw news media talking about it, talking about a movie or something. I didn't really know what it was until I got to Miami.
Mr. Sneddon: So before you went to Miami you had heard media talking about it. Did you actually see any footage on T.V..
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: You just heard the voices.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: When you got to Miami, did you see the Bashir video.
Gavin Arvizo: No, Michael didn't want us to see it in his hotel so --
Mr. Sneddon: Did you see any parts of it.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you told the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that when you went to Miami that you were upset with somebody over the Bashir documentary. Do you recall that.
Gavin Arvizo: Um --
Mr. Sneddon: Actually, let me rephrase that. Mr. Mesereau asked you if your mother was upset with somebody when you went to Miami. Do you recall that.
Gavin Arvizo: Not really.
Mr. Sneddon: Were you upset with anybody, or angry.
Gavin Arvizo: I was angry at -- kind of angry at Martin Bashir.
Mr. Sneddon: At who.
Gavin Arvizo: Martin Bashir.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know what your mother's attitude was towards that, if you know.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't remember.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you told the ladies and gentlemen of the jury a few moments ago that when Mr. Mesereau asked you how you knew Mr. Jackson was in Miami, do you recall that question.
Gavin Arvizo: I'm sorry, can you repeat the question.
Mr. Sneddon: I want to take you to that point in time with regard to where you -- when you learned that Mr. Jackson was in Miami.
Gavin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Before you went to Miami.
Gavin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Who was it that told you that Mr. Jackson was in Miami.
Gavin Arvizo: Michael. Evvy said that Michael's going to call me in a few minutes. Well, I told my mother. And then Michael called on the phone, and I picked up, and he told me that he was in Miami and he wanted me to go over there.
Mr. Sneddon: Was that the first time that you learned that Mr. Jackson was in Miami.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And that's when he invited you to be a part of a press conference.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Just a couple of questions about things that happened at the ranch. You were questioned by Mr. Mesereau about the nanny named Grace. Do you recall that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And about -- specifically about the area upstairs, where it had some -- a chalkboard and some tables and things.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: During the time that you were at the ranch, did you ever see anybody other than Grace come in as a teacher to the children.
Gavin Arvizo: I think they switched -- I think Grace went away for a while. And then some other lady came.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know who that lady was.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, you've identified in one of the photographs a person by the name of Aldo. Do you recall that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Was Aldo at the ranch during times that you were there with Mr. Jackson.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall when it was that you were there -- when -- Tuesday morning. Do you recall in relationship to when you and Mr. Jackson were there, what part of the visit was it that Aldo was there.
Gavin Arvizo: In the beginning.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, there was a considerable amount of discussion about the codes that were needed to get into certain areas of the ranch.
Gavin Arvizo: Uh-huh.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to the -- let's just run through this real quickly. With regard to the theater, did you need a code to get in there.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the arcade, did you need a code to get in there.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the main house, did you need a code to get in there.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: In the front door.
Gavin Arvizo: No, in the back door. Oh, it was in the front door, I never really saw one. But, I mean, we always went through the back door.
Mr. Sneddon: So there was a code that was necessary to know to get into the back door of the house.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And then there was a code to get into Mr. Jackson's bedroom, we've heard a great deal about.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Were there any other areas on the ranch that you know of that you needed a code to get into those areas.
Gavin Arvizo: No, there was no other place.
Mr. Sneddon: How about Mr. Jackson's office.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't really remember if there was a code needed to get in there. I don't think there was.
Mr. Sneddon: When you went to Miami with Chris Tucker on his charter plane to meet Mr. Jackson, did you want to meet Mr. Jackson.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Gavin, when you testified in front of the grand jury, did you tell the truth.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you testified in front of the grand jury, were the things that you told the grand jury fresh in your mind at that time.
Gavin Arvizo: They were probably fresher.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; leading.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm laying the foundation for an Evidence Code section exception.
The Court: All right. The objection is overruled. The answer was already in. Next question.
Mr. Sneddon: Yesterday Mr. Mesereau showed you a number of cards, greeting cards, that were sent to Mr. Jackson by you and other members of your family.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Were some of those -- were any of those cards in handwritings other than yours.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes. Some were mine.
Mr. Sneddon: Yesterday you made a statement to the jury in response to one of Mr. Mesereau's statements. You made a statement something to the effect, “God gave me cancer to guide me in a certain way”. Do you recall that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What did you mean by that.
Gavin Arvizo: Well, through -- when I had cancer, I got really close to God. And they had like missions all over the West Coast down to Mexico praying for me. They had -- I don't know. Something happened where they had a picture and they put on a wall. And then my friend went to Israel and put a picture on this wall where they put, like, all these people that have, like, diseases and stuff like that. And then -- I don't know. Because of my cancer, my parents started fighting more, I guess. And -- I mean, it sounds kind of sad that they got divorced, but, I mean, it was kind of a window, I believe, to find my stepdad and -- because it's a lot better than it was before having my stepdad in my life.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you're currently in school, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Just -- are you in school.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: You're in a high school.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What grade are you.
Gavin Arvizo: I'm in ninth grade.
Mr. Sneddon: And yesterday you were asked -- I think you made the statement rather candidly, you were asked by Mr. Mesereau, were you a discipline problem, and you said yes, when you were at John Burroughs.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Currently in the high school that you're in, do you get good grades.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you make the honor roll.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you get in fights anymore.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Overruled. The answer was “No”. Next question.
Mr. Sneddon: Have you had any discipline problems.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Are you involved in after-school activities.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: During the time that you were -- let's go back just a second. In the year, I believe you testified 2001, at some point your father left; is that correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Right after I was done with cancer, I didn't see him anymore.
Mr. Sneddon: What was the impact on you when your dad left.
Gavin Arvizo: I cried every night.
Mr. Sneddon: For -- why.
Gavin Arvizo: Because, I mean, I didn't have a dad anymore. I mean, I was kind of happy that he left because he hit my mom a lot, but I didn't -- I just felt like I didn't have anybody. Any father; you know what I mean.
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah. And you don't feel that way anymore.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Because of.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; relevance.
Gavin Arvizo: My stepdad.
The Court: Overruled.
Gavin Arvizo: Because of my stepdad.
Mr. Sneddon: So it was the relationship with your stepdad that changed that feeling.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: So let's talk a little bit about some of the things Mr. Mesereau talked about yesterday. Mr. Geraldt. He talked about an incident where you had a run-in with Mr. Geraldt that ended up you going to see Mr. Alpert. Do you recall that.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't know if I saw Mr. Alpert, but I remember seeing a -- some -- someone that was in the office.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever receive any discipline as a result of that incident with Mr. Geraldt.
Gavin Arvizo: No, I don't think -- no, they never even did anything.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when you went back to school after you left Neverland Ranch - okay --.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- March and April, you were at John Burroughs, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Did -- what was -- what was it like when you went back to school.
Gavin Arvizo: All the kids would laugh at me and try to push me around and stuff, and say, “That's the kid that got raped by Michael Jackson”, and stuff like that.
Mr. Sneddon: Did -- what was your reaction to that.
Gavin Arvizo: I would sometimes not say anything and just walk away. And if they got close enough, sometimes I would fight them. After they hit me first, because I didn't like to throw the first punch, because I believe that -- I mean --
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; nonresponsive.
The Court: I'll sustain the objection. In the middle, “After they hit me first”, is where it stops.
Mr. Sneddon: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: So there were fights that you got into after you left Neverland Valley Ranch because of the things that the kids were saying to you.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you get in a fight, what happens. Where do you have to go.
Gavin Arvizo: They took us to Dean Alpert.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you were asked yesterday whether you had a conversation with Dean Alpert where he asked you whether or not Mr. Jackson had touched you. Do you recall that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you recall that you probably told him it didn't happen, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: I told him that it didn't happen.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. You told him it didn't happen.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Why did you tell him that.
Gavin Arvizo: Because all the kids were already making fun of me in school, and I didn't want anybody to think that it really happened.
Mr. Sneddon: Gavin, have you ever been a member of a gang.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Did anybody ever ask you to join a gang.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: What happened.
Gavin Arvizo: They jumped me because I said no. So I got in a fight with a bunch of guys.
Mr. Sneddon: Because you wouldn't join a gang.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Almost done. Just a couple more easy questions and -- Mr. Mesereau asked you yesterday about going to Anchor Blue. Do you recall that.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: How many times do you recall going to shop at Anchor Blue.
Gavin Arvizo: Once.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, the suitcases that they bought you -- I just want to talk about you individually, okay --.
Gavin Arvizo: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: -- was it more than one.
Gavin Arvizo: It was -- like, they had this package thing where you would buy one, and they would have all -- they would have this big one, and in the inside it would be one smaller, and another one that was even smaller that was a carry-on bag.
Mr. Sneddon: So you had a series of suitcases.
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah, and -- yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you left Neverland, did you take all those suitcases with you, you personally.
Gavin Arvizo: I think I just took the -- no, I didn't take them. They -- after we left and we stopped -- we didn't want to go back --
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Gavin Arvizo: -- Frank and Vinnie showed up on our door and they were knocking on the door. And then we waited until they left, and we looked outside and our suitcases were there.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you open your suitcase and go through it.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Was there anything missing.
Gavin Arvizo: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: What.
Gavin Arvizo: Some of my underwear, some of my shirts, a couple pants, and stuff like that. And they put in some other guy's pants.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever have a conversation with the defendant in this case, Mr. Jackson, about your underpants.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Tell the jury about it.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection; beyond the scope.
The Court: Overruled.
Gavin Arvizo: There was one time that I slept in his room - and he was probably joking but I kind of took it serious - I had pajamas on and -- I was using his pajamas. And I told him I was going in to take a shower in my unit. And then he was like, “Leave your stinking underwear in the hamper”, or something like that. And then so -- because I had to change out of my clothes to go to my unit. And then I don't know if he was joking or not, but I actually did.
Mr. Sneddon: Did what.
Gavin Arvizo: Put my underwear in the hamper.
Mr. Sneddon: Did you ever get those back.
Gavin Arvizo: No.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the items that were dropped at your -- at your door by Frank and Vinnie, that was after you left Neverland for good.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Gavin, I just have one last question to ask you: Yesterday in response to Mr. Mesereau's questions, you told him that Mr. Jackson was like a father figure to you; is that correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Michael Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And that you thought he was one of the coolest guys in the world, correct.
Gavin Arvizo: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And that you admired him.
Gavin Arvizo: Well, I only admire God, but he was a pretty cool guy.
Mr. Sneddon: How do you feel about Mr. Jackson now in light of what he did to you.
Mr. Mesereau: Objection. 352; relevance; leading.
The Court: Overruled.
Gavin Arvizo: I don't really like him anymore. I don't think he's really that deserving of the respect that I was giving him and as the coolest guy in the world.
Mr. Sneddon: Nothing further, Your Honor.
The Court: Recross.
Mr. Mesereau: Yes, please, Your Honor.

Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: What is your current occupation.
Terry Flaa: I'm a police officer employed by the Santa Maria Police Department.
Mr. Zonen: And you've been employed by Santa Maria Police Department for how long.
Terry Flaa: About 14 months.
Mr. Zonen: What is your current position with Santa Maria Police Department.
Terry Flaa: I'm a patrolman.
Mr. Zonen: Prior to your employment with Santa Maria Police Department, where were you employed.
Terry Flaa: I was with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department.
Mr. Zonen: And for what period of time.
Terry Flaa: A little over -- around eight and a half years.
Mr. Zonen: And you moved from the sheriff's office in Santa Barbara County to Santa Maria Police Department.
Terry Flaa: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: And why did you do that.
Terry Flaa: I -- I'm from the Santa Maria area. It was an agency I always wanted to work for, and the opportunity was there, so I took that opportunity.
Mr. Zonen: And you are able to work closer to your home at this time.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. What was the position that you held at the time that you left the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office.
Terry Flaa: I was an investigator assigned to the vice and intelligence unit.
Mr. Zonen: Were you called upon to conduct an investigation of a referral that had come into the office.
Terry Flaa: Yes, I was.
Mr. Zonen: And do you know which one I'm referring to.
Terry Flaa: Yes, I do.
Mr. Zonen: All right. You have some sense of what case this is; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: I do.
Mr. Zonen: When was that referral. When did that referral come into the office.
Terry Flaa: It was assigned to me on February 20th.
Mr. Zonen: What was the nature of the referral.
Terry Flaa: The nature of the referral --
Mr. Zonen: Excuse me, February 20th of what year, please.
Terry Flaa: I'm sorry. 2003.
Mr. Zonen: All right. What was the nature of the referral.
Terry Flaa: I had received two referrals. The first referral was from L.A. Department of Child & Family Services that stressed -- a caller had stressed concern over the welfare of Mr. Jackson's children. The second referral was in response to the February 6th, I believe it was, airing of the documentary regarding Mr. Jackson. And that referral revealed the identities of the children depicted, specifically of Gavin Arvizo.
Mr. Zonen: And what did you do in terms of conducting an investigation on that referral.
Terry Flaa: Well, the first thing that we did is I conferred with my immediate supervisor, Sergeant LeGault, and we were going to begin the process of interviewing the children. However, a few days later, on the 24th, I was advised that L.A. CWS -- or DCFS, pardon me, had already interviewed the Arvizo family.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know when that interview took place.
Terry Flaa: That interview took place on February 20th of 2003.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have a conversation with anybody from the Department of Child & Family Services in Los Angeles.
Terry Flaa: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: With whom did you have a conversation.
Terry Flaa: Her name was -- excuse me, Brenda Blackburn, who was a supervisor.
Mr. Zonen: Did she submit to you or forward to you any documentation of that interview.
Terry Flaa: No, she did not.
Mr. Zonen: Is there a report that they prepared with regards to that interview.
Terry Flaa: I was told that there was, yes.
Mr. Zonen: What did she tell you with regards to your being able to get possession of that report at that time.
Terry Flaa: At that time she told me that, due to confidentiality reasons, that the DCFS would not be able to forward that document to the sheriff's department.
Mr. Zonen: Did she relate to you the content of the document itself.
Terry Flaa: Yes. She did, however, explain that she would be able to read the report to me, and which she did.
Mr. Zonen: And did you tape-record that conversation.
Terry Flaa: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did she read to you, presumably, the report in its entirety.
Terry Flaa: According to what she told me, yes.
Mr. Zonen: What was the date that she read to you that report.
Terry Flaa: March 13th, 2003.
Mr. Zonen: Now, did Miss Blackburn indicate to you that she was the one who actually interviewed the children.
Terry Flaa: No, she did not actually interview the children.
Mr. Zonen: So she was reading a report of interviews conducted by other workers.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did she indicate the identity of those workers.
Terry Flaa: Yes. If I may, may I refer to my narrative to confirm that date of March 13th.
Mr. Zonen: Yes. Please go ahead.
Terry Flaa: Refresh my memory.
Mr. Zonen: Yes, go ahead.
Terry Flaa: Thank you.
The Court: After he does that, we will take our break.
Terry Flaa: I apologize. It was actually March 10th, 2003, that I spoke to Brenda Blackburn.
The Court: All right. Let's take our break.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: You may proceed, Counsel.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Zonen: Officer Flaa, just a clarification, please. You indicated the unit that you were assigned to at the time that you left the sheriff's office was what again.
Terry Flaa: That was the --
Bailiff Cortez: Microphone, please.
Mr. Zonen: How's this.
A Juror: Turn it on.
Mr. Zonen: How's this.
Mr. Zonen: The unit that you were assigned to at the time you left the sheriff's office was which again.
Terry Flaa: The vice and the intelligence unit.
Mr. Zonen: Was that the unit that you were in at the time that this referral came into the office back on the 20th of February of 2003.
Terry Flaa: No, sir.
Mr. Zonen: What unit were you attached to at that time.
Terry Flaa: At that time I was a detective assigned to the Criminal Investigations Division.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Now, you told us that when this came in, you had a conversation with Brenda Blackburn from the Department of Child & Family Services in Los Angeles.
Terry Flaa: Yes, sir.
Mr. Zonen: Did you have a conversation with anybody else.
Terry Flaa: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: With whom.
Terry Flaa: David Arvizo.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Who did you understand David Arvizo to be.
Terry Flaa: To be the father of the Arvizo siblings.
Mr. Zonen: Did you make a determination as to whether or not the children should be interviewed by the sheriff's department, Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department, by you or some other designated detective.
Terry Flaa: After the interview with CWS.
Mr. Zonen: Yes, that's right. After CWS indicated to you that they had already done the interview.
Terry Flaa: We had made a determination that an interview would not be necessary.
Mr. Zonen: Was there any information that was given to you that there was a disclosure of child sexual abuse at all.
Terry Flaa: No, no information.
Mr. Zonen: And was there any further investigation conducted by the sheriff's office at that time.
Terry Flaa: No, there was not.
Mr. Zonen: Was the investigation closed at that time.
Terry Flaa: Yes, it was.
Mr. Zonen: The date of the interview with -- again, with Child -- I'm sorry, with Miss Blackburn was what date now.
Terry Flaa: March 10th, 2003.
Mr. Zonen: And when was your interview with Mr. Arvizo.
Terry Flaa: March 13th, 2003.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you. I have no further questions. Oh, excuse me. One last question.
Mr. Zonen: Did you make a report of this.
Terry Flaa: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: And did you indicate in your report the date that the referral came in and the date of your interviews.
Terry Flaa: I indicated the date that I received the referral.
Mr. Zonen: And the date of your interview with Miss Blackburn.
Terry Flaa: Yes, sir.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And did you also include with it a -- the copy of the tape that you had of the interview with Miss Blackburn.
Terry Flaa: Yes. I booked that in as evidence.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you. No further questions.
The Court: Cross-examine.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: Officer Flaa; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct, Mr. Sanger.
Mr. Sanger: First of all, you were with the sheriff's department for eight and a half years; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sanger: And what was the date that you terminated your services with the sheriff's department.
Terry Flaa: It was in the beginning of January, 2004. I don't recall the specific -- I think it was like January 2nd, that week.
Mr. Sanger: Now, you have told us that you went to the Santa Maria Police Department, right. That's where you are now.
Terry Flaa: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sanger: Did you not like your job as a detective in the intelligence and vice division.
Terry Flaa: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sanger: You liked it, okay.
Terry Flaa: Uh-huh.
Mr. Sanger: You filed a report, as you've just told us, saying that you found there was no criminal activity in this case; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And you filed that report on April the 16th, right.
Terry Flaa: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: You were aware that at some time later, there was a further investigation of this case; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Now, did you continue on in your capacity as a detective at the sheriff's department until you transferred or until you quit and went on to the Santa Maria Police Department.
Terry Flaa: Two different type of positions. It was -- I believe it was March of 2003, mid March - I think it was like March 20th, 2003 - is when I ended my tenure as a detective assigned to the Criminal Investigations Division and had the opportunity to assume the role as -- an undercover role with my vice and intelligence unit.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. When this investigation was reestablished -- do you know when it was reestablished.
Terry Flaa: No.
Mr. Sanger: Did you forward any documents, for instance, to Detective Zelis.
Terry Flaa: Any documents.
Mr. Sanger: Did you furnish any report to Detective Zelis.
Terry Flaa: They had my original report. I did not personally hand them a copy of the report.
Mr. Sanger: So you were not -- you were not assigned to continue the investigation that you started in this case; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And Detective Zelis started his investigation about June the 13th; is that right.
Terry Flaa: I don't know when he started it.
Mr. Sanger: Roughly sometime in June, is that your understanding, or you don't know at all.
Terry Flaa: I do not know what date the investigation commenced.
The Court: What year are you referring to, Counsel.
Mr. Sanger: 2003.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Let's go back to the source of the referral in this case. You indicated you received a referral from two different places; is that right. Or -- or two different referrals. I'm sorry.
Terry Flaa: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sanger: And the information for those referrals came from two different places; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's my understanding.
Mr. Sanger: And you reviewed the referral documents; is that right.
Terry Flaa: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sanger: And the referral documents were from the Los Angeles Department of Children & Family Services, correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sanger: And they call that the DCFS.
Terry Flaa: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sanger: Okay.
Terry Flaa: My understanding.
Mr. Sanger: And that's sort of like what we call CPS here in Santa Barbara County.
Terry Flaa: Or CWS. They changed it. Child Welfare Services.
Mr. Sanger: So CPS, or now CWS, that's what we call it. They call it DCFS.
Terry Flaa: My understanding, yes.
Mr. Sanger: So you received the reports, the two reports, that were entitled “Suspected Child Abuse Report”; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And the first report was actually generated by a Carol Lieberman; is that your understanding. Do you want to look at the report.
Terry Flaa: If I may, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Yes. And I believe you attached these two reports to your narrative report, did you not.
Terry Flaa: I did.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. I think it's page ten might help you.
Terry Flaa: Okay. Yes, I see that.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, let me just stop there for a moment and talk about your qualifications. You went to the academy, POST academy; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And the POST academy is a certification for an academy that can give training to -- official training to people who are going to become law enforcement officers in the State of California; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Which POST academy did you go to.
Terry Flaa: I attended Allan Hancock College's academy.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And they have an official academy there. People can go there, learn to be police officers, and get a certification so that they can apply for the job; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And in the course of the academy, you take courses in investigation; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: You take courses in report writing.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you basically learn how to take a case from the initial part of an investigation through as far as a police officer would take it; is that right.
Terry Flaa: The basic -- yes.
Mr. Sanger: Now, since your academy training, you also had other inservice training; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And as of 2000 -- February -- March of 2003, how much inservice training had you had.
Terry Flaa: Would you like me to list the various types of training specific to this type of case work.
Mr. Sanger: That would be fine.
Terry Flaa: Okay. I attended a 40-hour sexual assault investigator's course, a 24-hour child forensic interview course, an 80-hour homicide course that touched on, you know, sexual assault abuse aspects of homicide, as well as inservice training. There's been some eight-hour courses here and there for different aspects of this type of investigation.
Mr. Sanger: And as a police officer -- or, strike that -- as a deputy sheriff, before becoming a detective in the sheriff's department, did you have occasion to investigate cases related to child abuse.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then when you became a detective, did you have occasion to investigate additional cases.
Terry Flaa: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sanger: And how long were you a detect -- excuse me. How long were you a detective as of March of 2003.
Terry Flaa: Four years. Roughly four years.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So suffice it to say, you were an experienced detective with regard to suspected child abuse cases; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes. I would say.
Mr. Sanger: And when you were assigned this case, you were aware, of course, that we were talking about the entertainer Michael Jackson; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you were aware that there had been a good deal of media attention given to Mr. Jackson immediately preceding the time that you started your investigation; is that right.
Terry Flaa: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, we're going back to that question about Carol Lieberman. As an experienced child abuse investigator, when you have a complaining -- I'm sorry, when you have a reporting party, is it of interest to the investigator to know who the reporting party is.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And in your department, in the sheriff's department, did you call the reporting party an RP.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So the RP, the reporting party, is often what starts an investigation. Somebody calls in, they're an RP, and that starts your investigation, correct.
Terry Flaa: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Particularly in child abuse -- suspected child abuse cases, knowing a good deal about the reporting party is generally useful to the investigation, correct.
Terry Flaa: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: People may have all sorts of agendas when they call in a child abuse report; is that right.
Terry Flaa: Excuse me. Yes. That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: I think there's some water there, if you want to --
Terry Flaa: Thank you.
Mr. Sanger: In this particular case, did you determine who Carol Lieberman was.
Terry Flaa: No.
Mr. Sanger: Were you aware that she has never met Michael Jackson.
Terry Flaa: No.
Mr. Sanger: Were you aware that she never met Michael Jackson's children.
Terry Flaa: If I may. Regarding that referral --
Mr. Sanger: Yes.
Terry Flaa: -- my investigative responsibility was not specifically this referral. It would have been -- the other would have been within our jurisdictional responsibility.
Mr. Sanger: Well, we're going to get to the other in a second.
Terry Flaa: So here, you know, I did not conduct any formal investigation into that referral's accusations.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, I don't mean to argue with you, but I believe on direct you did say you had two referrals when you started your investigation, right.
Terry Flaa: There were two referrals that came in, yes, sir.
Mr. Sanger: And you knew this was an important case to investigate carefully, correct.
Terry Flaa: Right.
Mr. Sanger: And one of the referrals was from Carol Lieberman --
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- right. Now, I understand what you just said about the second one, which we'll get to. But I'm asking you if you did any investigation on Carol Lieberman.
Terry Flaa: No, sir.
Mr. Sanger: Did you Google her name, run it on the Internet.
Mr. Zonen: Your Honor, I'll object. The witness has said he did not do an investigation of that referral.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Well, let me ask you, are you saying you did no investigation whatsoever with regard to this -- with regard to this report.
Mr. Zonen: Which report. Vague.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sanger: That's fine. Let me rephrase it.
Mr. Sanger: You indicated you had two referrals. And the first one was from Carol Lieberman, right.
Terry Flaa: I indicated there were -- two referrals had come in from DCFS, yes.
Mr. Sanger: So my question is, what, if anything, did you do with regard to the first referral.
Terry Flaa: The one where you have stated Carol Lieberman's the RP.
Mr. Sanger: Right.
Terry Flaa: Okay. Nothing.
Mr. Sanger: You read it.
Terry Flaa: Oh, I apologize. Yes, I read the referral when it came in.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And did you consider it as you conducted your investigation.
Terry Flaa: No.
Mr. Sanger: So as far as you were concerned, this had no significance whatsoever.
Terry Flaa: No, this would have been under CWS's, Child Welfare Services', jurisdictional responsibility, not mine, per se, based on the information in the referral.
Mr. Sanger: And as an investigator, you didn't think it was significant to find out who was making the referral, why there was even a referral there.
Terry Flaa: Not for that specific referral.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, the second referral that you talked about is also attached to your reports; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: So we're talking about the same thing here. And the second referral, this is the one you're saying now was the focus of your investigation.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And in this referral -- let me withdraw that. This referral comes from a director or somebody in the administration of the L.A School District; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And in the referral, the DCSF people indicate that the -- Attorney Gloria Allred had complained to Santa Barbara County officials regarding the Bashir tape; is that correct. Second to the last paragraph, page 15.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And do you know who Gloria Allred is.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: She's a lawyer in Los Angeles; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Tends to get on television a lot; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And she has -- in the course of your investigation, you determined she had absolutely no firsthand information whatsoever with regard to Michael Jackson or any of this; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: I did not attempt to make any type of -- that type of determination.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So the second report basically was a revelation by the school district that they had a belief that the people in the Bashir film were students in the L.A. Unified School District; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And they identified the people by name; that is, Gavin and Star Arvizo; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, when you refer -- excuse me. When you reviewed these two reports -- let me withdraw that. Other than these two reports, did you have any other information to commence your investigation.
Terry Flaa: No.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Did you talk with Mr. Sneddon about the case.
Terry Flaa: No, I did not.
Mr. Sanger: Did you talk to any other people in your department about the case.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Now, you talked to Lieutenant Klapakis; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And in the course of talking to Lieutenant Klapakis, you and he decided that you should attempt to interview the children, Gavin and Star Arvizo; is that right.
Terry Flaa: Actually, that conversation would have been between my immediate supervisor at the time, who was Sergeant LeGault, and myself. We had that conversation. We have a chain of command to follow, and Lieutenant Klapakis was Sergeant LeGault's supervisor. All of ours, but within that chain of command.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So let's pin this down a little bit. Did you talk to Lieutenant Klapakis yourself about interviewing the children.
Terry Flaa: I do not recall if I specifically spoke to Lieutenant Klapakis directly. I know that most of my communications were with Sergeant LeGault. So -- and understand, their offices are right next to each other. My desk was virtually in earshot of both offices, so he very well could have been party to one of the conversations.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So you see -- you would see -- at the time, in February and March and April of 2003, you would see Lieutenant Klapakis on a regular basis, correct.
Terry Flaa: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Do you recall testifying at the grand jury in this case.
Terry Flaa: I do.
Mr. Sanger: Do you, by any chance, have your grand jury testimony there in front of you.
Terry Flaa: I do.
Mr. Sanger: Let me just ask you to do this: Why don't you take a look at your testimony. You're welcome to read the whole thing if you'd like. I'm going to ask you to direct your attention to pages 1440, starting at about line 20, going through 1441, line 16. And I'm going to ask you to just read that to yourself and see if that refreshes your recollection as to whether or not you talked to Lieutenant Klapakis directly.
Terry Flaa: You said line 20 on page 1440.
Mr. Sanger: 1440, start there. But -- you can start wherever you want, but that's where I'd like you to focus on. And going on to the next page.
Terry Flaa: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Does that refresh your recollection that you had talked with Lieutenant Klapakis about interviewing the children.
Terry Flaa: Like I said, in reading that, it doesn't say I specifically told Lieutenant Klapakis. I know that the decision -- that the decisions that I was informed of were handed down by Lieutenant Klapakis, my supervisor. And, you know, understand, please, that Sergeant LeGault is within that chain of command.
Mr. Sanger: All right.
Terry Flaa: So --
Mr. Sanger: Well, in any event, if LeGault was there -- in other words, you can't tell us for sure whether you heard directly from Klapakis or not. It may have gone through LeGault; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's exactly what I'm saying.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So when you said at the grand jury, “It was during that time that Lieutenant Klapakis had advised us that he contacted L.A. CPS”, that could have meant that Lieutenant Klapakis told you directly, or told Sergeant LeGault, or told both of you.
Terry Flaa: That's correct. However, I'm not reading -- I don't see what you just said.
Mr. Sanger: 1441, lines 12 through 14.
Terry Flaa: It could very well have been where Sergeant LeGault and I were together, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Now, the point of this --
Terry Flaa: I'm sure there's one.
Mr. Sanger: There is a point, I hope. The point of this is at some point, either directly through Klapakis or through LeGault, among the three of you at some point it was determined that the -- that you should interview these children, right.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And then at some point, Lieutenant Klapakis said he contacted Los Angeles CPS, right.
Terry Flaa: I was informed that he had contacted CPS, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And when we say “L.A. CPS”, we're really meaning L.A. DCFS, right.
Terry Flaa: Yes, we are.
Mr. Sanger: Those are kind of used interchangeably by Santa Barbarans.
Terry Flaa: I believe it's the same type of agency.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So the first point is, you were -- you were told that Lieutenant Klapakis contacted the L.A. DCFS, right.
Terry Flaa: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sanger: And you were told that he instructed them, or had them interview the children; is that what you were told.
Terry Flaa: I was -- I was told that he had submitted a request to them to interview the children.
Mr. Sanger: Now -- and then you found out that, in fact, they did interview the children.
Terry Flaa: I did, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Because that's what the DCFS worker read to you over the phone.
Terry Flaa: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Were you aware that Lieutenant Klapakis, in fact, called the DCFS supervisor and told her not to interview the children.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And, in fact, the DCFS supervisor said, “You're too late, we already did it”.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, after -- let me withdraw that. You -- you then relied upon the DCSF workers as to the contents of their interview with the children; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And you also relied upon them, as fellow professionals, to have done a fairly thorough job in interviewing the children; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That would have been my hope, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And, in fact, what they told you was very detailed. They had asked a lot of very detailed questions of the children and the mother, Janet Arvizo; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: I can only tell you what Brenda Blackburn informed me, what she read to me in that report. As far as what exact exchange occurred between the interviews and the children, I do not know. I was not present.
Mr. Sanger: I understand that. But as the lead investigator on this case involving Mr. Michael Jackson and these allegations, you were at that time concerned that there had been a thorough interview; is that right.
Terry Flaa: I was concerned that there had been.
Mr. Sanger: In other words -- in other words, if you had felt there wasn't a thorough interview, if you felt that, you know, they'd done a drive-by or got on the phone for a minute and said, “It's close enough”, you would have said, “No, that's not sufficient. We need to do a further interview, either they do or we do”, right.
Terry Flaa: Me personally, yes. But you have to understand, in this situation those decisions were not being made by me as the lead investigator. They were being made by my -- by Lieutenant Klapakis or the administration.
Mr. Sanger: Okay.
Terry Flaa: So I was informed that they had interviewed the children. She read me the content of what supposedly that interview -- what transpired during that interview. And we had to go on on -- based on that.
Mr. Sanger: Now, when you say “we had to go on that”, let's -- let's talk about that for a second.
Terry Flaa: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: You were the lead investigator in this case, correct.
Terry Flaa: I was the assigned investigator, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Assigned investigator. And in your department, you call it “assigned investigator”, is that --
Terry Flaa: “Lead investigator” is a term that's commonly used.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. “Lead investigator”. I just want to use the right words, okay. This will come up again, and we can spend less time with another witness if we just explore this.
Terry Flaa: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: As lead investigator, it's your understanding, in any case if you're lead investigator, you're responsible to collect all the evidence and make sure all the reports are written, and submit the case; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, you have a chain of command --
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- right. And in the chain of command at that particular time, in your direct chain of command, you had Sergeant LeGault and you had Lieutenant Klapakis, right.
Terry Flaa: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: The -- the people in the chain of command who are above you in the chain of command can give you instructions and orders; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: However, it is expected and was expected, in February, March and April of 2003, that any lead investigator on a case take full responsibility for evaluating the evidence and making appropriate recommendations; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And after you heard from Miss Blackburn -- let me withdraw that. You heard from Miss Blackburn that there were, in fact, three social workers who went to the home; is that right.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And that they talked to -- not only to Star Arvizo and Gavin Arvizo, but they talked to their sister Davellin, and they also talked to the mother, Janet; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And after you received that information, you then talked to the father of the children; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: That was David Arvizo.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And he told you that he had been subject to a restraining order, so he hadn't been able to talk with his children for a period of time; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: But he also said that he had been --
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to object as hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sanger: In general, he told you the background.
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to object as hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sanger: All right. It's not offered for the truth. It's offered with regard to his opinion.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sanger: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: In any event, after you talked to David Arvizo, did you make a recommendation to your superiors that any further investigation occur in this case.
Terry Flaa: That was the final conclusion, yes.
Mr. Sanger: The final conclusion was that no further investigation --
Terry Flaa: Correct. No further investigation.
Mr. Sanger: So you did not make a recommendation to your superiors that there be further investigation.
Terry Flaa: Not at that time, based on the information we had received.
Mr. Sanger: And, in fact, your conclusion in your report was that there was no criminal activity; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct. Mr. Sanger.
Mr. Sanger: Yes.
Terry Flaa: If I can clarify something. You kind of provided a broad time frame when you said February, March, April. And in fact -- and then you talked about that no crime occurred within that time frame. That's not what I'm stating, nor is that what my report states. It was as of the interview on February 20th. I cannot account for what happened, what may have been said by any of the Arvizos after the interview with DCFS.
Mr. Sanger: See, I was going to sit down, but now I have to ask you some more questions.
Terry Flaa: I'm sorry, I needed to clarify that, because that was a very broad three-month time frame.
Mr. Sanger: That's fine. You submitted your report April 16th; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: If I may look at the face page.
Mr. Sanger: Yes, please.
Terry Flaa: Yes, that's when I took it to the supervisor for approval.
Mr. Sanger: And the referral that you had, as an experienced child abuse investigator, the material you had suggested that a child abuse investigation be commenced; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And the information that you had from DCFS, you're telling us, was as of February 20th; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: The date of the interview.
Mr. Sanger: That was the --
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: That was the information you had from them. You understood it took place on February 20th.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then you had information March 13th from an interview with David Arvizo, correct.
Terry Flaa: I had spoken to Mr. Arvizo on that date, yes.
Mr. Sanger: So as of the -- as of the time that you submitted your report, you had no evidence of criminal activity; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Based on -- yes.
Mr. Sanger: I understand. But you were assigned the case, and if you thought there was some reason to investigate beyond the reports that you received from Miss Blackburn and Mr. Arvizo, you would have done that, right.
Terry Flaa: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Okay. I have no further questions. Thank you.
Mr. Zonen: Just a couple, Your Honor.
Message: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: Just a moment of clarification, if I could, Officer Flaa. There were two referrals that came in. And the first one you said you did no investigation on. That was the referral of which, please.
Terry Flaa: That was the referral where the reporting party indicated that they were aware of emotional abuse by Mr. Jackson toward his children.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Who handled that referral. Where did that one go to.
Mr. Sanger: Objection; calls for speculation.
Mr. Zonen: If he knows.
The Court: Well, he -- the foundation is sustained.
Mr. Zonen: All right.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know what becomes of different referrals; in other words, how they're distributed through the investigative bodies and agencies in Santa Barbara County.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Okay. And how are they distributed.
Terry Flaa: Well, a referral such as that, where there's no apparent criminal on the surface, and there's no criminal accusations per se, and it's an in-home abuse situation, would be referred out to Child Welfare Services, and they would assume jurisdictional responsibility for that type of investigation.
Mr. Zonen: And did that happen as to the first referral.
Terry Flaa: That I do not know.
Mr. Zonen: All right. But it was not a referral that went -- in other words, the copy that you received was simply a copy. This was a referral to Child Protective Services.
Terry Flaa: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Objection. Leading, Your Honor, and compound.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Tell us about the report that you received. Was it an original or was it a copy.
Terry Flaa: It was a copy.
Mr. Zonen: To whom was it addressed, then.
Terry Flaa: I don't know. It was given -- I was given a copy by Lieutenant Kla -- or Sergeant LeGault.
Mr. Zonen: In any event, your investigation was limited to the second referral.
Terry Flaa: Yes, sir.
Mr. Zonen: And that involved which children. Identify them, please.
Terry Flaa: Yes. Gavin Arvizo. Star Arvizo. And then - I know that I'm going to mispronounce this - Davelian, I believe it is. Davelian Arvizo.
Mr. Zonen: That's close.
Terry Flaa: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: All right. The dates that we're talking about, please, you already told us that it was the 20th when the interview was done in Los Angeles, the 20th of February, 2003. And the date that you said you had your conversation with Miss Blackburn was the 11th of March, 2003.
Terry Flaa: March 10th, 2003.
Mr. Zonen: I'm sorry, March 10th, 2003. When was it determined that the investigation would be closed.
Terry Flaa: After my conversation with Mr. Arvizo.
Mr. Zonen: And that was.
Terry Flaa: March 13th, 2003.
Mr. Zonen: And you had briefed your supervisor, Sergeant LeGault, of your findings; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And that included a copy of the -- tape-recorded copy of the conversation with Miss Blackburn.
Terry Flaa: Correct.
Mr. Zonen: Did we ever -- “we”. Did the sheriff's office ever receive, to your knowledge, while you were handling this matter, the actual written report of the Child Protective Services -- excuse me, the Department of Child & Family Services report that was generated in Los Angeles with regards to their interview of these two children, or three children.
Terry Flaa: Not that I'm aware of, no.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you. I have no further questions.
The Court: Mr. Sanger.
Message: RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: We've talked about this timeline. And again, we're starting with you here, so I'm going to ask you to take a look at a piece of paper. And with the Court's permission -- I'll give one to counsel here. With the Court's permission, I'd like to approach the witness and --
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sanger: Do you have a pen.
The Court: This is shown for refreshment of memory.
Mr. Sanger: No, what I'm going to do is ask that the piece of paper that I've given the witness be marked as defense next in order, which is 50 --
The Clerk: 34.
Mr. Sanger: 5034. And hopefully this will help avoid confusion, but we'll see.
Mr. Sanger: First of all, Officer, do you recognize that as being a timeline, just generally a linear calendar.
Terry Flaa: A blank timeline.
Mr. Sanger: Blank timeline, yes. And -- all right. What I'm going to do is just ask you -- Mr. Zonen was asking you some questions about the timing on --
Terry Flaa: Sure.
Mr. Sanger: -- redirect there. So let's just get it on paper. First of all, if you'd put your name up on the top. There's a line that says “Witness”. And then you can indicate on the timeline when you received your referral.
Terry Flaa: Circle the date.
Mr. Sanger: Yeah, just write, perhaps above it, just “Received Referral”. Whatever you -- whatever will help us to see this. And then you can circle the date and write above it the date that you understood the DCFS interview took place. You told us you understood that was on the 20th, I believe; is that right.
Terry Flaa: It was actually the same date that I got the --
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Then just put “DCFS Interview” as well. And then indicate the date that you contacted David Arvizo. And then just before that I think is the date you actually spoke to the DCFS supervisor, which I believe you said was on the 10th.
Terry Flaa: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And then I believe you indicated that there was a date that you found out that the Arvizo children had already been interviewed. I don't think you told us the date. But was that on 2-24.
Terry Flaa: Yes, it was.
Mr. Sanger: Why don't you just indicate that on there. And then off that particular chart, you have the date of April 16, which is the date you wrote your report; is that correct. That's off the chart, so it would be at the end. Would you just make a note, an arrow or something, and just put “4-16”. Is that chart now illustrative of your testimony. Does that work for you.
Terry Flaa: As far as the timeline, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Pretty much tell us about the timeline.
Terry Flaa: Yes, sir.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, in fact, perhaps Deputy Avila could just bring that back with her so I don't have to approach, if that's all right.
The Bailiff: I figured you were going to say that.
Mr. Zonen: May I see that, please.
Mr. Sanger: Certainly.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, I'd move this into evidence.
Mr. Zonen: No objection.
The Court: It's admitted.
Mr. Sanger: I'd like to publish it, if I could, please. Would Your Honor hit the --
The Court: We need “Input 4”, right.
Terry Flaa: Pardon my scribbling.
Mr. Sanger: Ah-hah, there's my hand. Oops.
Mr. Sanger: We have 5034 on the screen there. And somebody had a laser pointer, but I don't know where it is. But I think this is simple enough, and let's just do it this way: You've indicated there just what we went over. The date that you got the request, or the referral, on the 20th of February, 2003, which is also, it turns out coincidentally, to be the date of the DCFS interviews, correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then you were told of -- actually, I can't read it. What's on the 24th.
Terry Flaa: It says, “Detective Flaa” -- excuse me, “Detective Flaa learned of the interview”, or the DCSF interviews.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you. That's when you learned of the interviews. And on the 10th of March, that's when you basically were read the interviews by Miss Blackburn; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then the 13th is when you did your interview with Mr. David Arvizo, correct.
Terry Flaa: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then down at the bottom, it's off the chart, but 4-16-03 is when you submitted your report; is that correct.
Terry Flaa: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Thank you. I have no further questions.
Mr. Zonen: I have no questions, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. Thank you. You may step down.
Terry Flaa: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Zonen: We'll call Lieutenant Klapakis to the stand.
The Court: When you get to the witness stand, remain standing. Face the clerk and raise your right hand.
Message: JEFF KLAPAKIS Having been sworn, testified as follows:
Jeff Klapakis: I do.
The Clerk: Please be seated. State and spell your name for the record.
Jeff Klapakis: My name is Jeff Klapakis. It's K-l-a, P as in Paul, a-k-i-s.
The Clerk: Thank you.
Mr. Zonen: May I proceed.
The Court: Yes.
Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. ZONEN:
Mr. Zonen: Sir, what is your current occupation.
Jeff Klapakis: I'm a lieutenant with the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office.
Mr. Zonen: What is your responsibilities, your current assignment.
Jeff Klapakis: I am in charge of the Criminal Investigations Bureau within the North County of Santa Barbara.
Mr. Zonen: We have to admonish everybody that that microphone has to be pretty close to your mouth to be heard anywhere, if you would, please.
Jeff Klapakis: Okay.
Mr. Zonen: What does that mean. What are your actual assignments and responsibilities. What do you do as part of your job.
Jeff Klapakis: Any reports of criminal activity are sent to my bureau, and they are sent out to detectives to further investigate them.
Mr. Zonen: And who works under you. Who do you supervise.
Jeff Klapakis: I supervise sergeants, who then supervise other detectives.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Were you involved in any of the decisions regarding the referrals that came in back in February 2003 regarding Mr. Jackson, specifically involving children of the Arvizo family, as well as the second referral involving his own children.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: What was your involvement in that.
Jeff Klapakis: I received the referrals and contacted our local office of the Child Protective Services, in hopes of making contact with the Los Angeles office of Child Protective Services, which I believe is called DCFS.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Was this assigned to an investigator.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And who was the investigator.
Jeff Klapakis: Detective Flaa.
Mr. Zonen: Do you know when that investigation took place.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes. It was around the second or third week of February. I believe it was February 18th or the 20th, somewhere in there.
Mr. Zonen: Did you at any time place a telephone call to any agency, child protective agency, specifically in Los Angeles.
Jeff Klapakis: Well, I first contacted Lompoc, in hopes of getting in touch with Los Angeles.
Mr. Zonen: Why Lompoc.
Jeff Klapakis: Well, they were our local office. We had worked with them before in similar-type cases. The referrals indicated that the potential person involved in the referral lived in Los Angeles, so I thought that might be the more prudent action.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Let me ask it again. I'm not sure I understand. Why Lompoc. If the person lived in Los Angeles, why did you contact the Lompoc office as opposed to the Santa Maria office or Santa Barbara office.
Jeff Klapakis: Well, I thought that they would have contact numbers for them. They may know some people that we could contact. And much like I would call a law enforcement agency, having contact with them, that's why I chose to go through them first.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And was that before or after you assigned Detective Flaa to this investigation.
Jeff Klapakis: That was before.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Did you contact Child Protective Services in Los Angeles at all. Did you have any communication with them.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes, I believe I did. Sometime after the 20th.
Mr. Zonen: Did you at any time instruct them that they should not interview the Arvizo children.
Jeff Klapakis: I actually made that call to Lompoc CPS and hoped -- because I had not gotten a phone number for L.A. at that point in time. We're talking about a period of a couple of days.
Mr. Zonen: Okay.
Jeff Klapakis: And I was -- I believe that was on February 20th.
Mr. Zonen: All right.
Jeff Klapakis: At about eleven o'clock.
Mr. Zonen: All right. So the question specifically is, did you tell somebody in some child protective organization not to interview the children.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: Who was the organization.
Jeff Klapakis: Lompoc.
Mr. Zonen: Why did you instruct them accordingly.
Jeff Klapakis: At that point in time, I had discussed it with Detective Flaa and then Sergeant LeGault, and we felt it would be more prudent for us to go down and conduct the interview ourself.
Mr. Zonen: All right. It was in deference to your doing the interview or you having one of your detectives doing the interview.
Jeff Klapakis: Right.
Mr. Zonen: At some point in time, did you make the determination or did somebody from your office make the determination not to do an interview at all.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes, I did.
Mr. Zonen: And when was that decision made.
Jeff Klapakis: After Detective Flaa had contacted the Los Angeles office of the DCFS and was able to extract their information on their investigation, that they had closed their investigation.
Mr. Zonen: Were you familiar, or were you made familiar with the information that was furnished to Detective Flaa by the Child Protective Services agency in Los Angeles.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes, I was.
Mr. Zonen: Did he actually tape-record that conversation.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Did you listen to that tape-recording.
Jeff Klapakis: I read the transcript, I believe.
Mr. Zonen: A transcript was prepared at that time.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Are we still talking back in February and March of 2003.
Jeff Klapakis: It was March 2003.
Mr. Zonen: All right. So you became aware of that interview in its entirety, the interview between Detective Flaa and Brenda Blackburn of the Department of Child Family Services in Los Angeles.
Jeff Klapakis: That's correct.
Mr. Zonen: The two different names has plagued us from the beginning of this case, hasn't it.
Jeff Klapakis: Right.
Mr. Zonen: When was it that you made the determination -- strike that. Were you the one who made the determination not to pursue an investigation any further.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. When was that decision made.
Jeff Klapakis: After we had talked with Miss Blackburn, and also after I instructed Detective Flaa to contact the estranged father of the boy.
Mr. Zonen: And his name is.
Jeff Klapakis: David Arvizo.
Mr. Zonen: All right. At some point in time was this investigation reactivated.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: All right. Without getting into the detail of the conversations, what was the event that caused it to be reactivated.
Jeff Klapakis: I received a phone call from Larry Feldman.
Mr. Zonen: All right. And did that cause you to pursue other investigation at that point.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: Was an investigative team assembled at that time.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And who was the lead investigator selected at that time.
Jeff Klapakis: Sergeant Steve Robel.
Mr. Zonen: When was that done, do you recall. The conversation with Larry Feldman.
Jeff Klapakis: I believe it was late June or early July 2003.
Mr. Zonen: Did Mr. Feldman tell you why he was contacting you.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Zonen: And what did he say.
Jeff Klapakis: He indicated that the young boy and his brother had talked to a Dr. Katz in Los Angeles, and that they had made some --
Mr. Sanger: I'm going to object to a narrative, and it's calling for hearsay.
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to withdraw the question and rephrase it.
The Court: I'll sustain the objection and strike the answer.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you.
Mr. Zonen: Did you refer him at any time to Child Protective Services - Mr. Feldman.
Jeff Klapakis: I don't believe so.
Mr. Zonen: Did he indicate to you that he had contacted Child Protective Services.
Mr. Sanger: That would call for hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Zonen: Did he tell you who referred you to him -- who referred him to you.
Jeff Klapakis: Mr. Sneddon.
Mr. Zonen: Thank you. I have no further questions.
The Court: Cross-examine.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: Lieutenant, how are you.
Jeff Klapakis: Fine, sir.
Mr. Sanger: You originally -- let me withdraw that. You said you had called the Lompoc CPS, Child Protective Services, right.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And is that the Child Protective Services office that would have jurisdiction over the Santa Ynez Valley.
Jeff Klapakis: I believe so.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Mr. Jackson, Michael Jackson, my client, has a ranch in Santa Ynez Valley; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you were aware of that at the time; is that right.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Did you discuss with the CPS people in Lompoc doing an investigation of either of the suspected child abuse reports that came from Los Angeles.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes, I believe we did discuss the referrals.
Mr. Sanger: So there were two referrals, right.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: We're going to refer to the first one. Not that they have any priority, I suppose. But the first one was a referral in which the reporting party was Carol Lieberman; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: I believe that was the first one.
Mr. Sanger: And you are aware that Carol Lieberman was a psychologist who was getting a lot of time on television around that time; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: I wasn't aware of her prior to receiving the referral.
Mr. Sanger: After you received the referral, did you make that determination, that she had been becoming a television personality over complaints about Michael Jackson.
Jeff Klapakis: Well, I believe the referral indicated that she planned to have a news conference.
Mr. Sanger: In fact, she did.
Jeff Klapakis: I'm unaware of that.
Mr. Sanger: She was even alerting everybody that she was going to have -- on a particular date - I think it was a day or two after - she was going to have a news conference, right.
Mr. Zonen: I'm going to object as assuming facts not in evidence and lack of foundation.
Mr. Sanger: I'll withdraw it. We can look at the report if that would help.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. The report indicated that actually Miss Lieberman, the next day, the following day, the day following her report, intended to have a press conference; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: I believe that's what it indicates. I'm not looking at it right now.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. You're welcome to do that. I can show you a copy of that.
Jeff Klapakis: I believe I have one.
Mr. Sanger: Do you have it.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Please take a look.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes, it does say the next day.
Mr. Sanger: All right. All right. And how long have you been a sheriff.
Jeff Klapakis: 25 years.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And without going into all the detail, you went to the academy.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Which academy.
Jeff Klapakis: Allan Hancock.
Mr. Sanger: All right. You got a good education there; is that right.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you've had a lot of inservice training since then; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you've investigated suspected child abuse reports on many occasions in your career as a deputy sheriff and as a detective and eventually on up the ladder; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Primary aspects of it, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you're well aware that the nature of the report, including the who the reporting party is, is a significant factor to evaluate in a suspected child abuse case; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: I believe you take the totality of any circumstances.
Mr. Sanger: But specifically the RP, an RP can have an agenda, right.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes, they can.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And in the second report, there's also reference to Gloria Allred; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: That same report.
Mr. Sanger: The second suspected child abuse report from L.A. DCFS.
Jeff Klapakis: Are you referring to the one that the reporting party was a Mr. Tash.
Mr. Sanger: That's correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes. She's -- she's mentioned in that.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And you're aware that Gloria Allred is an L.A. lawyer who spends a lot of time on television, correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes, I'm aware of Miss Allred.
Mr. Sanger: And from your understanding of these reports, none of the reporting parties had any personal knowledge of Michael Jackson or his involvement with his own children or other children; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Personal knowledge, no.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, do you know if Santa Barbara Child Protective Services, that being evidently the Lompoc CPS office, do you know if they did anything to follow up on an investigation of either one of these reports.
Jeff Klapakis: I believe that when they received the referral, and I believe it was the first one, they sent it to L.A. DCFS, because the -- the boy lived in Los Angeles.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, the first referral, though, was with regard to -- from Carol Lieberman was with regard to Mr. Jackson and his own children; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: I'm sorry, maybe I have that mistaken. It's -- one of them, I think that they made contact with -- with L.A. because -- probably after the second one.
Mr. Sanger: So the first report -- just based on what you were telling Mr. Zonen, the first report would be within their jurisdiction if there was anything there to investigate; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Santa Barbara County.
Mr. Sanger: Yes.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes, it would, based on where Mr. Jackson lives.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And if there was any criminal activity related to that first report, that would be within the jurisdiction of the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department, particularly your office in Santa Maria for the North County; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, I do want to try to clear up one point here. I think you said that you asked the Lompoc CPS office not to interview Star and Gavin Arvizo.
Jeff Klapakis: My recollection is, is that I made contact with Lompoc to either give me a number to contact Los Angeles or to pass the request to Los Angeles. But I was advised that I was too late.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Do you recall speaking directly with Miss Blackburn in Los Angeles and asking her not to interview the children.
Jeff Klapakis: I'm not -- it's possible that I did talk to Miss Blackburn in person, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Do you recall her telling you, “It's too late. We already interviewed them”.
Jeff Klapakis: I am -- I did receive that information. Who I received it from, I can't tell you right now.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. All right. Now, in your experience as a -- an investigator or detective and eventually, can we say, an administrator, or is that not a good thing to say.
Jeff Klapakis: That's fair.
Mr. Sanger: So in your experience as a lieutenant and everywhere on the way up, you understood this to be a sensitive case; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you understood -- you understood it to be potentially a big case, significant case, correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: When -- when Detective Flaa concluded his investigation, did he inform you that it was his opinion that no further investigation was necessary.
Jeff Klapakis: I believe that we collaborated on it, discussing it, yes.
Mr. Sanger: So you talked with him.
Jeff Klapakis: And Sergeant LeGault.
Mr. Sanger: And Sergeant LeGault.
Jeff Klapakis: Right.
Mr. Sanger: So basically all three of you agreed that no further investigation was necessary in this case.
Jeff Klapakis: Based on the information that we had received from Miss Blackburn, our assumption of that investigation and as well as our interview of David Arvizo, that was the decision I made, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Just by the way, this may not be significant, but evidently there's a Sergeant Kooperman.
Jeff Klapakis: Koopmann.
Mr. Sanger: Koopmann. I do that all the time, I'm sorry. A Sergeant Koopmann who was supposed to sign off on some of these reports in this case, and you signed your name over his typed name. Are you aware of that.
Jeff Klapakis: Sergeant Koopmanns replaced Sergeant LeGault around the July time period.
Mr. Sanger: I see.
Jeff Klapakis: He was also on vacation when this began.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Well, let's go back a little bit, because if I understand your testimony, after this was closed, this case was closed on April the 16th, there's a report, is that correct, April 16th, two thousand --
Jeff Klapakis: I don't have that report with me, but that's about right.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And the case was closed, as far as you were concerned, that was it; is that right.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. The same case with the same case number was reopened --
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- in June; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: I believe it was around that time period, right.
Mr. Sanger: And that's the time that you got a call from Tom Sneddon, Mr. Sneddon, correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And he told you he had received a telephone call from Attorney Larry Feldman; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Did you speak directly with Attorney Larry Feldman yourself.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Now, at that time in June, and if you need something to refresh your recollection, but I believe it was about June 13th -- does that sound right, or do you need -- or is there something you could look at.
Jeff Klapakis: I believe that's possibly correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Sometime around that -- in any event, in June of 2003, can we agree to that.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. June of 2003, you received a call from Mr. Sneddon, eventually talked to Attorney Larry Feldman, and then you reopened the investigation, correct.
Jeff Klapakis: After speaking with Mr. Feldman, no, I made another phone call before I --
Mr. Sanger: To.
Jeff Klapakis: Dr. Katz.
Mr. Sanger: To Dr. Katz, okay. So you talked to -- and you were aware that Dr. Katz was a forensic psychologist, correct.
Jeff Klapakis: A child psychologist, I believe. But --
Mr. Sanger: Were you aware --
Jeff Klapakis: A psychologist.
Mr. Sanger: Were you aware he's a forensic psychologist.
Jeff Klapakis: I believe that -- yes, I believe he was a psychologist, and I believe he specializes in interviewing children, but that's -- it's been a long time since I've talked to Dr. Katz.
Mr. Sanger: Well, you know what a forensic psychologist is, correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Somebody who testifies in court; somebody who helps prepare cases.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Were you aware that he was a forensic psychologist.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you were aware that he had worked with Attorney Feldman in the past, or not.
Jeff Klapakis: I don't believe I was aware of that when I talked to Dr. Katz initially. I know that now.
Mr. Sanger: Eventually you found that out, all right. So Attorney Feldman, Dr. Katz, Mr. Sneddon, not in that order, but you have those phone calls, and then you reopen your investigation; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you use the same case number, correct.
Jeff Klapakis: I believe we did.
Mr. Sanger: Now, why didn't you just call Detective Flaa and tell him, “Your case is reopened. New things have come up. Let's investigate”.
Jeff Klapakis: Detective Flaa was no longer working for us. He had left our agency.
Mr. Sanger: You believe he left your agency at that time.
Jeff Klapakis: Well, excuse me. I'm sorry. He had left my bureau and went to work for special operations.
Mr. Sanger: Now, it's very common when somebody leaves a particular bureau or assignment, if a big case they're working on reopens, it's very common to bring that officer back or that detective back to continue with the investigation, is it not.
Jeff Klapakis: Well, it depends on how -- how much investigation had occurred up to that point.
Mr. Sanger: Is it common or not, sir. It's common, isn't it.
Jeff Klapakis: Well, no.
Mr. Sanger: Never happens. Sometimes happens.
Jeff Klapakis: Sometimes happens.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And Sergeant LeGault was replaced by Sergeant Robel; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: On this investigation.
Mr. Sanger: Yes. When you reopened it.
Jeff Klapakis: Well, he wasn't -- he was made the lead investigator of this agency, of this -- Sergeant Koopmanns was -- basically had replaced Sergeant LeGault.
Mr. Sanger: So you brought a Sergeant in, Sergeant Robel.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. The prior line-up was you, Sergeant LeGault and Detective Flaa, right.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And now the line-up was you, Sergeant Koopmanns --
Jeff Klapakis: Sergeant Koopmanns was not involved in this case.
Mr. Sanger: I'm sorry. He replaced LeGault or he didn't.
Jeff Klapakis: He replaced LeGault.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. But he didn't end up -- other than having his name on some things where you signed over it, he really didn't get involved in it; is that right.
Jeff Klapakis: That's correct. Sometimes there's an innocuous reason why they'll put -- I had investigators working for me out of different offices at times, and sometimes they will just put their Sergeant's name as the person reviewing it, even though in our department any superior can review a report.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. But Koopmann -- I don't want to spend lot of time on this, but Koopmanns' name was actually in there as a sergeant reviewing the report, and then you would sign your name over it.
Jeff Klapakis: If I signed my name over it, it doesn't mean that Sergeant Koopmanns reviewed the report.
Mr. Sanger: Does that mean you reviewed the report.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: There you go. In any event, now we have you; we still have Sergeant LeGault, or not.
Jeff Klapakis: No.
Mr. Sanger: No.
Jeff Klapakis: Are -- you're talking July '03, right.
Mr. Sanger: Yeah, June, July '03.
Jeff Klapakis: No.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So we had you; then Sergeant Robel.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then you had Paul Zelis.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And Paul Zelis was the detective who really took over Detective Flaa's role in this, did he not.
Jeff Klapakis: No, actually I believe Sergeant Robel took over that role.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And Detective Zelis was not as experienced a detective as some of the other people you had working under you was.
Jeff Klapakis: That's an accurate description.
Mr. Sanger: He had been a deputy marshal; is that right.
Jeff Klapakis: He had been a deputy marshal before, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Deputy marshals were the bailiffs for the Municipal Court when we used to have Municipal Courts here.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then when we consolidated the courts into Superior Court, the marshals, many of them, became sheriffs; is that correct.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And that's how he became a sheriff.
Jeff Klapakis: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And Detective Zelis was the one who -- we don't want to go into a lot of detail here, but Detective Zelis was the detective who did a lot of the interviews, is that correct, in this case.
Jeff Klapakis: He participated in those interviews with Sergeant Robel.
Mr. Sanger: And he's the one who is the declarant, or the affiant, for the search warrants. He did a big, long, 80-page affidavit to get search warrants.
Jeff Klapakis: He is the affiant of the search warrant. Of the primary search warrant, I should say.
Mr. Sanger: He was at the search at Neverland.
Jeff Klapakis: He was one of many, yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. I have no further questions.
Mr. Zonen: Nor do I, Your Honor.
The Court: You may step down. Call your next witness.
Mr. Sneddon: Sergeant Robel, would you take the stand, please.
The Court: Sergeant Robel, you're already under oath, so when you get to the witness stand, you may be seated.
Steve Robel: Thank you.
Message: STEVE ROBEL Having been previously sworn, resumed the stand and testified further as follows:
Message: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. SNEDDON:
Mr. Sneddon: Sergeant Robel, you've been previously sworn, and you understand you're still under oath.
Steve Robel: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, first of all, let's go back a little bit, because we're going to broaden the scope of your testimony just a little bit. Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury a little bit about your background and preparation for becoming a deputy sheriff.
Steve Robel: Sure. Approximately 22 years ago, I went to the Ventura academy.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry, but we're going to have to tell you what we did all the other kids in the case. Speak into it, please.
Steve Robel: Approximately 22 ago I went to the police academy down in Ventura. And it was approximately 14, 15 weeks long. I was then placed in Solvang, Santa Ynez, where I was -- I worked as a deputy on patrol and worked my way up. I was the DARE officer and school resource officer. And then I went on into detectives. And during that time in detectives, I was specializing in sexual assault and child abuse cases.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's stop there for just a second. How long did you actually work in the specialty of child abuse and sexual assault cases for children.
Steve Robel: Approximately five years.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you have any special training or preparation for that role as a detective on those kinds of sensitive cases.
Steve Robel: Yes, I have.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Would you explain that to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please.
Steve Robel: Yes, I've had numerous hours of education through forensic interviewing, which was approximately 80 hours. Child abuse and recognition training, which was approximately 40 hours. I ended up actually giving some training courses in forensic interviewing classes, assisting other agencies in that respect. I've also -- excuse me just for a second. I got to refer to my notes here. Interviewing -- child abuse interviewing techniques with children. And also an 80-hour sexual assault investigation course.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, I'm going to object for a moment to the witness interviewing (sic) his notes, and -- I don't think there was a basis for it, but also I don't believe I've seen those notes. If I could have an opportunity to look at them, I would appreciate it.
The Court: All right. You may approach the witness.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you, Your Honor.
The Court: Your objection was he was looking at notes without --
Mr. Sanger: Without an adequate foundation.
The Court: Without a foundation. Is that objection still being made after looking at the notes.
Mr. Sanger: Well, I'll withdraw it as to that question, but I would in the future make the same objection.
The Court: All right. Did we finish that question.
Mr. Sneddon: I believe I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Were you finished telling them about your training and expertise in that area.
Steve Robel: Yes, I am.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Sergeant Robel, at some point in time were you assigned as the lead investigator into the case against the defendant in this case, Michael Jackson.
Steve Robel: Yes, I was.
Mr. Sneddon: And approximately, if you recall, what time was it that you were assigned that particular responsibility.
Steve Robel: I want to say I believe it was around the middle -- around the 20th or so of June of 2003.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at that time, who was the person that you were reporting directly to.
Steve Robel: That was Lieutenant Jeff Klapakis.
Mr. Sneddon: The previous witness.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And was Paul Zelis, Detective Zelis, a part of that particular investigative team.
Steve Robel: Yes, he was.
Mr. Sneddon: And did he work under your supervision.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, at some point did you participate in an interview of the members of the Arvizo family.
Steve Robel: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, when was the first occasion that you interviewed the Arvizo family.
Steve Robel: I believe it was on July 7th of 2003.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, when I said “members of the Arvizo family”, what -- what individuals within that family do you recall having interviews with.
Steve Robel: Janet Arvizo, Star Arvizo, Gavin Arvizo, and Davellin Arvizo.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, the ladies and gentlemen of the jury have heard testimony previously this morning - actually, I guess you have too, most of the time you were here - about the fact that there was a report that Detective Flaa had obtained about the interview between the Los Angeles social workers and the Arvizo family. Do you recall that.
Steve Robel: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, prior to the time that you interviewed the family in July of 2003, were you familiar with the contents of that report.
Steve Robel: I was familiar with Detective Flaa's report. I read that. And also Detective Zelis's phone review of Dr. Katz.
Mr. Sneddon: So you were familiar with both of those before you actually interviewed the family.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And were you familiar with the fact that as a result of the interview with the Los Angeles social workers back on February 20th of 2003, that your department had conducted an initial investigation.
Steve Robel: Yes. After reading the report, I did conclude that, yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And that it had been closed.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, did you conduct an interview with -- or when did you conduct the first interview that you had with Star Arvizo. Do you recall exactly what date that was.
Steve Robel: I believe it was Monday, July 7th.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall where that was.
Steve Robel: 2003. That was conducted in Santa Barbara County, at our common interview place in Santa Barbara.
Mr. Sneddon: So would that be in the south part of the county.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Was that interview tape-recorded, or videotape-recorded.
Steve Robel: Yes, it was.
Mr. Sneddon: And was a transcription of that tape-recording made.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And you've had a chance to review both of those.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to Star Arvizo's interview - okay --.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- during the course of that interview, how many incidents did Star tell you in which he was standing on the stairs that he saw Michael Jackson molest his brother Gavin.
Steve Robel: Two.
Mr. Sneddon: During that interview on July 7th of 2003, did Star make statements to you about describing a third incident that he had seen involving the defendant, Michael Jackson, and his brother Gavin.
Steve Robel: Yes, he did.
Mr. Sneddon: And what did he say in that connection.
Steve Robel: He told me --
Mr. Sanger: Objection. Objection; hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, it's a prior consistent statement. It's admissible under the Evidence Code. Counsel has -- I won't say anything else, but I --
The Court: Let me think for a moment.
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah.
The Court: Counsel approach, please. (Discussion held off the record at sidebar.)
The Court: All right. The objection is overruled. You may --
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Let's go back just a second, Sergeant Robel. You had a videotaped conversation with Star Arvizo on July 7th of 2003, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And in that conversation, Star Arvizo indicated to you that he had seen two incidents while standing on the stairwell where he saw the defendant, Michael Jackson, molest his brother Gavin, correct.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the course of that conversation, did Star Arvizo relate to you a third incident in which he had seen the defendant in this case, Michael Jackson, touch his brother inappropriately.
Steve Robel: Yes, he did.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what he told you.
Steve Robel: Star told me that when he was up in Michael's bedroom, he was lying on what he described as a couch-type setting, possibly a futon, and he was -- pretended like he was sleeping. And Michael came up into the bedroom and crawled into bed where his brother Gavin was sleeping. And when he got into bed, he scooted up next to him, Mr. Jackson did, to Gavin, and started moving back and forth. And Star observed that, and he basically pretended like he was sleeping at that time.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, during the time that you were doing these interviews, did you also have an interview with Gavin Arvizo.
Steve Robel: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: And what date did that occur.
Steve Robel: That was -- that would also have been on Monday, July 7th, 2003.
Mr. Sneddon: And would that have been at the same location.
Steve Robel: Yes, it was.
Mr. Sneddon: And during this conversation, who else was present besides you and Gavin.
Steve Robel: It would have been Detective Zelis.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to the previous interview with Star, was Detective Zelis present then also.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, in the conversation that you had with Gavin Arvizo on the 7th of July of 2003, did Gavin -- excuse me. Sorry, Counsel.
Mr. Sanger: That's all right.
Mr. Sneddon: Did Gavin Arvizo indicate to you the time frame as to when he thought that he had been molested by the defendant in this case, Mr. Jackson.
Steve Robel: Yes, he did.
Mr. Sneddon: And what did he tell you.
Steve Robel: He told me it was towards the end of his stay at Neverland.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, after that interview on July 7, did you have another interview with Gavin Arvizo.
Steve Robel: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: And when did that occur.
Steve Robel: I believe that was August 13th of 2003.
Mr. Sneddon: And in that interview, did the subject of the timing of when Mr. Jackson molested him come up.
Steve Robel: Yes, it did.
Mr. Sneddon: And what did he indicate to you on that occasion.
Steve Robel: Again, he stated that it was towards the end of his stay at Neverland.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Let's shift gears here for a second. I need to grab some water. Okay. In November of 2003, you were part of a number of people who executed a search warrant on Neverland Valley Ranch, correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And do you remember what date that was.
Steve Robel: I believe it was November 18th, 2003.
Mr. Sneddon: And were you, as the lead investigator, involved in overseeing the preparation of the affidavit in support of the search warrant that was eventually submitted to the Judge to get authorization for that search warrant.
Steve Robel: Yes, I was.
Mr. Sneddon: And in that connection, did you have a recommendation or a desire with regard to how long you thought the search of the ranch would take.
Steve Robel: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sanger: I'm going to object; relevance. His state of mind.
The Court: Well, the objection's sustained, because you said “recommendation or a desire”.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. I'll rephrase it. It's compound.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to the length of the time that you thought that the search would take at Neverland Valley Ranch, what was your desire with regard to requesting judicial authorization as to the time frame.
Mr. Sanger: I'm going to object again. Relevance.
The Court: Overruled. I'm going to -- you know, “desire” is the word that bothers me here. If you had a recommendation, that's what I would like to hear, as opposed to his private desires.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, okay. It's probably a bad choice of words, then.
Mr. Sneddon: In your conversations -- let me ask you this: Who was the attorney you were dealing with in the preparation of the affidavit for the search warrant.
Steve Robel: It would have been Tom Sneddon.
Mr. Sneddon: Me.
Steve Robel: Yeah.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And in the course of working with me on that document, the affidavit in support of the search warrant, did you have a recommendation that you made with regard to the length of time that you wanted to be on the ranch to execute that warrant.
Mr. Sanger: Objection. Calls for hearsay and relevance.
The Court: Well, what is the relevance, Counsel.
Mr. Sneddon: Judge, the relevance is the amount of people that it took to do it, because --
The Court: All right. I'll overrule the objection.
Mr. Sneddon: What was your -- what was your request and recommendation.
Steve Robel: I was requesting that we have authorization to be on the ranch for two to three days.
Mr. Sneddon: And was that request granted.
Steve Robel: No, it was not.
Mr. Sneddon: Who denied it.
Steve Robel: You did.
Mr. Sneddon: And what did I tell you in that connection.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, I'm going to object to that. That calls for hearsay. And I'm going to move to strike the prior questions and answers on the ground that this is not relevant.
The Court: The objection as to hearsay is sustained.
Mr. Sneddon: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: In any case, when the warrant went to the Judge for signature, the warrant provided for how long that you could be on the property.
Steve Robel: I believe it was approximately 24 hours or till midnight, I believe, of that day.
Mr. Sneddon: Midnight of the day you executed it.
Steve Robel: Correct. I believe it was midnight we had to be out.
Mr. Sneddon: What was the impact of the shorter time frame than you requested on the decisions of how the execution -- how the warrant was executed on the ranch that day.
Steve Robel: Well, it caused us to reevaluate our initial plan and how many personnel that we were going to take onto the ranch, which in turn caused us to bring more personnel in order to get the job done within the parameters of time that we were designated.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, do you know an attorney by the name of Jerry Franklin.
Steve Robel: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: Who's Mr. Franklin.
Steve Robel: He's a Senior Deputy D.A. with Santa Barbara County.
Mr. Sneddon: Was Mr. Franklin on the ranch that day, the day that the warrant was executed.
Steve Robel: Yes, he was.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you, in your capacity as the lead investigator, have some interactions with Mr. Franklin that day.
Steve Robel: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: And in what connection was that.
Steve Robel: On two separate occasions, he assisted me in doing an addendum to a search warrant in the Los Angeles area, and also he assisted -- I had him assist Detective Zelis on doing an addendum for a search on a certain or particular item on the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you know how long Mr. Franklin was there that day.
Steve Robel: I want to say he was approximately there maybe four or five hours, somewhere along that line.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, it's been indicated in the beginning of your testimony that I was on the ranch that day; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you recall how long I was there or when I left.
Mr. Sanger: I'm going to object. Lack of foundation.
The Court: The answer -- the objection is overruled. But answer “yes” or “no”. Do you recall how long he was there.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: How long.
Steve Robel: I think you left probably around 1:30 or 2:00 in the afternoon.
The Court: All right. Let's take our break.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: I don't know if everybody knows, but we had a little longer break this morning, because the Olive Garden read a CNN report that basically said the jurors were starving to death. (Laughter.)
The Court: And they have to thank CNN because Olive Garden sent over a bunch of pizzas, so the jury has been -- they sent out an attack squadron and threatened my life if I wouldn't let them eat the pizzas, so they're -- they've -- they're all full, and --
A Juror: Oh, yeah.
The Court: Let me tell you the danger here now. Having been a Judge for many years, this is the best advice I can give anybody on a jury, and that is: Don't eat too much at lunch. But today it's okay. Counsel.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Sergeant Robel, I think we were at the point that you're at the ranch, and you're executing a search warrant on November the 18th, 2003. Okay.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, during the course of the execution of that search warrant, did you personally seize any items that were booked into evidence.
Steve Robel: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: And in what room was that that you did that.
Steve Robel: It was in Mr. Jackson's.
Mr. Sneddon: Michael Jackson's.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And what room.
Steve Robel: His master bedroom.
Mr. Sneddon: Would that be downstairs or upstairs.
Steve Robel: It would be upstairs.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, could you just describe to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what process that you used in seizing the evidence and then making sure that it got booked appropriately.
Steve Robel: We had a designated person downstairs with a laptop computer that was the person that was documenting the items on a property form and giving it an item number, a sheriff's department item number. As seizers, we would seize stuff and then we would actually hand-carry it down to him, and then he would actually go on ahead and it would be packaged up and entered into the computer and given an item number.
Mr. Sneddon: All right, Your Honor. I have four more exhibits I'd like to have marked for identification purposes. And I've shown them to counsel. They're Photos 278, a Photo 84, and a Photo 283 and 284.
The Court: Thank you. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Sergeant Robel, let's do it in this order. I'm going take them back. But with regard to the Photograph 278, do you recognize that.
Steve Robel: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that an accurate depiction of what it purports to represent.
Steve Robel: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And turn over the next one, if you would. Turn that over, if you would. And the next one is 84. Do you recognize that.
Steve Robel: I do.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that an accurate depiction of what it purports to represent.
Steve Robel: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you turn that over. And with regard to the next item, which is 284, do you recognize that.
Steve Robel: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that an accurate depiction of what it purports to represent.
Steve Robel: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Would you turn that over, please. And I believe the other one is 283.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that an accurate depiction of what it purports to represent.
Steve Robel: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sneddon: And are these items that you saw during the course of your execution of the search warrant at Neverland Valley Ranch.
Steve Robel: Yes, they are.
Mr. Sneddon: And are items that you seized.
Steve Robel: Yes, they are.
Mr. Sneddon: I move that these be admitted into evidence.
Mr. Sanger: I would object. I would object, Your Honor, on the grounds that there is no foundation, particularly as to the relevance of these particular items to these proceedings.
The Court: I haven't seen the pictures.
Mr. Sneddon: May I come around this way, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Should I approach as well.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you. (Discussion held off the record at sidebar.)
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to give you these back for just a second, and I'm going to ask you a couple more questions, and then we'll.... Sergeant Robel, with regard to the photograph that's on the top, which is -- what's the number on that.
Steve Robel: 278.
Mr. Sneddon: 278. Do you recognize that photograph.
Steve Robel: I do.
Mr. Sneddon: And what does that photograph depict.
Steve Robel: It's a cardboard box that's open, and it has various magazines in it.
Mr. Sneddon: Have you ever seen that cardboard box before.
Steve Robel: Yes, I have.
Mr. Sneddon: Where did you see it.
Steve Robel: In Mr. Jackson's upstairs portion of his master bedroom, at the base of his bed.
Mr. Sneddon: Does that photograph accurately depict the condition of that cardboard box the first time you looked inside of it.
Steve Robel: Yes, it does.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. With regard to the next photograph, which is No. 84 I believe --
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: -- is that correct.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to Photograph 84, do you recognize that photograph.
Steve Robel: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: And there is displayed in that photograph a magazine on top, correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And does that photograph accurately depict the location of that photograph -- that magazine the first time you saw it inside that box.
Steve Robel: Yes, it does.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Turn that one over, if you would. With regard to -- is that 284.
Steve Robel: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sneddon: With regard to 284, that photograph depicts a book, correct.
Steve Robel: Yes, it does.
Mr. Sneddon: Where was that book the first time you saw it.
Steve Robel: That was inside the cardboard box.
Mr. Sneddon: The one that's depicted in the Photograph 284 -- in No. 84.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sneddon: And did you seize that item.
Steve Robel: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. And the next one is 283.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to what's depicted in that photograph, 283, where was that item the first time you saw it.
Steve Robel: That was also inside the cardboard box.
Mr. Sneddon: It's depicted in the Photograph 84 and 278.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Your Honor, ask permission at this point to -- that they be admitted and I can question the witness about them.
Mr. Sanger: I'd renew my objection, Your Honor.
The Court: I'll sustain the objection. The -- there's no connection to the present case with the photographs.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm sorry, Your Honor, I didn't hear what you said.
The Court: There's no connection to the present case with that material.
Mr. Sneddon: May we approach the bench for a second, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, may I display them with your permission.
The Court: Yes. The Court has ruled they are admissible.
Mr. Sneddon: Before I do that, I want to ask you a question. We saw the box in the photograph that is -- well, let me just put the box on. Your Honor, could we have the port for the Elmo, if you --
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: And Your Honor, I guess I also need to tell the Court that at least one of these photographs has a cover which is maybe sexually explicit, in case there's any persons in the courtroom below the age of 18, I guess, or 21.
The Court: I think we've asked any 18-year-olds -- there were some students visiting. We've asked them not to come in during this period.
Mr. Sneddon: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Auchincloss: Could we have “Input 4”, Your Honor.
The Bailiff: Is the machine on. You need to push the button for the Elmo.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, if I stand on my head, I can see it, I guess.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Sergeant Robel, that's Photograph Exhibit 278, correct.
Steve Robel: Yes, it is.
Mr. Sneddon: Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, where was it when you first saw that box in Mr. Jackson's bedroom.
Steve Robel: The box itself was at the base of Mr. Jackson's bed on the floor.
Mr. Sneddon: And is that the condition of the box when you first saw it, or first looked into it.
Steve Robel: Yes. The top was closed, but I opened it up and that's what I saw, what's depicted up there.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, let me show you another photograph, which is People's 84. Was that magazine -- the one depicted in the front, was that the top magazine in the pile of magazines that you picked up.
Steve Robel: Can you rephrase that. I'm sorry.
Mr. Sneddon: Yeah. Was that one of the magazines you saw in the box.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Was that the first one you saw.
Steve Robel: No.
Mr. Sneddon: Was there another one on top of that one.
Steve Robel: Yeah, there were quite a few others on top.
Mr. Sneddon: So that was just down inside of it somewhere.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Do you remember how many of those -- how many of those magazines you actually took out of there.
Steve Robel: Before I got to that one, or just all together.
Mr. Sneddon: No, eventually.
Steve Robel: I would say approximately 15 to 20.
Mr. Sneddon: Now -- okay. If you can take that one down. And if we could put up 284. I guess I have to give them to you first, don't I. Put 283 up first. With regard to this particular item, 283, where was it located in the box; do you recall.
Steve Robel: I don't recall the exact location, but it was inside the cardboard box.
Mr. Sneddon: And let's put 284 up there. In regard to this book, The Chop Suey Club book, do you recognize that.
Steve Robel: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: And where was that when you first saw it.
Steve Robel: That was also inside the cardboard box.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. We can have the lights again, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, with regard to the items that you've talked about that you took out of that box, the books and the magazines, what did you do with them after you physically removed them from the box.
Steve Robel: What I did -- what I did was, I put them on top of the bed until I was finished going through the magazines that I thought were within the scope of the warrant, and then after I finished, I took the magazines and the books downstairs and gave them to Detective Padilla.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. And then Detective Padilla was responsible for packaging them up.
Steve Robel: That is correct. (Off-the-record discussion at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to hand you an exhibit marked as 279. Do you recognize that exhibit.
Steve Robel: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: And what is it.
Steve Robel: It's a layout of Mr. Jackson's upstairs bedroom.
Mr. Sneddon: Does that look -- does that look like the layout as you recall it when you were you were up there on November the 18th.
Steve Robel: Yes, it does.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I've indicated to Mr. Sanger that even though there are some measurements on that, that we're just using this simply to illustrate where the officer found the items for purposes of demonstrative evidence at this point in time only.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sneddon: And I would move that that be admitted into evidence at this point, Your Honor.
Mr. Sanger: I don't have any objection for that purpose. The numbers on it that we have just seen, the numbers would not be admitted for the truth of the matter without further foundation. But it can be put up.
Mr. Sneddon: I agree.
The Court: All right. It's admitted for that limited purpose. Do you need the screen, then.
Mr. Sneddon: Please, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: Sergeant Robel, you have the exhibit in front of you, and there is a copy of it exhibited to the jury on the Elmo, okay. Now, let's talk a little bit about the exhibit. It's 279, correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, you told us you recognize that. Would you use the laser, please, and show the ladies and gentlemen of the jury approximately where Mr. Jackson's bedroom would have been. I'm sorry, bed.
Steve Robel: It would have been right in this area here, up to there, over, right up into here.
Mr. Sneddon: So basically in the area where it has “MJ's Bedroom” written in letters on there.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, could you show the ladies and gentlemen of the jury where the box that you took the items that you've told us about, where that was located when you first saw it.
Steve Robel: It was right here at the base of the bed on the floor.
Mr. Sneddon: You're indicating -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
Steve Robel: Just kind of like where that half inch is.
Mr. Sneddon: Between the “4” and the “1”.
Steve Robel: Yeah, right in that area right there.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. Now, on your exhibit that's in front of you - okay --.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: -- could you please take the pen that we have, and can you please put a little -- just draw a box into the approximate location of where that item was found.
Steve Robel: Okay.
Mr. Sneddon: And there was a number assigned to the items that you took down to Deputy Padilla, correct.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: An item number. What item number was assigned to those particular things.
Steve Robel: I want to say 363.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Would you put a “363” on there. And then at the bottom of that exhibit, would you please sign your name. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: All right. Sergeant Robel, I think you can put that down right now if you want. And I think we can turn the lights back on, Your Honor. Let's leave it, rather than go back and forth. Let's see if we can finish it. I have a brown bag that I've shown counsel, Your Honor. We had it previously marked as 280 for identification.
Mr. Sanger: Could you say the number again. I apologize.
Mr. Sneddon: 280.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you.
Mr. Sneddon: Sergeant Robel, I'm going to ask you to look inside -- the bag is open. If you would just look inside the contents of 280, if you would, please. Do you recognize that item.
Steve Robel: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: And where and when -- let's take it one at a time. Where was that item the very first time you saw it.
Steve Robel: It was inside a nightstand upstairs in Mr. Jackson's bedroom.
Mr. Sneddon: And when you saw it, what did you do with it.
Steve Robel: I seized it.
Mr. Sneddon: And was that among one of the items you gave to Deputy Padilla.
Steve Robel: Yes, it was.
Mr. Sneddon: Does that bag that it was in, Exhibit 280, does that have a number on it.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: An item number.
Steve Robel: Yes, it does.
Mr. Sneddon: What is that.
Steve Robel: 362.
Mr. Sneddon: Now, could you please, using your laser, indicate to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury where Item 280 was found, or to be more correct, where Exhibit No. 280 was found.
Steve Robel: There was a night -- there was a nightstand right here, had a drawer in it, and I opened up the drawer and it was found inside the drawer inside the nightstand.
Mr. Sneddon: Would you please indicate on your exhibit and just put the item number there so we know which one that is. That's the approximate location of where it was when you first saw it.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. All right. I think I just have a couple more questions, and then we'll be done. (Off-the-record discussion held at counsel table.)
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, at this time I've shown counsel two clear plastic bags. The first one has been marked 281 for identification purposes. And the second one -- the first one, by the way, has ink at the top and the number “224”, so make sure we don't get confused. But the second one is marked as 282 for identification purposes, and it has a black pound figure with a “225” at the top. I'll show them to the witness. Sorry.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. With regard to 281, do you recognize that.
Steve Robel: Yes. Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. What is 281.
Steve Robel: It is Star Arvizo's fingerprints and palm prints.
Mr. Sneddon: And when and where was the first time you saw those prints.
Steve Robel: I took those prints on 5-5 of '04.
Mr. Sneddon: When you say you took those prints, would you describe for the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what you did.
Steve Robel: I met with Star, and I proceeded to go on ahead and fingerprint him with all ten fingers, and also his palm prints.
Mr. Sneddon: And were you -- were you the one that oversaw and directed him in obtaining those prints.
Steve Robel: Yes, I was.
Mr. Sneddon: All right. With regard to 282, do you recognize that item.
Steve Robel: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sneddon: And what is that.
Steve Robel: These are Gavin Arvizo's finger and palm prints.
Mr. Sneddon: And with regard to those particular prints, did you have a role in obtaining those.
Steve Robel: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sneddon: What role was that.
Steve Robel: I proceeded to do the same thing with Gavin Arvizo as I did with Star and rolled his fingerprints and his palm prints.
Mr. Sneddon: Was that done on a different occasion or on the same day.
Steve Robel: No, that was done on a separate occasion.
Mr. Sneddon: What was the date when you obtained Gavin's.
Steve Robel: That was on 9-14 of '04.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I request that both of those items be admitted into evidence.
The Court: They're admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: Madam Clerk, would you help me please. The chart, 279, is that in evidence. Or 280.
The Clerk: No.
Mr. Sneddon: I move that that be admitted as demonstrative evidence of the officer's testimony, Your Honor.
The Court: All right. It's admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: I believe all of them have been admitted at this point. Thank you. And I have no further questions.
Mr. Sanger: Well, wait a second. Except 280 was --
The Clerk: 280 wasn't received yet.
Mr. Sneddon: I thought --
Mr. Sanger: 280 is not the chart.
The Court: That's not the chart.
Mr. Sneddon: The chart was 279. And 280 is the note.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Okay. I move that that be admitted.
Mr. Sanger: No objection.
The Court: All right. 280 is admitted.
Mr. Sneddon: Apologize for that, for the confusion.
Message: CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SANGER:
Mr. Sanger: Well, let's start at the end and work backwards. How would that be. First of all, you roll the prints of Star and Gavin Arvizo, which is what you just told us, right.
Steve Robel: Yes, I did.
Mr. Sanger: And that's Exhibit 281, 282, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Are you a certified fingerprint examiner.
Steve Robel: No, I'm not.
Mr. Sanger: So you've learned to roll prints as a police officer, as a sheriff; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Let's talk about the -- this was not marked; is that right. Let's talk about what you found here, just moving backwards, going through these boxes. Your Honor, I'm going to put up on the screen, if I may, 278, which has been received, if that's acceptable.
The Court: All right.
Mr. Sanger: In fact, I'm going to take it off for one second. I'm sorry. Okay.
Mr. Sanger: All right. This was -- you basically were searching the residence, along with a lot of other officers, and we'll get to that in a bit, right. Is that correct.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you found this box.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: You personally found the box.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Do you know if anybody looked in the box before you got to it.
Steve Robel: I don't know that.
Mr. Sanger: All right. In other words, the way this looked is -- I guess we will go in general, here, to set the stage. The way this worked, I think you told us before, is you had that -- I think what you called a sweep or a protective sweep, or something, of the whole residence when you first arrived there; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And that was theoretically not a time to be looking in boxes and seizing evidence. It was a time to look in doors and see if people are in there, and sort of see what the interior looked like; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And then after you completed the sweep of the premises, then various officers were assigned various locations to go actually do searches; is that right.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And you said there was some people who are the seizers and some who were the scribes.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Sounds like it could be something from ancient Rome, I suppose. But the scribes were the officers who were just going to sit there and they were going to write out your sheriff's SH -- what is it. -- 541.
Steve Robel: 451.
Mr. Sanger: 451. Okay. Sorry. I got it backwards. Your 451 forms, those are the inventories where you say, “We give it a number, and this is what it is, and this is where it was located”; is that right.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then there were other officers who were looking around, and eventually some of those officers might actually see something and say, “I want to seize this”, and they'd actually pick it up, right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then they'd take it over to the scribe and say, “I seized this. This is where it came from”, and the scribe would write down on the -- on the 451 form that it was Sergeant Robel that seized it, right.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, in the course of this, however, there were officers who would be going through the same materials sometimes, going through opening boxes, and yet another officer might come along and be the one that might seize something from that box; is that true.
Steve Robel: Do you mean in addition to the actual search personnel that --
Mr. Sanger: No, no, the search personnel, the search personnel in the room, somebody might open a box and look through it, and another officer might come back and look at it a second time and say, “I want to seize something out of that box”; is that true.
Steve Robel: I don't know if that's true or not. That didn't happen in my situation, but --
Mr. Sanger: So -- well, you're telling us you're the first one to look in that box.
Steve Robel: The box was closed when I opened it up.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Well, that was going to be my next point. So the box was closed.
Steve Robel: It was closed.
Mr. Sanger: So the photograph is a photograph of the box. Exhibit 278 is a photograph of the box after you opened it up.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: Was it sealed or was it just folded in.
Steve Robel: It was folded like you would normally fold a cardboard box, kind of the flaps in between each other to keep it closed.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, as the investigator in this case, the lead investigator in this case, you are not aware of any witness who said that they specifically saw any one of these particular items, that being 283, 284 and 84; is that correct.
Steve Robel: At this present time, no.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So I just asked one of those bad questions. I said, “Is this correct”. Let me try not to do that. Based on your investigation, did anybody, any witness, specifically say that they saw any of these items, other than you as the searching officer.
Steve Robel: To the best of my knowledge, no.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you. Okay. Now, none of these items -- and by “items”, I'm referring 284, 283 and 84. None of these items are per se illegal to possess, are they. I'll just put them up quickly. They're not contraband.
Steve Robel: No, those are not illegal to possess, correct.
Mr. Sanger: So when they say “teenaged”, these are magazines that show models or people who are over -- who are 18 or over. However young they may look, that's -- they're 18 or over, as far as you can tell, correct.
Steve Robel: They're supposed to be, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And those are commercially available. You can go to a store and buy them, correct.
Steve Robel: As far as I know, yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, 283 -- I hate to just keep putting these up, but -- but 283 is a collector's item of some sort, is it not.
Steve Robel: I really don't know.
Mr. Sanger: Did you find some nudist magazines when you were looking around that were from the 1930s.
Steve Robel: Inside that box.
Mr. Sanger: Anywhere.
Steve Robel: I believe some other people, some other searchers found that.
Mr. Sanger: And you had no witness -- there was no witness that said they were shown that book or saw that book, as far as you know, right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now I'm going to put up 284. You seized that because it appeared to be a book that came within some concept of adult material; is that right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Do you know who Bruce Weber is.
Steve Robel: I do not.
Mr. Sanger: Now, when you were going through Mr. Jackson's home, did you see a number of items from notable people that were just lying around, or hanging on the wall, or sitting on a -- I'll give you some examples if you want. Did you see, for instance, a letter from Steven Spielberg that was just sitting on a table.
Steve Robel: I did not see that, no.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Did you see a letter from President Bush.
Steve Robel: I believe I saw that, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Did you see some correspondence from Ronald Reagan.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Did you see other correspondence from other notable celebrities and politicians and other people.
Steve Robel: I don't recall exactly who they were, but he had a lot of various things framed from those particular people, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And some things that weren't framed, right.
Steve Robel: The items that I found, that I saw.
Mr. Sanger: That you saw.
Steve Robel: They were framed.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Did you notice that -- first of all, how many books do you think there were in Mr. Jackson's residence, taking the -- taking the places that you searched on the ranch. I'm not talking about, obviously, anyplace you didn't search, storage places or elsewhere, but on the ranch.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. Go ahead.
Mr. Sanger: Let me withdraw it.
Mr. Sneddon: It's unintelligible, that's what I'm saying.
Mr. Sanger: All right. I'll withdraw it.
Mr. Sanger: Taking into account the areas that you went through -- let's back up. What areas did you go through.
Steve Robel: That I particularly searched.
Mr. Sanger: No, that you went through. You walked through all the areas that were eventually going to be searched; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And so you went through the main house.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Went through Mr. Jackson's office.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: You went upstairs from his office into the video library.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And some other little rooms associated with that, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: You went into the arcade building, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Any other locations that you went through.
Steve Robel: The security.
Mr. Sanger: The security office at the end of the office -- or the building that had Mr. Jackson's office in it, correct.
Steve Robel: The one clear at the end, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So, as you went through these various locations, there were over 10,000 books, were there not.
Steve Robel: That's going to be kind of difficult for me to say over 10,000. I would say that there were definitely several hundred, but 10,000, I really couldn't say that for sure. There were quite a few, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. You remember the library.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And the library had, for the most part, leather-bound books and sets and that sort of thing, correct.
Steve Robel: Yes, it did.
Mr. Sanger: There were hundreds of books just in that library, were there not.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then the hallway leading to Mr. Jackson's quarters, where he had the first floor and the bedroom upstairs, that hallway had books, bookcases lining one side of the hallway, correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And there were hundreds of books there, were there not.
Steve Robel: There were quite a few, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then when you went into Mr. Jackson's private quarters and you went down the steps into that -- the big living room area, whatever it is, with the big screen T.V., there were quite a number of books stacked up on the floor there, were there not.
Steve Robel: There were.
Mr. Sanger: And then there was -- there was another bookcase full of books; is that correct.
Steve Robel: I believe that, yes, you're right.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And then there were books lying around stacked up in various places, in the bathroom and his -- his bedroom upstairs, quite a number of books stacked up.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then upstairs in the house, in between the craft room and Prince Michael's bedroom, Mr. Jackson's son's bedroom, there's a little cove with children's books; is that right.
Steve Robel: There were books there, yes. I'm not sure if they were children's books, but you're correct.
Mr. Sanger: Quite a number of books there.
Steve Robel: Right.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And then in Mr. Jackson's office, there were books stacked up, for the most part, in various parts of his office; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Yeah. Mainly around his desk area, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And there was actually a separate room as you would go into the office, into the front office. You turn left, there's a little hallway, left again, there was a little room that had shelves with hundreds of books; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Is that where the bathroom is. Is that what you're referring to.
Mr. Sanger: Just before the bathroom, yes. Talking about his office.
Steve Robel: Right.
Mr. Sanger: Turn left, a closet, a big closet area with shelves in it with hundreds of books.
Steve Robel: Correct. Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And then in the arcade, there was a -- a room with a low door on the second floor, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And in there, there were thousands of books in bookshelves like a bookstore, right.
Steve Robel: Yeah. It looked like a library, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And there were boxes of books still in boxes, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, you saw all of this on November the 18th, 2003, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: So you don't know what exactly was there in February or March; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That's a true statement.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, having talked about all those books, among the books as you went through, did you notice from time to time there might be more than one copy of the same book.
Steve Robel: Me, no, did not notice that.
Mr. Sanger: Did you notice that it appeared that a publisher or an author had sent books to Mr. Jackson.
Steve Robel: I am unaware of that.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, this particular book, Mr. Weber, who's up there, Bruce Weber, The Chop Suey Club, were you aware that Mr. Weber sent this to Mr. Jackson unsolicited.
Steve Robel: No, I'm not.
Mr. Sanger: Were you aware that Mr. Weber was a photographer who had photographed The Jackson 5.
Steve Robel: No.
Mr. Sanger: Photographed other people, Nelson Mandela and a lot of other people.
Steve Robel: No.
Mr. Sanger: Inside that very book, there's an actual photograph of Elizabeth Taylor; is that correct.
Steve Robel: It's been a while since I've looked at that book, so I couldn't say for sure.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And if I didn't specifically ask you on that, this, there was no witness that said they were shown this book or saw this book, is that correct, other than you and the officer that booked it into evidence.
Steve Robel: To the best of my knowledge, yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So you -- let me have just one second. You originally got involved in this case by virtue of an assignment by Lieutenant Klapakis; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Actually, it came higher up than the lieutenant, but he was involved in it, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Did it come directly from Mr. Sneddon.
Steve Robel: No. He wasn't involved in that.
Mr. Sanger: You're aware Mr. Sneddon had talked directly with Lieutenant Klapakis about being assigned to this case; is that correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I object. That misstates the evidence.
Mr. Sanger: Well, let me withdraw it.
The Court: I'll sustain the objection.
Mr. Sanger: Somebody -- you're saying you were assigned -- anyway, whoever assigned you, somebody assigned you; Lieutenant Klapakis or somebody higher up.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Right.
Steve Robel: Right.
Mr. Sanger: And what day were you first assigned to the case.
Steve Robel: To the best of my knowledge, I think it was right around June, between June 15th and June 20th, I'm not exact on the date, 2003.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So at the time you were assigned on June 20th, Detective Zelis had already been assigned to this case; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That's what I was told, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And so Detective Zelis was already starting to work on the case.
Steve Robel: To the best of my knowledge, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then you came in and basically took over the lead investigator responsibilities; is that right.
Steve Robel: I was initially told that I was coming on to supervise it and to actually conduct the interviews and be a part of that process, yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to give you a timeline. And I'm going to show counsel. Who's doing this. Oh, Tom. I'm sorry. With the Court's permission, I'd like to have this piece of paper -- it has a timeline on it. No content. I'd like to ask that this be marked for identification next in order. And I'd like to approach the witness, if I may.
The Court: All right. What number is that.
The Clerk: That's 5035.
The Court: 5035.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Sergeant, let me go back so they can hear me. I've given you 5035 for identification, which is a timeline. And if the Court would permit, what I propose to do is just put a blank timeline, same thing, up there --
The Court: You may.
Mr. Sanger: -- on the screen. So I think we need Input....
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, before you start writing on that, which is what I'm going to ask you to do -- close enough -- I've given you the same document that's on the screen; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And what I'm going to ask you to do is write on yours, and if you still have that pointer up there, I'll ask you at future moments here to refer to the one on the screen so we can see what we're doing. But first of all, why don't you write your name up there where it says “Witness”, so we can remember who did this. All right. And what I'd like you to do is -- you understand the timeline. It should be pretty --
Steve Robel: Yes, it's 2003 and 2004.
Mr. Sanger: Starting with January, February, March, April, May.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: So, just as a point of reference, you understood, from your investigation, the general time frame in which the allegations were made. In other words, the allegations were made about a general time frame; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Somewhere between February 7th to March the 13th; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So could you just make a bracket or a mark on your copy there for that time period that pertains to the allegations that were made against Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to interpose an objection that it's vague because there are several counts in this case involving several different allegations, and the time frames are different.
Mr. Sanger: We have -- Your Honor, if I may --
Mr. Sneddon: Well, I object to the question, the form of the question.
Mr. Sanger: I've asked for the general time period, and I will break it down later.
The Court: You're not asking him to make a mark now before you get to a specific charge.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, he did.
The Court: Well, I wasn't sure if he was making a general instruction or a specific question.
Mr. Sanger: Yeah, I was asking him to put a bracket so that we have a frame of reference on this exhibit as to the general time frame. We will obviously go back --
The Court: I'll ask you to do it one at a time so that he knows exactly what you're asking him to put on the diagram.
Mr. Sanger: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: Well, let's do it -- because we are going to go through this in more detail, but I want to get the big picture. There was a time that you were told, and you found from your investigation, that the Arvizo children and Janet Arvizo and Mr. Jackson and others returned to the Neverland Valley Ranch after being in Florida; is that right.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And what was that date.
Steve Robel: I believe it was right around the 6th of February.
Mr. Sanger: 7th perhaps.
Steve Robel: 7th. Somewhere right in there.
Mr. Sanger: So why don't you just mark that roughly. Put a little line, and you can put --
Steve Robel: Do you want me to put “March 7th” there.
Mr. Sanger: Sure. Put a little line and you can write up above what it is.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I think --
Mr. Sanger: “Arrived”.
Mr. Sneddon: I think he misspoke.
Mr. Sanger: Who misspoke.
Mr. Sneddon: I think he said March.
Steve Robel: No, that's right. I did.
Mr. Sanger: I'm sorry, I meant to say February.
Steve Robel: It's February 7th.
Mr. Sanger: Did we both say March.
Steve Robel: I think I did.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Let's get it right. It's February 7th.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And then there was a time that you came to understand the Arvizos claimed that they left Neverland Valley Ranch for the last time.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Do you know what date that was.
Steve Robel: That I believe was March 12th.
Mr. Sanger: March 12th.
Steve Robel: Okay. And could you mark March 12th.
Mr. Sanger: And then why don't you just -- I'm sure everybody's on board, but just so -- in case, from the angle, it's hard, just point roughly where you are on this timeline. February 7th through 22.
Steve Robel: Yeah, February 7th. And then over here would be March the 12th.
Mr. Sanger: All right. There you go. I'm going to -- I will come back to a more detailed timeline with a different chart that has February and March called out later, but that gives you the parameters. When do you understand Mr. Feldman and Mr. Katz made contact with the Santa Barbara District Attorney in this case.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. That assumes facts not in evidence. Plus, it's compound because it has two names in it.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Let's put it this way: It's your understanding that Mr. Feldman called Mr. Sneddon; is that correct.
Steve Robel: I believe so, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Do you know when that occurred, based on your investigation.
Steve Robel: I want to say it was possibly sometime in June.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Do you have a report to refresh your recollection that would help you with that. I don't know if you have the Bates stamps up there or not. Yes, page 25, if you do.
Steve Robel: No, I don't have that.
Mr. Sanger: Page two of Detective Zelis's report.
Steve Robel: That's the one I -- yes, it was June 13th, 2003.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So, can you indicate on your chart -- why don't you just point, so we do it consistently, where that would be, roughly.
Steve Robel: Right there.
Mr. Sanger: June 13. In between June and July, okay. So why don't you indicate that on your report -- I mean, on your exhibit. And your understanding was that that same day, June 13th, Detective Zelis actually called Dr. Katz and interviewed Dr. Katz; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So maybe you can make a note on that, “Dr. Katz interviewed”. You can abbreviate so it all fits. Okay. Now, you were involved in all of the interviews that were tape-recorded of the Arvizo family prior to the grand jury testimony; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: What was the first date that you conducted an interview with the Arvizo family. Let's take the children for right now.
Steve Robel: That would have been July 7th.
Mr. Sanger: July 7th, 2003. And so three or four weeks after the Katz interview; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Why don't you put that on your chart there. And what was the next time -- I'll let you finish that, I'm sorry.
Steve Robel: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: What was the next time that you interviewed the Arvizo children.
Steve Robel: That would have been August 13th --
Mr. Sanger: All right.
Steve Robel: -- 2003.
Mr. Sanger: Put that interview up there. Okay.
Steve Robel: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, you were aware that Mr. Sneddon had a meeting with the -- with Mrs. Arvizo at some point; is that correct.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object to that question. It's vague as to what point in time, I believe, when he's dealing with dates in here. It's vague.
Mr. Sanger: I'll tell you what.
The Court: He asked him “at some point”.
Mr. Sanger: Yes, then I'll ask him when, if he knows.
Mr. Sanger: Did Mr. Sneddon have a meeting, a meeting alone with Mrs. Arvizo, sometime before the search warrant.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Do you know what the date of that was.
Steve Robel: I do not.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Sometime in early November.
Steve Robel: It could have been. It was before the search warrant service. I do know that.
Mr. Sanger: All right. We'll skip that. We'll come back to that later. The next significant event I want you to focus on is the actual execution of the search warrant, which was November the 18th, 2003; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And can you list that -- why don't you point at the map there, just in case, just to show where we are on our trip down the road here. So now we're on November the 18th, halfway in between November-December. Okay. Why don't you make a notation there. That's the search warrant.
Steve Robel: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: The next documented interview with the Arvizo children was when.
Steve Robel: Do you mean beyond the August 13th.
Mr. Sanger: Yes. You put August 13th up there.
Steve Robel: Yeah, I already have August 13th.
Mr. Sanger: So what's the next one. Was it November the 25th.
Steve Robel: I don't recall another -- are we talking about a -- an interview with them.
Mr. Sanger: Yes.
Steve Robel: Oh. No, I -- I do have it here. That's for the bucchal swabs. I have that. That was November 25th.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. November 25th.
Steve Robel: Of 2003.
Mr. Sanger: And that was actually tape-recorded, is that correct, an interview.
Steve Robel: I believe it was, yes.
Mr. Sanger: So can you put “November 25th, 2003”. All right.
Steve Robel: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: And then when was the next documented interview with the Arvizo children.
Steve Robel: That I don't believe I conducted. There was various things that we would contact them in regards to, but as far as an interview, no. I can't -- I can't recall.
Mr. Sanger: Was there a tape-recorded interview on January the 19th, 2004.
Steve Robel: I don't recall. I don't have that report. Who's the author of that. Me. Or --
Mr. Sanger: Well, I have the transcript here, and I'll have to find the report. But while I'm doing that, or before I do that, let me see if I can refresh your recollection a little bit. Do you recall a meeting with the Arvizo children during which, or preceding which, they were played the rebuttal video.
Steve Robel: I do remember that.
Mr. Sanger: And after the rebuttal video was played for them, then you interviewed the various children one by one; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Yeah, but I was not involved in the interview process of that. I was there, in and out. That would be Detective Zelis that was the author of that report. And he participated with the attorneys.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And when you say “the attorneys”, who was there.
Steve Robel: I believe it was Mr. Zonen and Mr. Sneddon.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Mr. Zonen and Mr. Sneddon actually engaged in asking questions and making remarks during those interviews, correct.
Steve Robel: I do recall, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. All right. So, could you --
Steve Robel: Mr. Sanger.
Mr. Sanger: Yes.
Steve Robel: No, it was -- I stand corrected on that. It was Mr. Zonen that was in there conducting that. Mr. Sneddon was with me outside the room. I mean, we watched the videos together, but then when it came to questioning the kids, we both stepped out, and it was Mr. Zonen and Detective Zelis that handled that.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Let me see if I can refresh your recollection in that regard. May I approach.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: I'm showing you a transcript. And you're welcome to look at the whole thing. The introduction and subsequent pages where there's some references, does that refresh your recollection that --
Steve Robel: Yes, it does.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Was Mr. Sneddon there and did he actually participate in part of the interview.
Steve Robel: Yes, he did.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Okay. So having said that, can you put on your chart -- let me take the book back. Thank you. Put on your chart a reference for this interview, which is January 19, 2004, or series of interviews.
Steve Robel: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And then I'll ask you to do one other thing. You remember the grand jury proceedings in this case; is that correct.
Steve Robel: I do.
Mr. Sanger: Do you recall the approximate time of the grand jury proceedings.
Steve Robel: March and April, I think, 2004.
Mr. Sanger: End of March, beginning of April.
Steve Robel: Yeah, that sounds about right.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Could you simply make a notation on your chart indicating “grand jury” and just that general time period there.
Steve Robel: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: Having done all of that, does that fairly and accurately represent the testimony that you've given so far about these dates.
Steve Robel: Yes, it does.
Mr. Sanger: Your Honor, I'd move the admission and ask for permission to publish the exhibit.
The Court: It's admitted. You may publish.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you. May I approach and retrieve it.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sneddon: Mr. Sanger. Thank you.
Mr. Sanger: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Can we go through, just really quickly with the pointer there, so you can tell us what you wrote.
Steve Robel: Okay. On February the 7th, that's when the family returned back from Miami. March the 12th, that's when the Arvizos left the ranch for good. On June 13th, 2003, we received a call from Attorney Feldman. And then on June 13th, Dr. Katz was interviewed. And July 7th was the first interview with the Arvizo children. August 13th was a follow-up interview with the kids. November 25th is when I met with Star and Gavin for the bucchal swabs. And November 18th is when we served the search warrant at Neverland. January 19th, 2004, that's when the family was interviewed regarding the rebuttal tape. And then end of March through April of 2004, the grand jury.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Thank you. Now, this means that you interviewed -- let me withdraw that. Were there other times that the children were talked to by law enforcement officers during the period depicted on Exhibit 5035 that were not reduced to reports and were not tape-recorded.
Steve Robel: There were various times that I would contact them to see how they were doing and things to that effect. But as far as interviews, no.
Mr. Sanger: And based on your training and experience, you would want to record the important and relevant materials, either by way of a written report, or a written report with an actual tape-recording.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So, before the search on November 18th -- I wonder if I could borrow -- it really belongs to the prosecution, so I should ask the prosecution if I can borrow their pointer. If I may address directly, Your Honor.
Mr. Sneddon: I don't have it.
Mr. Sanger: It's up there.
Mr. Sneddon: Oh, of course. (Laughter.)
Mr. Sneddon: You're a taxpayer. It belongs to the county.
Mr. Sanger: There you go.
Mr. Sneddon: I think you pay your taxes.
Mr. Sanger: Now I have to figure out how to use it. Ahh, that's how you use it. Thank you.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, if we look at -- we have July the 7th is the first set of interviews, right, that are on tape.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then August 13th, right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Up to that point, you have not really gathered much in the way of physical evidence in this case; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: November 18th, you told us that you had conducted a search at Neverland Ranch, right.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And that's where you had quite a number of officers and you were there all day, correct.
Steve Robel: Right.
Mr. Sanger: And you've told us some of the things that your department retrieved as a result of this search, correct.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: There was certainly quite a number of other items that were retrieved, were seized, as a result of that search; is that right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: In addition to that, two other locations were searched on that same day, on November the 18th, correct.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: One of the locations was Hamid Moslehi's house; is that right.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And the other location was the office of Brad Miller.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, with regard to all of these searches, you were responsible for the briefing of the officers before they went out to do the searches; is that right.
Steve Robel: I was one of the personnel that was involved in that, yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And, of course, as the lead investigator, you knew that all this was going on, right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And after the searches were completed, you were eventually briefed on what was retrieved from the various searches; is that right.
The Court: Can we turn on the light again or -- are you through with that.
Mr. Sanger: We could for a couple minutes. In fact, what I'll try to do is see if I can avoid coming back to it before the next break.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So just give us an idea of how much, quantity-wise, was seized from the Neverland Ranch search.
Steve Robel: Are you taking about the various items, Mr. Sanger. I mean, quantity --
Mr. Sanger: There were --
Steve Robel: There was -- there was a lot. I mean, there was hundreds, yes, of items that we took.
Mr. Sanger: And of the hundreds of items that you took, you were not able to evaluate all of them in the field; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Evaluate them to -- their description. Or just to see what -- if they fall within, what, the search warrant.
Mr. Sanger: No. We're not talking about that.
Steve Robel: Okay. I just -- I didn't understand.
Mr. Sanger: You seized things. That's a legal issue. That's fine. We're here -- I'm not worried about that. Let's put it this way: When you seize certain items at any search, quite often you have to go back to the office, you have to look at them, evaluate them, try to figure out how they fit into the puzzle. Sometimes, if it's a tape, you got to watch it. If it's a computer, you have to download it and look at it, right.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So the fact that you searched things on November 18th doesn't mean that you necessarily are going to know the contents and significance of everything that you seized as of the end of the day; is that right.
Steve Robel: That's a true statement, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And with regard to Mr. Moslehi, he was -- his residence was in the Los Angeles area; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Yeah, San Fernando Valley, I believe.
Mr. Sanger: And the material had been taken from there and brought up to Santa Barbara; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then people had to look through it and try to figure out what it was, what it meant.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And among other things, there were a number of tapes, either videotapes or CDs or some medium, but there was a number of recorded items that were taken from Mr. Moslehi's house; is that right.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you understood that he was a professional videographer; is that right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And so consequently, he had a lot of videos, I suppose, right.
Steve Robel: Right.
Mr. Sanger: And then Mr. Miller, Brad Miller, was a licensed private investigator; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: Or I should say “is”, I suppose. But at the time he was as well, right.
Steve Robel: Right.
Mr. Sanger: And in the -- as the lead investigator, you're aware that what was seized from his office included some video and audio tapes; is that right.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So it took some time for the investigators in the case -- well, let me back up just a little bit and withdraw that. When you do a search like this, you bring a lot of people in to assist who are not going to be permanently on the team investigating the case; is that right.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: So you may detail people from another division or another unit whose duties have nothing to do with this case or even a case like this; is that right.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And once they do their job, once they've completed the detail, they have finished doing the search, they bring the stuff back and book it into your sheriff's evidence locker, they go on and do something else, right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And they may not be involved in the case again unless they're called in to testify as to what they did, right.
Steve Robel: Right.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So you have the scribes and the seizers, and they bring the evidence back, and then it may be that somebody totally different is going to be assigned to actually evaluate it and understand it and figure out how it fits into the case, right.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So I was going to try to get to the break without asking the lights go off one more time, but let's do it, if we can, please. Thank you, Your Honor. So, up to this point, November 18th, you were not aware, as of that point, that there had been a tape-recording by Bradley Miller of this family; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Only -- yeah, you are correct.
Mr. Sanger: And as of November 18th, you were not aware that there had actually been a film made of this family, which later became known as “the rebuttal film”; is that correct.
Steve Robel: I believe that -- and I'm not -- because I haven't reviewed that statement, but I believe that Mrs. Arvizo was explaining to us in her interview that that had taken place.
Mr. Sanger: Well, we weren't talking about Mrs. Arvizo, because she hasn't testified yet.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object to that. He's asking what the officer was aware of. This isn't a segregation.
Mr. Sanger: No, this --
Mr. Sneddon: I apologize. I object. Assumes facts not in evidence, And it's argumentative.
Mr. Sanger: I apologize, because I said something, but I will withdraw the question. How's that.
The Court: I'm looking for a break, but -- rephrase your question.
Mr. Sanger: Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Sanger: That's true, I am asking for your awareness, but I was trying to avoid -- I don't want to get into hearsay that's not admissible because we haven't had the people testify yet, okay. So it's your belief that Janet Arvizo said something about doing a film.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: Before November 18th.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. None of the children mentioned doing the film before November 18th, though, correct.
Steve Robel: To the best of my knowledge, that is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And after the search, the searches on November 18th, you eventually -- well, you got November 18th and November 25th all in kind of the same place. But after the searches on November 18th, you became aware that there were actual copies of videos; is that correct.
Steve Robel: There were videos that we had seized. Is that what you're --
Mr. Sanger: Yes. But as of the 25th, you hadn't actually watched the -- what turned out to be called “the rebuttal video”; is that correct.
Steve Robel: I -- I can't say for sure if I did or not, Mr. Sanger, because like I said, I had other guys assigned going through that, because I was doing other things at that point. But I was pulled in to watch different things at various times, but I can't say for sure when I actually saw the rebuttal film.
Mr. Sanger: All right. But the first time you ever saw the rebuttal film was sometime after November 18th; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That would be a correct statement, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then January the 19th, 2004, was the date that you assembled the Arvizo children to watch the video; is that right.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And they all watched it together, correct.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And then you conducted additional interviews of each of the children; is that right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
The Court: All right. We'll take our break.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you.
Recess Message: Recess taken.
The Court: All right. You may proceed.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Sanger: All right. We've established this timeline now -- is that on. Yes. We've established the timeline, and let's just start with Davellin. The first time that Davellin said anything to you about the rebuttal video was in the January 19th, 2004, interview, correct.
Steve Robel: I believe that's correct, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Now, when you had these interviews, this was a pretty big event in the investigation, was it not, the interviews of January 19th.
Steve Robel: A big event in what respect.
Mr. Sanger: Big event in the respect that you -- you, meaning you and Mr. Sneddon and Mr. Zonen and perhaps other law enforcement officers, had seen the rebuttal video, and you were calling the family in to ask them how they could do that video.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I object. Assumes facts not in evidence.
Mr. Sanger: Well, it was compound probably. Let me break it down.
Mr. Sanger: You had seen the video by January 19th, correct.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And to your knowledge, had Mr. Sneddon seen the video by January 19th.
Steve Robel: I don't recall that.
Mr. Sanger: Before he commenced or before you all commenced the interviews with the kids on January 19th, Mr. Sneddon saw the video, correct.
Steve Robel: I can't answer that. I'm not sure of that. I know that I -- a portion of that video I did see, because one of my investigators showed it to me on the computer.
Mr. Sanger: All right.
Steve Robel: I can't answer for Mr. Sneddon. I believe that was the first time I saw it. I'm not positive, though.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. My question may not have been clear. What I was talking about is, at the very least, he showed the video before you started doing the interview with the kids, correct.
Steve Robel: Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And when you showed the video to the kids, Mr. Sneddon watched it, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Mr. Zonen watched it, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: You watched it.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And were there any other people there. Was Detective Zelis there.
Steve Robel: Detective Zelis.
Mr. Sanger: He watched it.
Steve Robel: That's correct. And I think Lieutenant Klapakis watched it.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, the reason for the meeting, as it were, was to ask this family how they could do a rebuttal video like that if they maintained these allegations; is that correct.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object to that question as argumentative. It's just -- that's like testifying.
The Court: Overruled.
Mr. Sanger: Do you have the question in mind.
Steve Robel: Why don't you repeat your question.
The Court: I'll have the court reporter do it.
The Court Reporter: All right. Now, the reason for the meeting, as it were, was to ask this family how they could do a rebuttal video like that if they maintained these allegations; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That is incorrect. It was to clarify regarding my previous interview with them, to clarify issues that they were saying on the tape.
Mr. Sanger: All right. As of the previous interviews, none of the Arvizo children had been asked about the rebuttal video, correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And none of them had been asked about the Miller interview; is that correct.
Steve Robel: I believe that's correct.
Mr. Sanger: In fact, due to whatever factors, you were not able to actually listen to the Miller video until sometime in February, I believe, of 2004; is that correct.
Mr. Sneddon: I think counsel misspoke about a video.
Mr. Sanger: What did I say. I said “listen to a video”. I meant “listen to an audiotape”, you're correct. May I rephrase.
The Court: Rephrase, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Towards the end of the day. I didn't have pizza, but I'm -- maybe because I didn't, I'm fading here. Okay. Let's try that again.
Mr. Sanger: The Miller tape, which now we've found is an audiotape; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And that audiotape apparently was made about March the 16th, I believe, is that correct, of 2003.
Steve Robel: That sounds about right.
Mr. Sanger: So that tape was not found at all by law enforcement before November 18, correct.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And in other words, when I say “found”, nobody gave you a copy. You didn't have a copy of it, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And nobody told you about it before November 18th, did they.
Steve Robel: Yeah. Meaning nobody told me about the interview or about the tape.
Mr. Sanger: That there was a tape-recorded interview with Brad Miller.
Steve Robel: I cannot say for sure because I haven't gone over my report, my interview with Mrs. Arvizo. But I believe she mentioned something in her interview regarding that.
Mr. Sanger: Your belief right now as you're sitting there --
Steve Robel: I believe so. I'm not positive, but I believe it was mentioned during that interview.
Mr. Sanger: We'll come back to that. As far as the kids are concerned, the kids never mentioned anything about being tape-recorded.
Steve Robel: I don't believe they did.
Mr. Sanger: And they were never asked anything about being tape-recorded, were they.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: Does that help refresh your recollection that you didn't know about it.
Steve Robel: Right. We didn't know, right.
Mr. Sanger: Now, that tape, that audiotape of Brad Miller doing the interview with the Arvizo family, was seized on November 18th from Brad Miller's office, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Due to reasons beyond your control, you were not able to actually listen to that tape until sometime in February of 2004; is that correct.
Steve Robel: I'm not sure of the date, but it was right around that -- it was 2004, somewhere in there.
Mr. Sanger: And it was after the January 19th interview.
Steve Robel: I believe it was.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So when you interviewed Davellin on January 19th, 2004, you asked her why she said “father”, and why they were talking about “father” and “father figure” and all that; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Okay. You're getting into the interview portion of it, and I -- to the best of my recollection, I don't recall me being the one that interviewed her regarding that video. That would have been Detective Zelis.
Mr. Sanger: You were in and out of the room.
Steve Robel: Yes, I was.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. When you were in the room, you don't recall ever talking about Dieter telling her she had to say that sort of thing.
Steve Robel: Like I said, I'd have to go on ahead and -- if you have the transcripts to that, to let me recall my memory, that would be great.
Mr. Sanger: I do have the transcripts.
Steve Robel: I cannot remember what portions that I was in, and a majority of those I was not in.
Mr. Sanger: May I approach, Your Honor.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: The transcript of that particular interview is a few pages. I've given you the whole notebook.
Steve Robel: This has the D.A. and then it has her. It doesn't have us.
Mr. Sanger: If you -- I'm sorry. What I did - I was going to explain - I gave it to you open to the page that I had it open to.
Steve Robel: Right.
Mr. Sanger: If you go back, you'll see where it starts there. And you're welcome to look at the whole thing. Either you were there or you weren't. If you weren't there, that's okay. You can just tell me, and we'll --
Steve Robel: I don't recall being in -- sitting in on this particular interview, is what I'm saying. And even with the boys and so forth, because I was out doing other things. I watched the video that day. I did watch that.
Mr. Sanger: I'll come get it in a second. You've reviewed the transcript that I've showed you, of Davellin's interview of January the 19th, 2004, and it doesn't refresh your recollection as to anything that might have been said in your presence.
Steve Robel: It doesn't.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. All right. May I approach.
The Court: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Thank you.
Mr. Sanger: As the lead investigator in this case, did you become aware after the January 19th interviews that essentially the three children had an explanation for how they could give that interview that was shown on the rebuttal and still maintain their allegations.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And, in essence, they were claiming that Dieter told them to say much of what was said on that tape.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Well, while we're on Davellin -- and then we'll go back to the others and see how far we get with them. And, Your Honor, if you wanted to hit the lights --
The Court: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: -- that would be fine.
Mr. Sanger: With regard to Davellin, you first interviewed her on July 7th, '03. We talked about that, right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And that was the interview where she gave you a tremendous amount of detail about what happened to her brothers, allegedly, right.
Steve Robel: “Detail” meaning -- regarding what.
Mr. Sanger: Well, we could go through it.
Steve Robel: I have transcripts of her interview up here.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Davellin told you some things that she claimed to have observed herself, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And none of those things involved allegations of child molest; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Right.
Mr. Sanger: That she observed herself.
Steve Robel: I believe you're correct, yes.
Mr. Sanger: However, she gave you details as to what allegedly happened to Gavin and allegedly what Star claimed to have seen; is that right.
Steve Robel: I recall her giving me details regarding drinking alcohol, things to that effect, but not regarding the actual act of molestation, no.
Mr. Sanger: She told you -- well, let's do it this way. Your Honor, the bailiff indicated I was supposed to alert if we were going to get into sexually explicit --
The Court: No, just the photographs.
Mr. Sanger: Just photographs, okay.
Mr. Sanger: She told you -- and I'm talking about July 7th, 2003. She told you that --
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor -- Go ahead. I'm sorry.
Mr. Sanger: Let me start again.
Mr. Sanger: I'm talking about the July 7th, 2003, interview. She told you that Gavin and Star told her that Michael Jackson talked to them about masturbation. Is that correct.
Steve Robel: Okay, that does -- yes.
Mr. Sanger: And she told you that the conversation involved the question of whether or not white stuff came out; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: She told you that Gavin and Star talked about other particular claims like the mannequin incident, right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And there are a number of others; is that right. A number of other details.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. And she told you that the way she learned those details is that Gavin would tell her and Star would stand there and listen and agree with what Gavin was saying.
Steve Robel: I don't recall that.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. I'll come back to that in one second. She also told you that her mother had told her certain things about this; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Just -- I don't know what certain things you're talking about, Mr. Sanger.
Mr. Sanger: Well, for instance, that the mother had told her the story about the urine bottle --
Steve Robel: Okay. Yes.
Mr. Sanger: -- is that right. Now, on the other one there, I'm going to refer you to page 24.
Steve Robel: Okay. I'm there.
Mr. Sanger: Would it refresh your recollection as to what you were told at that time.
Steve Robel: Do you mean the whole page, is what you're asking, or --
Mr. Sanger: I'm sorry. If you start at about line 13, or line 11.
Steve Robel: Yes, it does.
Mr. Sanger: And, in fact, Davellin told you that Gavin and Star told her the stories, correct.
Steve Robel: Yes. That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And that she said, “Yeah, it's like one tells me and the other one agrees to it”. Is that a quote as to what she said to you at that time.
Steve Robel: I -- it's in the transcripts. I don't recall her saying that, but it's there, so it must be correct.
Mr. Sanger: Well, I don't want you to agree with something reluctantly.
Steve Robel: I mean, I don't recall her saying that.
Mr. Sanger: Would it help you to listen to the tape to refresh your recollection.
Steve Robel: That probably would.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Would you be able to do that at the break this evening and come back tomorrow. I don't want to do it here in court, if we can avoid it.
Steve Robel: Sure.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. You have a copy of the tape you can listen to.
Steve Robel: I think I can get a copy of that, sure.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Do you recall her saying -- let me withdraw that. Do you recall Detective Zelis asking her, “So they” -- “So are they together” -- I'm sorry. Let me try it again. “So are they together when they tell you this”. And Davellin saying, “Yeah, most of the time”. Detective Zelis: “Most of the time. Okay”. Do you recall that, or do you need to listen to the tape to refresh --
Steve Robel: Well, the interview was quite a while ago, so, I mean, I need to listen to that as well.
Mr. Sanger: This was a transcript that was actually prepared by a certified court reporter --
Steve Robel: Uh-huh.
Mr. Sanger: -- is that correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And it was prepared at the request of the sheriff's department, or the D.A.; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So you don't have any reason to believe that the transcript is inaccurate. You just want to be careful and --
Steve Robel: Correct. That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, do you recall Davellin telling you on -- during this interview of July the 7th, that Gavin was a loving little boy, and that he started acting out after these events.
Steve Robel: Yes, I do.
Mr. Sanger: Do you recall the next interview on August 13, 2003, where she said Gavin was becoming violent and argumentative as a result of these events.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, there was an interview -- let me just be sure I've got the right one here. Excuse me. Did you interview Davellin on November the 25th.
Steve Robel: No. I believe, to the best of my recollection, it was only the boys.
Mr. Sanger: Only the boys. Okay. At some point, did Davellin tell you in one of the interviews that she was always by herself at the ranch and she was not allowed to be with her mom.
Steve Robel: I'd have to review that.
Mr. Sanger: All right. I'll ask you if you could do that. And I'll find you the page number for that --
Steve Robel: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: -- before we leave today. All right. Let's take a look at -- at Gavin Arvizo's. Now, Gavin Arvizo, on August 13, 2003 -- let me withdraw that, before we get to this. This pertains to the story or the claims about masturbation. You were sitting here when Gavin Arvizo testified on the stand during this trial, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And he said that Michael Jackson told him, “If men don't masturbate, they get to a level where they can -- might rape a girl”. Do you remember that.
Steve Robel: I do.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. That was the first time you ever heard Gavin Arvizo attribute that statement to Michael Jackson, was it not, sir.
Steve Robel: I believe so.
Mr. Sanger: And, in fact, Gavin Arvizo told you on August 13, 2003, that it was his grandmother who told him, “If men don't do it, men might get to a point where they might go ahead and rape a woman”. Is that correct. Page 28, if you want to take a look at it.
Steve Robel: I'd like to do that.
Mr. Sanger: August 13th.
Steve Robel: Is that 28 you said.
Mr. Sanger: Yes. 28, line 4, starts, “My grandma explained it to me”.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: And you remember him saying that because, in fact, you testified before the grand jury on April 14th that -- of 2004, that Gavin, in fact, told you that his grandmother said that; is that correct, sir.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And, in fact, in the August 13, 2003, interview, Gavin said, “My grandma explained it to me. She told me that -- that you're -- the only reason -- because like if -- if men don't do it, men might get to a point where they might go ahead and rape a woman. So instead of having to do that, so they don't -- so they don't get wanting to go do that”. Did he say that.
Steve Robel: Yes.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, do you have a recollection of Gavin's interview of January -- January 19th of 2004.
Steve Robel: That's going to fall under the same category as Davellin.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. As far as you know, though, from your investigation, that was the first time -- the January 19, 2004, interview was the first time that the kids were confronted with the rebuttal video and asked to explain why they said what they said.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: Did you become aware that Gavin Arvizo in that January 19, 2004 interview said that 99.9 percent of the things on the rebuttal tape were not true.
Steve Robel: I don't recall that, but I'd have to review that as well.
Mr. Sanger: And were you in general - and I'll get off it here - were you, in general, aware that he had said that Dieter told them to say what they said.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I should have objected earlier. I object to the fact that this officer is not established as even in the room when those statements were made. Lack of foundation.
The Court: Well, I'll sustain the objection. More importantly, the question, “in general”, calls for a conclusion on his part.
Mr. Sanger: All right.
Mr. Sanger: Well, I'll just ask you to review that tape as well, or the transcript again, to see if it refreshes your recollection if you were there. If you were, that's fine. And if you weren't, that's okay, too. Were there inconsistencies -- besides the one we just talked about, were there inconsistencies --
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object to that kind of talk from counsel. It's a conclusion on his part.
Mr. Sanger: “That kind of talk”. I object to the objection as not being proper. Let me withdraw it, Your Honor.
The Court: There's no question there, so go ahead and make a -- do a question.
Mr. Sanger: You talked about the inconsistency between the statement about masturbation on the stand versus prior statements. And other than that, were there other inconsistencies in Gavin Arvizo's statements that he gave over the period of time.
Steve Robel: Can you direct me to what --
Mr. Sanger: Did you notice that there were any.
Steve Robel: Both times regarding --
Mr. Sanger: Regarding anything. Other inconsistencies. You can say “yes” or “no”.
Steve Robel: I don't believe so.
Mr. Sanger: All right. On July 7, 2003, Gavin said that he called Michael Jackson at the Universal Hilton, correct.
Steve Robel: That's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And in August, he said Michael Jackson called him to invite him over, is that right. Page 18 of the August 13 interview.
Steve Robel: Yes, down here, that he “thinks he called me”. It's not a definite, but he says, “I think he called me”. I see that.
Mr. Sanger: It goes on, does it not. He says -- on page 18, when he's asked why did he meet with Michael at the Hilton, he says, “I just wanted -- because he wanted me to come”. He says, “Did he call you or did you call him”. He says, “I think he called me. And then we were talking, and he told me that he was at the Hilton, at the Universal Hilton, and we started talking about me visiting, so I just came to visit”.
Steve Robel: I see that.
Mr. Sanger: Now --
Mr. Sneddon: Excuse me, Counsel. Will you read the rest of the statement.
Mr. Sanger: I can read whatever you want. Let me see here.
Mr. Sneddon: Well, the last four lines of the statement I think --
Mr. Sanger: Well, then there's a question. Or do you want the next -- I don't have to do this, but I will. All right. There's a question: “Did he say, 'Hey, why don't you come over and visit'. Is that what he asked”. Answer: “I don't remember how it happened. But I remember I came over”. Okay. The point of this is that Gavin's current statements in court and his statement on the 7th of July, 2003, were to the effect that he had found out that Michael was at the Hilton and he called him, and Michael Jackson picked up, and that's how he got ahold of him; isn't that right.
Steve Robel: According to his statement, that's a correct statement.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, let's talk about something a little more substantive here. On January -- I'm sorry. On July 7th, 2003, Gavin said that he was masturbated by Michael Jackson five times or so, did he not.
Steve Robel: Yes, he did.
Mr. Sanger: And then on 8-13-03, he said he was masturbated five times and he ejaculated all five times, right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Now, we'll hold on to that. And let's go to another issue. As far as the timing of the incidents was concerned, you already answered some questions on direct on this. On -- I keep doing that. On July 7th, 2003, Gavin Arvizo said that the masturbation incidents occurred on “one of the last days that I was staying at Neverland”. Correct.
Steve Robel: I recall it as being towards his last days of staying at Neverland.
Mr. Sanger: Okay.
Steve Robel: So it was towards -- towards before he left for good, yes. That's the way I understand it.
Mr. Sanger: All right. If you look at page 30, the question is, “He said one of the last days, like towards the last days I was staying at Neverland”; is that a fair statement.
Steve Robel: You're talking about August, correct. The August interview.
Mr. Sanger: No, this is July.
Steve Robel: Oh.
Mr. Sanger: The first interview. July 7th, 2003. Page 30.
Steve Robel: I have it.
Mr. Sanger: Lines 20 and 21.
Steve Robel: I just read it.
Mr. Sanger: Mr. Sneddon just indicated somebody was confused. I don't know who he was referring to here, so we're okay. He said, “In fact, one of the last days, like towards the last days when I was staying at Neverland”; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: Your investigation eventually disclosed that during the last days they stayed at Neverland, there wouldn't have been five occasions when molest could have occurred; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Can you repeat that.
Mr. Sanger: No.
The Court: Would you like that read back.
Steve Robel: Yes.
The Court Reporter: Your investigation eventually disclosed that during the last days they stayed at Neverland, there wouldn't have been five occasions when molest could have occurred; is that correct.
Steve Robel: No. That's not correct.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, in August of -- in the August interview, Gavin told you, on pages 38 to 41 --
Steve Robel: Okay. I'm there.
Mr. Sanger: He starts out talking about the DCFS interview, correct. And --
Steve Robel: Just a second. What line are you.
Mr. Sanger: Well, I'm just -- hang on one second. I'm not asking for a quote here. I'm just trying to put it in context. On page 38, they're talking about the DCFS interview. Put it in context. You're welcome to read the whole thing, too. Whatever you want so you feel comfortable with it.
Steve Robel: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: And if you read that whole segment, it appears that he is saying that the molest occurred before, started before the DCFS interview.
Steve Robel: That's not the way I understand that.
Mr. Sanger: Well, because he is saying, is he not, that the purpose of the interview is to -- let me withdraw it. Let's put it this way: That's not your impression.
Steve Robel: That's not my impression.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. All right. Let's come back to that. Now, if you go to the 11-25-03 interview, look at page two and three, he says that the acts that Michael engaged in, Michael Jackson engaged in, occurred both before and after the DCFS interview, right.
Steve Robel: Well, he initially states that they occurred after the DCFS interview. And then he thought further, and he said some of the acts, that he believes they occurred before and after.
Mr. Sanger: Right. And the investigator asked, “It was both. Are you pretty sure”. Answer: “Yeah”.
Steve Robel: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: And then it goes on, “Because I think you said it happened about five times, and what you're saying is that you're thinking it happened before and after that”. Answer: “Yeah”. “Both times. “Yeah. “Okay. Okay. That's all I need to know”. Right.
Steve Robel: Right.
Mr. Sanger: And that pretty much ended the interview. The investigator -- was that you asking those questions.
Steve Robel: That was me. Yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. That was what you were trying to discern in this tape-recorded interview, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Now, in January -- on January 19, '04 - again, you don't remember the exact interview. And you're going to review that and see if you recall more of it later - but did you become aware, as the lead investigator in this case, that Gavin Arvizo then told you he wasn't sure when these events occurred, and that you guys would probably know the dates.
Steve Robel: I would have to read -- was that said during that interview.
Mr. Sanger: Yes.
Steve Robel: Okay. I don't recall that. I'd have to review that as well.
Mr. Sanger: Were you advised that was now an issue.
Steve Robel: No.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And you're aware of his grand jury testimony; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Portions of it, yes.
Mr. Sanger: And in the grand jury he went back to saying it was after the Calabasas trip from March 2 through March 12th; is that correct.
Steve Robel: I believe that is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And you determined, did you not, that Michael Jackson was not at the ranch during that entire period of time, did you not.
Steve Robel: Which period of time are you talking.
Mr. Sanger: From March 2 through March 12th.
Steve Robel: Yes. Wait. Wait. I'm sorry. That he was not there or that he was there.
Mr. Sanger: Was he there the entire time, every day. Did you determine whether he was or he wasn't.
Steve Robel: Not -- from March 2nd through the 12th.
Mr. Sanger: Yes.
Steve Robel: There were some -- a couple of days, two or three days, that he was not there.
Mr. Sanger: All right. There were two, three days that you were able to establish he was somewhere else.
Steve Robel: Showing that he was off the ranch.
Mr. Sanger: Right. Now, let's take Star -- again, Star did not mention the rebuttal video or the interview by Bradley Miller before the search; is that correct.
Steve Robel: I don't believe he did. That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: Star was more detailed in his description of things than Gavin was; is that correct.
Steve Robel: There were two different acts. I -- he saw things going on and Gavin was actually having it happen to him. So, I mean, I thought that they both described them very clearly.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Well, there was -- there were conflicts in what they described. For instance, Gavin described his brother as wearing boxers, whereas his brother described that he was wearing pajamas, right.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. It's vague in terms of what incidents he's talking about.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sanger: All right.
Mr. Sanger: Well, when you interviewed -- I'm sorry. When you interviewed Star, he had already been interviewed by Stan Katz; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And you said, in essence, what Stan Katz had said all of the kids had said to him; is that right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: When Star described -- on July 7th, Star described walking up the stairs and he described his brother having pajamas on; is that correct.
Steve Robel: I believe you're right.
Mr. Sanger: But then he said that he saw that Mr. Jackson had his hand in Gavin's underwear; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. And you were aware that he had told Stan Katz that the incident occurred while Gavin was wearing boxers.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object again with regard to the fact that there are two incidents described by this witness.
Mr. Sanger: And I object to a speaking objection, because --
The Court: Sustained, both of you.
Mr. Sanger: It's a fair trade-off. Okay.
Mr. Sanger: In Mr. Katz', or Dr. Katz's interview, there was reference to a first incident and a second incident, correct.
Steve Robel: I don't have -- I don't believe I have Dr. Katz' interview with me here.
Mr. Sneddon: I'm going to object. I object.
Mr. Sanger: We'll go back to it. We'll just stick with what you have.
Mr. Sanger: So on the first interview -- I mean, on the first incident, the first incident on July 7th, there's discussion of sleeping -- Gavin sleeping in pajamas, but then Michael Jackson reaching into Gavin's underwear, right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: On August 13, Star says Michael Jackson put his hand into Gavin's boxers; is that correct.
Steve Robel: I believe that's correct.
Mr. Sanger: And on November 25th, 2003, Gavin said -- I mean, Star said that Gavin was wearing underwear, specifically because Michael Jackson told him to sleep in his underwear, right.
Steve Robel: I'm looking over it. You're talking about the interview on the 25th, correct.
Mr. Sanger: On November the 25th.
Steve Robel: With Star.
Mr. Sanger: Yes.
Steve Robel: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: And he said -- he said that; is that right.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And then he said that Michael Jackson had his hand in Gavin's underwear, correct.
Steve Robel: Correct.
Mr. Sanger: And he also said that this incident occurred five days or a week after February 20th; is that right.
Steve Robel: Are we on the same interview.
Mr. Sanger: Yes.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And that this was -- no incident of masturbation occurred before this.
Steve Robel: Before the --
Mr. Sanger: Before this one that he just described as being five days to a week after February 20.
Steve Robel: Right.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, in the Stan Katz interview with Paul Zelis, what Paul Zelis told you about his interview with Stan Katz, there was no mention of a second incident of masturbation.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object. It's double -- triple hearsay.
The Court: Sustained.
Mr. Sanger: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: And on July 7th, Star told you that there was a second incident of masturbation; is that correct.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: Now, on the 13th, it wasn't clear from the interview as to what incident he was talking about, it wasn't clearly delineated between two incidents; is that right.
Mr. Sneddon: Your Honor, I'm going to object to that, too. That's a statement of counsel testifying.
Mr. Sanger: I'm asking the witness who conducted the interview
Steve Robel: If it was --
The Court: Just a moment. I'll overrule the objection. Do you want the question read back.
Steve Robel: Yes, sir.
The Court Reporter: Now, on the 13th, it wasn't clear from the interview as to what incident he was talking about, it wasn't clearly delineated between two incidents; is that right.
Steve Robel: To the best of my knowledge, during that interview, he was -- as I understood it, he was very clear on both incidences that he saw.
Mr. Sanger: Well, he said that Gavin was wearing boxers during an incident which may or may not be the first or the second incident or both.
Steve Robel: Okay. So you're --
Mr. Sanger: I'm asking you. Did he say he was wearing boxers. Did he tell you box -- Gavin was wearing anything other than boxers when he described the incidents on August 13th.
Steve Robel: I believe he said pajamas.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. The second incident he said pajamas.
Steve Robel: I'm going to look at that.
Mr. Sanger: All right.
Steve Robel: What page are you on. That's July 7th.
Mr. Sanger: No, this is August 13.
Steve Robel: What page are you on.
Mr. Sanger: I'm trying to find it for you here. Your recollection -- what we're looking for -- your recollection is that he talked about wearing pajamas on August 13th for the second incident.
Steve Robel: Well, I need to look at it.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. I'm looking at page 17.
Steve Robel: Okay.
Mr. Sanger: It says “boxers”, right.
Steve Robel: Yes, down at the bottom, it does. “His brother's boxers”. Are you talking about line 23.
Mr. Sanger: Right. So once again, with Star, you'd have to review the January 19th tape and/or transcript to tell me whether or not you recall what he said specifically about the video.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: But you do know from your investigation that essentially he said Dieter made them memorize lines and say things like “father” and “humble” and so on; is that correct.
Steve Robel: To the best of my recollection, yes.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Just as a follow-up on something here. I had asked you about Mr. Sneddon going down to Los Angeles and interviewing Janet Arvizo, I believe, okay. Your answer was you don't recall that happening or you don't recall when it happened.
Steve Robel: No, I did recall him going down there. And I don't recall the date that that occurred. And it wasn't for an interview. It was for forms to be signed.
Mr. Sanger: All right. It was sometime before -- before the 18th. Okay. Now, you've been -- I think you told us you've been a sheriff for a long time, 20-some years, right.
Steve Robel: Yes. Approximately 22.
Mr. Sanger: And you were not personally -- or were you personally involved in investigating Mr. Jackson anytime prior to the time that you -- you commenced your investigation in -- whenever you told us, June 20 or so.
Steve Robel: No, that was the first time.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So June 20, you had information that had been obtained from Dr. Katz, and July 7th, you proceed to interview the kids, right.
Steve Robel: That is correct.
Mr. Sanger: And on that date, you indicated that, “We're going to try our best to make this case work”; is that correct.
Steve Robel: Let me refer to that.
Mr. Sanger: You can look at -- it's in Davellin's interview, page 33.
Steve Robel: Okay. I'm on page 33. There was quite a bit more where that -- in addition to what I said in regards to that.
Mr. Sanger: Well, we can read the whole thing.
Steve Robel: Okay. I already read the whole thing.
Mr. Sanger: All right. So you said to Davellin at the -- towards the end of her interview, “Okay. Okay. One thing I wanted to say and emphasize to you is that you guys are doing the right thing here. You know what, I know it's scary, and I realize -- really realize that you guys are going through a lot and you've been through a lot as a family. They're the ones that have done wrong, not you. And trust me in this, and trust Detective Zelis, we're law enforcement. We're going to try our best to make this case work. I can't guarantee it, where it's going to go from here, but that's why we're interviewing everybody involved. I don't care how much money they have” - do you want me to keep going. - “who he is, what -- but he's done wrong. You guys are the victims. Your family is. He is wrong in what he's done. We're going to try our best. Can't guarantee it. We're going to try our best to bring him to justice”. Did you say that.
Steve Robel: I definitely said that.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. So that's not the statement of somebody who has an open mind who's looking to see whether or not these people are telling the truth, is it.
Steve Robel: That statement, Mr. Sanger, is what -- through my courses that I've had -- and you have victims that are terrified in coming forward to law enforcement. That is to reassure them that they are not the suspects or they are the victims in the case. And I was reassuring them through that and letting them know that they are doing the right thing, because they were terrified when they came forward. And it took us about two weeks to get them to come forward and up here to be interviewed.
Mr. Sanger: Okay. Now, when you say that the technique that you're taught is to reassure people that if they're telling the truth and coming forward and being honest that they have nothing to fear, right. It's not to tell them that they're right and somebody else is wrong and you're going to get them. That's your -- that's your version of the speech, isn't it.
Steve Robel: That -- my version of the speech is what I just explained.
Mr. Sanger: It is.
Steve Robel: And they were concerned about coming forward to law enforcement, and they were concerned about whether they were going to make the case or not. And I told them we would try our best.
Mr. Sanger: And from the beginning, you have made a concerted effort to make this case work, have you not.
Steve Robel: Yep. I did.
Mr. Sanger: All right. Now, we have three minutes. But Detective Robel does need to look at the materials. And I don't -- I could ask three minutes of silly questions, but I'll spare you that, Your Honor. I don't have another question for him until he does that.
The Court: You're threatening me with silly questions.
Mr. Sanger: Yes.
The Court: All right. I don't think you're bluffing, so we'll call it. (Laughter.)
